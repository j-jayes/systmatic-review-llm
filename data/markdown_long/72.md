  Preface
   Being the product of three writers, and ranging as it does over wide
   expanses of literature in the fields of industrial sociology, political
   economy and the history of technology, this book has relied on many
   people in its preparation. The three authors have worked together, in
   various combinations, on some of its themes from the late 1970s, first
    in the Department of Science and Technology Policy at the
    University of Manchester where one of us (Kenneth Green) still
    lectures. Subsequently, we have continued our work on the ‘political
   economy of technological change’, one of us (Rod Coombs) as a
    lecturer in innovation at the University of Manchester Institute of
   Science and Technology and the other (Phil Blackburn) as a
    researcher in industrial policy at the Economic Policy Group of the
   Greater London Council. In all these institutions, we have discussed
    the issues we raise here in classrooms, seminars and meetings and we
   would like to thank all those who have helped us to formulate our
    ideas. In particular we would like to thank those with whom we have
   worked and on whose writings we have drawn in various chapters of
    the book — Julian Cohen, Jeff Atkinson, Alan Bornat, Heather
   Aspinwall, Nick Higgett and Penelope Whitehead. Especial thanks
    to Elena Softley who has allowed us to use extracts from her thesis on
   word-processing and office organisation in our discussion of neo-
   Fordism in clerical work in Chapter 7.
    Many of the ideas have been aired at conferences, in Britain and
    abroad, particularly at various international seminars on long waves,
    annual meetings of the Conference of Socialist Economists and, in
    1981-2, meetings of the Group for Alternative Science and Tech-
   nology Strategies. We would like to thank Chris Freeman, Bryn
    Jones and Sonia Liff who have, in one or other of these forums,
   helped us to a better understanding of the political, social and
   economic dimensions of technological change. Viv Walsh, Jon
   Turney and editorial consultant Keith Povey are to be thanked for
    their useful comments on the final draft, and the authors are indebted
    to Yvonne Aspinall, Collette White, Gill Greensides, Maggie Soltani
    and Barbara Wilkinson (who tragically died during the final stages of

 1 Introduction
 INTRODUCTION
 Public interest in technology appears to move in waves. From World
 War Two to the late 1960s technological developments — particularly
 prestigious ones like atomic power, space technologies and
 ‘automation’ — were embraced by people of all political persuasions
 as essential contributors to a rapidly growing economy. By the late
 1960s this enthusiasm had become tempered by a concern for the
 undesirable aspects of technology. This was stimulated by the
 appalling demonstration of technologically-based American military
 might in Vietnam, by the massive spending by rich states on prestige
 projects (particularly in aerospace) in a world still riven with hunger
 and poverty and by the accumulation of a host of environmental
 problems in air, water and land produced as side-effects of post-war
 economic growth.
  The 1970s were a time of ecological and political critiques of
 scientific, technological and medical developments. Expensive pro-
 grammes in aerospace and nuclear technologies were run down, after
 substantial political struggles, and new agencies were established with
 more stringent guidelines to regulate industrial processes and
 consumer products. But from the late 1970s, coinciding with the
 arrival of a deep depression in economic activity, interest in
 technology has risen again — focused this time not on the costs and
 benefits of large-scale technologies but on developments in micro-
 electronics and its applications, computer-assisted production pro-
 cesses, robotics, telecommunications and information technology.
  In all advanced capitalist countries these developments have
 become the subject of substantial political argument as governments
 seek to harness them to their programmes for economic recovery.
 Massive investments by private and public telecommunications
 organisations are in train to provide, so they hope, the infrastructure
 for an information technology ‘revolution’ which will stimulate new
 markets and offer new profitable areas for firms emerging from the

```

-----

```
    slump. Indeed micro-electronics and information technologies, in
    their entirety, are seen as ‘historic’ developments, whose significance
    in their effects on economic and social structures will turn out to be as
    important as were the application of steam power in the Industrial
    Revolution, electricity in the late nineteenth century and auto-
    mobiles, aeroplanes and plastics since the 1920s.”
     Much of this is exaggeration; there are not enough years left in this
    century in which to cram all the predicted technological revolutions.
    Nevertheless it is plain that these new technological developments,
    fixed into new manufacturing processes, into new products and into
    new modes of delivery of producer and consumer services are
    involved in some important changes which are taking place. These
    are changes that are seeh in the industrial structure of all countries, in
    the organisation of production and of work, in the amount of work to
    be done, in patterns of individual and collective consumption of
    products and services and, in short, in the way people communicate
    with each other and live their lives.
     This book addresses itself to one aspect of these technological
    developments, namely, what is the significance of current technolo-
    gical developments in the context of the prevailing economic crisis
    and how can ‘new technologies’ fit into any economic recovery? This
    question becomes a family of related questions. What changes in the
    organisation of production of physical products and of services ‘go
    with’ new technological developments in such a way that the higher
    levels of productivity may be realised? Or, what changes in the
    industrial structure of advanced capitalist countries would seem to be
    strategically necessary and can be detected in their initial stages, if
    the opportunities for profitable investment in new technology-based
    products and services are to be realised by capitalist firms? Or again,
    what institutional innovations, associated with the use of new
    technologies as an element in the restructuring of production, are
    open to firms and to governments managing mixed economies in any
    incipient period of economic recovery?
     By discussion and elaboration of which bodies of ideas are we to
    examine these issues? Most of the literature on the so-called ‘effects’
    of new technologies, a literature which has exploded over the last five
    years, is of little help. It is frequently naive in its estimation of the
    speed with which the new technologies will move from the
    drawing-board to real-life economic applications or of the rate of
    diffusion of those new technologies throughout a particular industrial
    branch. In short, if it does not exaggerate the speed of change it is

```

 insensitive to the national and international social and economic
 problems and adjustments which any supposed rapid technological
 change would bring (Green, 1984).
  So rather than looking for insights into likely techno-economic
 trajectories of the next twenty years from the ‘impact of new
 technology’ literature, we draw on two bodies of literature which are
 somewhat more substantially founded and which we bring together,
 we hope, in a new and fruitful synthesis. The two are: labour process
 theory and long-term economic development theory. We try to place
 new technologies currently being developed or innovated into a
 broader context of historical development of capitalist economies,
 synthesising the accounts of long-term economic development and
 the analysis of technology developed by historians and writers on the
 capitalist labour process.
 LABOUR PROCESS ANALYSES
 ‘Labour process’ writers have offered Marxist accounts of the
 workings of the capitalist mode of production which focus on those
 combinations of human labour and technology in particular organisa-
 tional settings which comprise the heart of production. Over the past
 ten years, the touchstone for these analyses has been the book Labor
 and Monopoly Capital: the Degradation of Work in the Twentieth
 Century by Harry Braverman, published in 1974. We do not intend to
 give any extensive account of the contributions to an understanding
 of production process developments which labour process writers
 have made, as there are already several reviews available (Wood,
 1982; Thompson, 1983). We will be [using ] [the ] [work ] [of ][many ] [of ][these ]
 writers in this book. Nevertheless some general remarks are
 necessary.
  Labour process theorists have focussed attention on the rela-
 tionship between two sets of motivations which induce managers to
 change production technologies. One set of motivations concerns the
 conventional calculus of production costs. The other set of motiva-
 tions concerns the relative power of workers and managers to
 exercise control over the manner and pace of work. The labour
 process literature has tended to polarise into two interpretations of
 this problem. One stance maintains that from the time of the
 transition from ‘formal’ to ‘real subordination’ in the labour process,
 capitalist economies have displayed an intrinsic tendency to remove

```

-----

```
    the control of all the labour process from workers.* It is argued that
    this appropriation of control by managers creates a ‘deskilling’ bias to
    the evolution of production technology. This position does not
    necessarily ignore the cost motivations; it simply emphasises the
    control motivations. The contrasting position emphasises the negoti-
    able character of the jobs and skills which accompany any particular
    machines introduced into an industry. The same machine tool, for
    example, will generate different skills shifts when introduced into
    different factories, dependent upon the other specific factors present
    in those workplaces.
     These labour process analyses, though extremely fruitful in their
    focus on the relations between workers and the technological system,
    and between different sections of workers themselves, are of limited
    usefulness if they concern themselves only with the relationship of
    control and resistance between management and workers on the
    shop-floor at the expense of examining the wider context of changes
     at the level of the political economy. Those arguing the negotiable
    character of any labour process change and who are against seeing
    deskilling as a dominant tendency in the development of the capitalist
    labour process, still remain within that logic. Tendency and counter-
    tendency, one managerial strategy or another, old or new tech-
    nology, the focus is the same — the control of labour.
     Much of the literature has thus lacked an appreciation of the
    changes in labour control systems in the broader context of changes
    in production systems as a whole. In particular, there has been a
    tendency to see technology as either given, or else entirely shaped by
    the needs of a particular division of labour (which is either
    determined by management or by interaction between management
    and workers). Without entertaining technological determinism, it is
    possible to identify some constraints and incentives in the develop-
    ment of production systems and the technologies within them which
    are not entirely reducible to the explanatory variables employed
    by writers on the labour process. In other words, it is possible to
    identify sequential shifts in the development of labour processes
    which occur with discontinuity, rather than with necessary con-
    tinuities as assumed in labour process writings. This task is attempted
    in this book and the results are found to be related in an interesting
    way to the phenomenon of long waves in the development of the
    world capitalist economy.
    We should stress that we are using ‘labour process’ as a term
    referring to the combinations of human labour (in all its forms of

```

-----

```
 manual and mental skill in the conception and execution of
 productive tasks) and machinery/tools/infrastructures (‘technology’)
 which are necessary to produce some physical or service product from
  a set of raw materials (which may be the products of other equally
 complex labour processes). We stress this combination of the two
 elements of labour and technology because we observe a tendency in
 many labour-process analysts, eager to put human activity in its
 obviously vital place in production, to marginalise the technological
 element. Whilst such emphasis are important as a correction of the
  bias of some industrial sociologists and management consultants who
 place undue emphasis on the so-called technological imperative, they
 must not be overdone. One of us (Coombs, 1984) has suggested a
 return to a general concept of a ‘production process’ instead of
 ‘labour process’. This might avoid an over-emphasis on trends in the
  use of human labour in explanations of developments in production.
  In this book however, we have continued to use the labour-process
 concept because of its important ideological function in reminding us
  that labour is a vital element of production. We use the terms ‘labour
 process’ and ‘production process’ interchangeably throughout this
 book.
 LONG WAVE THEORIES
 As the economic crisis in the advanced capitalist countries has
 deepened, increasing interest has been shown in a set of theories of
 long-term economic development, called long-wave theories, which
 emphasise changes in the structure and organisation of industrial
 sectors which accompany successive phases of economic growth.
 Some writers have tried to associate the waves with leading industrial
 sectors consisting of products and processes which have played a
 dominant role in the economic expansion of the developed capitalist
 countries. Table 1.1 gives one version of this, showing the dates of
 the waves’ upswings and downswings. The long-wave literature is
 now quite large and the full range of theories cannot be fully reported
 in this book. Of those theories exploring the significance of
 technological change as a factor in the upswings and downswings of
 the long wave, those of Freeman, Clark and Soete (referred to in this
 book, in shorthand, as Freeman) and of Mandel are the most
 substantial. (For a review of the [principal ] [theories, ] [see ] [Delbeke, ]
 1981.)

          (1980).
     In the work of Freeman et al. (1982) the starting point for the
    description of the long wave is a rejection of the hypothesis (put
    forward by Mensch, 1979) that a cluster of technological innovations is
    created in the depths of an economic depression. Following the
    pre-war political economist Schumpeter, who wrote penetratingly on
    the last major capitalist economic crisis, they argue that many
    innovations are in fact serendipitous. What matters for long waves
    are surges of capital investment and the diffusion of technological
    innovations. Freeman proposes that the upswing of the long wave is
    characterised by the roughly simultaneous diffusion of a number of
    technically-related new products and processes with their associated
   new firms or branches of firms; they call this a ‘new technology

```
  system’. In Freeman’s view, these new sectors of the economy have
 the ability to tip the balance of the macro-economic system from
 prolonged stagnation and crisis into an expansionary, full-
 employment growth path, with a virtuous circle between productivity
 growth and demand growth. Secondary booms in consumer durables
  fuel the process once it is under way. This role is attributed to those
  industrial sectors-which exploited the technological developments in
  electronics and synthetic materials for the post-war long-wave
 upswing. Eventually however, this impetus is seen as necessarily
 subsiding.
    ' A number of factors are responsible for the slowdown. Market
 growth in new sectors eventually encounters limits, monopoly profits
  are competed away, capital and labour market rigidities create
  inflation in the long run and institutional responses result in some
  deflation. In the absence of a second ‘new technology system’ the
 combination of declining growth rates and increasing inflation leads
  to stagflation and eventually to recession. Throughout this process
 Freeman suggests that the increasing cost pressures and the increas-
  ing scale of the new sectors will gradually create a labour-saving bias
  to technical change. He therefore sees mechanisation as a pheno-
 menon which is intensified by the recession, but he does not specify
  what technological form it might take, nor whether there is a
  connection between mechanisation, [capital ] [goods ] [innovation ] [and ] [the ]
  new technology system implied [in ] [the ] [long-wave ] [mechanism. ]
  Freeman’s account offers an explanation of the progress of a long
 wave from early upswing through an upper turning point, and into
 downswing, but it does not directly confront the issue of the lower
 turning-point except to invoke ‘socio-political factors’ without further
  elaboration. In common with several writers (Perez, 1983; Dosi,
  1983) he sees the extremes of social distress and conflict which occur
  in the downswing as capable of triggering institutional changes which
 permit radical change in the structure of economies and a return to
 long-term economic growth.
  Mandel’s analysis (1975, 1978, 1980) is somewhat different to that
 of Freeman’s . It is firmly in the tradition of Marxist economics and a
 substantial part of the proposed mechanism is a reinvestment cycle
 analogous to that proposed by Marx for the short trade-cycle. Mandel
 however suggests that major technological revolutions in the capital
 goods industries periodically occur, and that they cannot be
 accommodated in the period of a short cycle. Therefore over a
 number of short cycles a reserve fund of ‘under-invested’ capital

```

-----

```
    builds up which eventually forms one of the stimuli to a long-wave
   upswing. The major stimulus to restructuring however is the prospect
    of long-term profit rates being favourably influenced by changes in
    socio-political conditions. Therefore Mandel is also making the lower
   turning-point of the wave historically contingent, but within a
    class-political framework of analysis. The technological revolutions
    which, in his view, coincide with the three most recent long-wave
   upswings (1850-76, 1896-1914, 1945-1967) are steam-powered pro-
    duction of steam-powered machines, electrification and the internal
   combustion engine and ‘automation’. By this last term, Mandel
   means mechanical handling, continuous flow production and elec-
    tronic and computer control.
   ‘AUTOMATION’ AND FORDISM
    So, a number of long-wave theorists explain the boom in capitalist
    countries in the 1950s and 1960s principally in terms of the rise of new
    industries based on ‘new technology systems’ and/or on the spread of
    what they call ‘automation’ (which, as we will explain, is a singularly
    unhelpful term). In our view these explanations are only partially
    satisfactory, for two reasons.
     First, they display an inadequate understanding of what ‘automa-
    tion’ up to now has actually involved, seeing it as some qualitatively
   new form of production organisation clearly distinct from previous
    forms extant up to the 1930s. One essential element of automation,
   namely the mechanised transfer of items under manufacture between
    the machines or assembly workers (as in the conveyor line) had been
    in use in some industrial processes since the end of the nineteenth
    century. Another essential element of automation, the mechanisation
    or computerisation of the human control aspects of any production
    activity was, to say the least, in its very early stages in the 1950s.
    Indeed, as many information technology pundits declaim, it is only
   now with the application of cheap microcomputers to industrial and
    service production processes alike that the majority of production
    sectors, including those like small-batch engineering and office work
    relatively untouched by the massive productivity advances of the last
   boom period, are susceptible to ‘automation’ in the fullest sense of
    the term.
     Second, insufficient attention is paid to changes in non-
    technological aspects of the production process which significantly

 facilitated the last boom. The successful introduction and diffusion of
 any new technology system requires some related radical reorganisa-
 tion of the non-technological parts of the production process. As
 labour-process theorists have pointed out, the application of the
 particular technological systems that were implicated in the last boom
 required a particular form of labour discipline, division and manage-
 ment which had been created in the high unemployment and slump
 conditions of the inter-war years. Without the prior establishment of
  a labour force accustomed and willing (because it had no option) to
 take up the unskilled jobs of assembly and packing in mass
 production industries or suitably technically-trained in the complex
 tasks of product and process design, production planning and
 management, then no mass-production based, employment-generating
 boom was possible.
  The past fifty years have seen phenomenal changes in the structure
 of production and consumption, both in terms of the nature and
 quantity of the physical goods and services produced and consumed
 and in terms of the productivity and the manner of reproduction of
 the labour they require. These changes are the result of a variety of
 technical and economic developments. New industries have arisen by
 exploiting the products of investment in scientific research. Highly
 mechanised systems of production have come to many industrial
  sectors; now new capital equipment is clearly poised to enter many
 others, even those sectors (like banking or retailing) not traditionally
  associated with machinery. Less often emphasised, but in our view as
 important as the other two, has been the rise of a ‘paradigm’ of
 production organisation in mass-production industries based on
 product standardisation and the large-scale use of unskilled labour
 for final assembly. This was a model of how production should and
 could be organised and acted as a touchstone of productivity
 comparison even for those industries and services which are unable to
 adopt it fully, either because of the nature of their commodities or the
 structure of their markets.
  Furthermore, without markets and the consumption patterns of the
 population being geared to the large-scale purchase of mass-
 produced goods, an historically new situation, then mass production
 would make no economic sense. In short, any explanation of the last
 boom period needs to include some understanding of the develop-
 ment and diffusion, industry- and world-wide, of certain patterns of
 production organisation and of consumption of goods and services
 which we call Fordism.

   STRUCTURE OF THE BOOK
   Chapters 2, 3 and 4 explore the developments in mechanisation and
    the concept of Fordism further. Chapter 2 re-examines and redefines
    the concept of automation; Chapter 3, drawing on the writings of
    various historians of technology and of labour-process theorists,
    reviews the history of production organisation over the last hundred
    years. Chapter 4 explores the role attributed to technological change
   by various long-wave writers and presents some empirical evidence
    on the diffusion of automation in the USA and in Britain since World
   War Two. Connections are observed between the various phases of
   mechanisation and of production organisation and the upswings and
   downswings in long-term economic development. In these three
    chapters it is argued that the historically observed technological
   change in production is best seen as a series of stages which have in
   common an increase in the complexity of mechanisation. We identify
    three phases of mechanisation, which we call primary, secondary and
    tertiary mechanisation. Production technology however is not simply
   hardware. It is intertwined with forms of human control, co-
    ordination and planning in specific labour processes which, in
    capitalist production systems, are governed by the need for a
    generation of profit. Fordism, it will be argued, is that particular
   combination of technology and human labour which has broadly
   corresponded with the elaboration of the secondary mechanisation
    stage of technological development.
      It is reasonable to ask whether the current economic crisis, the
    recession and depression phases of the long wave as some would say,
    is associated with some ‘exhaustion’ of the Fordist paradigm which
    has now reached some limit. Is Fordism appropriate for the successful
    application of information technologies within those sectors of
   production which have hitherto not benefited from it — for example,
   small-batch engineering and office work? These are the issues we will
    address in this book. We argue that the post-war boom can be
    characterised as containing the combination of a specific technolo-
    gical form (namely maturing secondary or transfer mechanisation
    with emergent tertiary or control mechanisation) and a specific
   system of labour organisation — together comprising Fordist produc-
    tion processes. Any new boom will contain a new combination
    of those elements.
     Technologically, it is reasonably clear what will be one of the bases
    of the new combination, namely the use of micro-electronic-based

```

```
 and computer-dependent information technologies, though exactly
 what these constitute needs to be delineated. The likely forms of
 labour process are more difficult to ascertain. Nevertheless there are
 enough ‘examples’ of labour organisation around tertiary mechanisa-
 tion to allow some informed speculation. In Chapters 5, 6 and 7 we
 explore two industrial sectors in which information technologies will
 loom particularly large over the next twenty years, as new computer-
 ised control systems permit large increases in labour productivity by
 ‘mechanising’ highly labour-intensive activities of information flow
 and the co-ordination of production. Chapter 5 reviews recent
 literature on work redesign and seeks to identify an emergent form of
 technological/labour combination we call (in the style of Palloix and
 Aglietta) neo-Fordism. Chapter 6 looks at technological and labour
 organisation methods in small batch engineering. Various writers
 have looked at the changes in labour organisation following the
 introduction into small-batch engineering of computerised NC-
 machine tools. They have seen the changes in that industry as only
 partially successful (if not very unsuccessful) attempts to shift
 small-batch engineering from craft to Fordist systems of production
 organisation. We see them as partially successful attempts at a shift
 straight to neo-Fordism, a shift now facilitated by the availability of
 such tertiary mechanisation as flexible manufacturing systems and
 computer-aided management.
  Chapter 7 takes a wider focus, examining Fordism’s limits not just
 as a form of production organisation but as a form of the structuring
 of consumption, limits which would need to be crossed if capitalist
 economies were to revive themselves by an injection of information
 technologies as components of production processes and mass
 consumer products. We first explore the application of information
 technologies in clerical services and, as in Chapter 6, examine how
 the labour processes of clerical work are likely to be transformed,
 elaborating on the concept of neo-Fordism. However, the longer-
 term potential of information technologies is in a complete restructur-
 ing of many industries in the service sector which traditionally have
 been of low capital intensity and certainly have had little mechanisa-
 tion. As we wili discuss, some writers are of the view that some
 service industries — particularly [in ] [the ] [welfare ] [sector ] [of ] [health ] [care, ]
 education and public administration [— ] [are ] [in ] [urgent ] [need ] [of ] [some ]
 reorganisation if their high costs [are ] [to ] [cease ] [being ] [a ] [drain ] [on ] [capital ]
 accumulation. But any reorganisation [of ] [these ] [services ] [requires ] [a ]
 change not just in the labour [processes ] [of ][providing ] [them ] [but ] [also ] [in ]

```

```
    the services themselves, that is in the manner in which they satisfy the
    human needs for which they exist. We explore this consumption-
    restructuring aspect of neo-Fordism by looking at what is going on,
    and what information technologies offer in the longer term, in health
    care provision.
    We should say that although this book focuses on current
    technological developments, we are not trying to suggest that those
    developments will inevitably force changes in production organisation
    that will be the basis of a resurgence in economic growth in capitalist
    economies. The questions we raise about the role of technological
    developments in the process of restructuring of depressed capitalist
    industries seem important to us because they indicate the strategic
    options in the use of new technologies which might be presented to
    capitalist firms and governments. We agree with those long-wave
    writers mentioned earlier, that institutional and political changes
    have to accompany technical and economic change in order to return
    to economic growth. But a closer analysis of the historical develop-
    ment of production systems, of the type we attempt in this book, is an
    important gap which needs to be filled. It is needed to reveal and
    clarify the ground upon which political struggles over new technology
    will be conducted. Chapter 8 reviews the general arguments of the
    book and points to some of those issues, suggesting where alternative
    criteria to those of the market alone might find some space.

2 On New Technologies
  and ‘Automation’
 INTRODUCTION
 The last few years have seen the introduction of several new
 technologies into industry and commerce which are said to have
 ‘automated’ many previously labour-intensive production activities.
 Yet such automation has not in any simple way been the cause of the
 high level of unemployment which the advanced capitalist countries
 are experiencing in the 1980s. That unemployment, although partly
 exacerbated in some countries by demand deficiency as a direct result
 of government policies, has structural causes. The slump of the early
 1980s needs to be explained in terms of these structural features of
 the world economy before labour-displacing technological change
 can be satisfactorily analysed.
  Slumps are a recurring feature of capitalist economies, and they
 have a ‘function’ which bears upon technological changes. During
 slumps, competition intensifies for shares of declining, static or
 slowly growing markets in many products and services. This may
 result in the weeding out of weaker [firms, ] [forcing ] [rationalisation ] [and ]
 industrial concentration which nowadays [is ] [likely ] [to ] [be ] [on ] [a ] [world ]
 scale. This process necessarily [implies ] [the ] [shedding ] [of ][labour ] [by ][some ]
 firms and some workplaces [in ] many [countries. ] [The ] [rationalisation ]
 may involve more efficient use of machinery and systems [of ]
 production which make workers [work ] [harder ] [and/or ] [longer ] [(what ]
 Massey and Meegan, 1982, [call ] [‘intensification’). ] [Often, ] [however, ] [it ]
 involves a change in [the ] [products ] [being ] [made ] [to ] [satisfy ] [changed ]
 consumer demand or [to ] [increase ] [the ] [quality ] [of ][the ] [product ] [or ] [service. ]
 Furthermore, there may [be ] [redistribution ] [of ] [productive ] [activity ]
 within a company, either [within ] [one ] [country ] [or ] [within ] [transnational ]
 corporations (what Massey [and ] [Meegan ] [call ] [‘rationalisation’). ] [These ]
 activities involve technological [change ] [in ] [a ] [variety ] [of ][forms. ] [During ]
 the rest of this decade [there ] [will ] [be ] [further ] [refitting ] [of ] [production ]

    processes — in both manufacturing and services — with new equip-
    ment. Likewise there will be further opening up, often in completely
    new geographical locations, of new factories, offices, etc., based on
    radically new technologies.
     But, although new production technologies have not as yet resulted
    in much job loss, because all the other rationalising agents have been
    at work on a much bigger scale, this is not going to continue.
    Radically labour-displacing technologies are still in the introductory
    phase of their diffusion curves. They are about to take off. As firms
    invest in the 1980s— and slump or no slump, investment in new
    factories and new equipment still takes place — the machines and
    processes they install will not require as many workers for the same
    level of output as the older equipment that they and their competitors
    are scrapping. Much depends, therefore, on the opportunities for
    expansionary, rather than rationalising, investment, and on the other
    factors which condition those opportunities.
     Although classification is difficult, there are five main types of civil
    technological development which together might be held to consti-
    tute that ‘new technology’ which is expected to have considerable
    economic and social significance over the next two decades, although
    the degree of ‘newness’ of each type may be disputed. The five types
    are: micro-electronic-based technologies, information technologies,
    biotechnologies, new materials and energy technologies. (Elsewhere
    we have called these ‘Chips, Satellites, Bugs, Nodules and
    Windmills’.)!
    New energy technologies and new materials could clearly be of
    importance for any resurgence of economic growth, given the
    substantial changes in raw material and energy costs over the past
    fifteen years and the increasing emphasis on conservation of
    resources and reduction of pollution.? By biotechnologies we mean
    the genetic engineering of all sorts of biological species to produce
    new strains of plants and animals for agricultural use and of bacteria
    and fungi for use in the manufacture of drugs, chemicals and
    foodstuffs. Such developments may transform the chemical, phar-
    maceutical, energy, agricultural and food-processing industries,
    although not very quickly. Biotechnology’s economic importance is
    likely only to become large at the beginning of the next century,
    mirroring the importance of the chemical industry in this one.*
     But the economic impact of micro-electronics-based and informa-
    tion technologies is already very apparent and has been the subject of
    considerable study over the past five years. ‘Microchips’ have already

 been incorporated in numerous industrial and consumer products and
 this will continue at a rapid pace. The reduction in the number of
 metal-worked electro-mechanical components in domestic consumer
 products (washing machines, typewriters etc.) and their partial
 replacement by low labour-content micro-electronic components,
 reduces the need for metalworkers to make the now obsolescent
 metal parts and also reduces the number of assembly workers
 required. When a new product is being designed, it will become
 routine, as it has become in the watch and calculator industries, to
 assume that the product should incorporate the smallest number of
 standardised electronic components requiring much less labour in
 assembly.*
  Particularly important for any analysis of trends in automation is
 the development of cheap and versatile computer systems which can
 be incorporated into a variety of industrial and service production
 processes. Together with other components of so-called ‘information
 technology’, namely office machinery and telecommunication sys-
 tems, these will make up the largest part of new technology
 investment of the next ten years. It is on these types of new
 technology that this book focuses.
 NEW TECHNOLOGIES
 There are four sorts of equipment which will be the basis of this new
 technology investment: robots, manufacturing process computerisa-
 tion, office machinery and the ‘electronicisation’ of information-
 handling.” We will take each of these in turn.
 Robots
 The application of robots to routine handling, assembly and packing
 activities will speed up over the next ten years. As yet, contrary to the
 association in the popular mind of automation with robots, very few
 robots have been introduced into industrial production, displacing
 very few workers as a result. At the end of 1983, there were about
 40 000 robots in productive use in the advanced capitalist countries
 (including 16 500 in Japan and 1750 in Britain).° Most of them were
 used for simple jobs like spot-welding (in the car industry, for
 example) with painting, injection moulding handling, arc welding and

```

```
    transfer between machine tools making up the rest. Their biggest
    potential use is obviously in labour-intensive mass production
    assembly and inspection of light industrial and consumer goods and in
    packing awkward shapes (for example, putting chocolates in boxes).
    It is on these applications that robot engineering development is now
    concentrating.’ We might expect that by the early 1990s, insofar as
    products are re-designed so that they can be more readily assembled
    by cheap, industrially-proven robots, the world robot population will
    have increased tenfold (OECD, 1984). This must mean that, other
    things being equal, the number of jobs in unskilled assembly and
    packing will decline at an increasing pace over the next ten years.
    This will have a particularly serious effect on women’s employment in
    these jobs (SPRU Women and Technology Studies, 1982).
    Manufacturing Process Computerisation
    The growing sophistication of computers means that they can be
    increasingly incorporated into processes and into individual machines
    that so far have been heavily dependent on human labour for control.
    Even when an industry is already highly mechanised (for example,
    chemicals) the scope for computer applications in the production
    machinery may still be high. Computerisation of the manufacturing
    process control system may increase machine speeds and throughput
    and the quality of the product can be improved by more rapid and
    accurate inspection and correction of deviations in the process. Since
    micro-electronic control equipment is also likely to be very reliable,
    significant increases in the productiveness of even already highly
    ‘automated’ machinery can be expected. However, while the
    technological scope in this type of capital-intensive process industry
    may be high, the change in the number of people required to operate
    the machinery is likely to be small, since the existing high level of
    mechanisation means that the labour input overall is already
    relatively low anyway. So, in industries like chemicals, oil-refining
    and some parts of textile yarn manufacture where continuous
    processes have been introduced systematically over the past thirty
    years, the inclusion of computers in new processing technology might
    have significant effects on productivity but without radically affecting
    the numbers employed or the skills expected, at least as far as the
    workers directly involved with the continuous process itself are
   concerned.*

```

-----

```
  There are, however, a number of industries in which the
 application of cheap computer control systems offers the potential for
 turning them into capital-intensive process industries. This has been
 underway in the steel, food and printing industries for some time.’ It
 is beginning in coal-mining in which the mechanised cutting and
 conveying of coal to the surface are being integrated under computer
 control.'° It is also happening in textile finishing. Although very
 considerable amounts of machinery are already used in dyeing and
 finishing textiles there has always been the need for skilled human
 intervention to assure the quality of batches of finished cloth.
 Computer-based textile-finishing control equipment makes up a new
 generation of textile process control which will have considerable
 effects on the number of human quality controllers in that industry
 (see Green et al., 1980).
  Even where the nature of the product being manufactured makes
 fully integrated computer-controlled process systems inapplicable,
 there is still scope for the introduction of individual computer-
 controlled machines. An example might be the programmable sewing
 machine in clothing manufacture (McLean and Rush, 1978; Braun
 and Senker, 1982). However, of more significance for economic
 change in the longer term is the introduction of such machines into
 the small-batch engineering industry. Small-batch production, as
 distinct from the continuous or large batch production of one good,
 has been an obstacle to the introduction of integrated processes. In
 general, heavy investment in ‘automated’ equipment cannot rapidly
 be recovered in small-batch production given the time taken up
 between runs in re-setting machines or even re-organising the factory
 layout. Also, small-batch production introduces constraints into the
 operation and development of production machinery.
  It is a widely-held idea that computer-based machinery such as
 computer numerical-controlled machine tools could rapidly be
 developed so as to produce routinely very small batch pieces to any
 specification — using ‘Flexible Manufacturing Systems’. It has long
 been the dream of designers of small-batch engineering manufactur-
 ing systems to be able to use computers to monitor production as a
 whole, in real time. The result would indeed be to turn complex,
 non-routine small-batch engineering production into a sophisticated
 process-type industry. Computer-aided design and draughting could
 be linked with computer-controlled machine tools in systems of
 computer-aided manufacture. Reductions in the size and cost of
 computers and an increase in their power will add impetus to the

```

-----

```
    development and diffusion of these techniques but this process will
     still not be fast, because of the significant technical and financial
    constraints. The impact on labour required as a result of the use of
    such systems in small-batch engineering would, of course, be very
    high. Such systems however, although under development in various
    countries, are still some way from being economically viable.
    Nevertheless, as we discuss in Chapter 6, they are important in
    understanding the strategic options open for economic recovery in
    the next twenty years.
    Office Machinery
    The diffusion of electronic office machinery is advancing rapidly. In
    the late 1970s and early 1980s, world sales of electronic word-
    processors were growing at a rate of 25 per cent a year (Werneke,
     1983). Other equipment, like photocopiers and microcomputers,
    were also diffusing into offices at a rapid rate. The use of such
    equipment, it has often been predicted, would lead to very large
    reductions in the number of secretaries, typists and other clerical
    workers (see Bird, 1980). Although word-processor-induced job
     losses have been partly concealed by the general recession, a recent
    survey showed that about a quarter of British offices using electronic
     office equipment have reduced the number of typists they employ;
     less than 3 per cent increased the number (Steffens, 1983).
    Word-processors are, of course, only the first stage in the computer-
    based mechanisation of office work. The 1980s are forecast to see the
    growth in the number of integrated electronic offices. As the survey
    reported, a third of the offices surveyed (mainly the smaller
    organisations) were buying their electronic products as single,
    stand-alone items, and a third (mainly the larger ones) saw them
     as the initial part of a full electronic office system. The rest were
    waiting to see how things went with their first purchases before
    deciding whether or not to go ahead with a fully integrated
    system.
     The principal reasons for investing in electronic equipment were
    that it enabled quicker text-processing, better quality of presentation,
    better services to customers and to management and, of course,
    savings in labour. So even though much office work is not amenable
     to substantial computer-based ‘mechanisation’ there seems little
    doubt that the introduction of electronic office products — from

```

-----

```
word-processors to facsimile machines, and executive work stations
 to electronic mail — will speed up over the next few years and as a
 result have major effects on the structure and size of office
 employment.
‘Electronicisation’ of Information-handling
The development of new electronic-based telecommunication and
data transmission systems means that a wide range of information-
handling service industries are likely to be transformed, as labour-
 intensive clerical activities are computerised. Banking might serve as
 an example here. The volume [of ] [business ] [in ] [banking ] [has ] [grown ]
tremendously in recent years [and ] [could ] [continue ] [to ] [grow ] [as ] [an ]
 increasing proportion of the [population ] [acquires ] [bank ] [accounts ]
 (particularly in Britain.) Employment [in ] [banking ] [has ] [also ] [grown ]
 considerably, but less quickly [than ] [the ] [volume ] [of ] [business. ] [The ]
 already considerable use [of ][computers ] [is ][the ] [principal ] [reason ] [for ] [this ]
 productivity growth. The [basic ] [trend ] [seems ] [likely ] [to ] [continue, ] [with ]
 several possible areas in which [computers ] [can ] [contribute ] [to ] [a ] [slower ]
 increase in employment [than ] [in ] [output. ] [Automatic ] [tellers ] [(for ]
 example, cash points) [will ] [become ] [more ] [common ] [and ] [reduce ] [the ]
 labour requirement in counter [operations. ] [It is ][forecast ] [that ] [there ] [will ]
 be at least 70 000 automatic [tellers ] [in ] [the ] [USA ] [by ] [1990, ] [compared ]
 with the 20 000 in [1980 ] [(Werneke, ] [1983). ] [The ] [banks ] [are ] [in ] [the ]
 vanguard of developing [Electronic ] [Funds ] [Transfer ] [Systems, ] [replacing ]
 paper money for [many ] [transactions, ] [automatic ] [cheque-clearing ]
 systems may be introduced; [there ] [may ] [be ] [a ] [tendency ] [to ] [create ]
 ‘two-tier’ organisational [structures ] in banking with High [Street ]
 branches dealing [only ] [with ] [counter ] [operations ] [and ] [regional ] [centres ]
 handling administrative [jobs ] [and ] [specialist ] [banking ] [tasks, ] [such ] [as ]
 industrial loans.!! [Such ] [reorganisation ] [would ] [facilitate ] [the ] [use ] [of ]
 electronic office equipment [in ][the ] [upper ] [tier ] [of ][the ] [system. ] [As ] [Sleigh ]
 et al. (1979, p. [67) ] [conclude: ]
  The net result of the various trends in both business and technology
  which are currently facing the banks seems likely to be that modest
  increases in employment are likely to continue for at least the next
  five years and that stability in numbers will be achieved sometime
  between 1985 and 1990.
  Similar developments, linking computers and other office machin-

```

```
    ery with new communications systems so that the handling of
    information becomes less paper (and people)-based and more
    electronic-machine-based can be envisaged for other service
    industries. '* The speed of diffusion of such equipment is very much
    dependent on the availability of the inter-computer communications
    equipment — the telephone lines, data transmission cables, satellites,
    microwave transmitters and so on. Such extensive infrastructures are
    currently planned or being installed in every advanced capitalist
    country, so it is clear that in the longer term, information technology
    has tremendous potential for reorganising the way services are
    provided to other industries and to direct consumers. (These are
    discussed in more detail in Chapter 7.)
    Conclusion
    So far, in discussing the sorts of new technology investment likely to
    have economic significance over the next ten years, we have
    emphasised the job-destroying potential of such ‘automation’. Of
    course this is not the whole story. At the same time as existing
    industries are being rationalised and the new productivity-increasing
    investments are being made in new processes, new factories and
    offices are opening to produce completely new products which are in
    effect creating new jobs (though not necessarily with the same skills
    as those being lost or in the same part of a country or of the world).
    As in any slump, job-destruction is accompanied by job-creation and
    what determines long-term employment prospects is the balance
    between the two in this process of restructuring. However, this book
    is not specifically concerned with the debates over employment issues
    concerning new technology, rather with the contribution of new
    technological developments to any upturn in the developed capitalist
    economies. It is assumed, particularly by writers on long waves in
    economic development, as we mention in Chapter 1, that any upturn
    will involve the application of new technologies to increase
    the productivity of labour-—to increase ‘automation’. Having
    outlined the kinds of technological development that might be in-
    volved in ‘automation’ in the 1980s, we turn to a more basic
    analytical question: what exactly is the phenomenon which
    ‘automation’ is supposed to describe? As a term, does it help us to
    understand or does it obscure the processes of technological
    change?

 WHAT IS THIS THING CALLED ‘AUTOMATION’?
  Introduction
  The term ‘automation’ was coined in the 1940s, and the breadth of
  definitions since assigned to the word, coupled with its widespread
  entry into everyday language, has made it of limited use as an exact
  description of any well-defined phenomenon. On the contrary, it has
 become common parlance for all the frequently observed ways in
  which machinery replaces or appears to replace human activity. It is
  for this reason that we have so far put the term in inverted commas;
  we will continue to do so throughout this book.
   Ever since people have become concerned with the efficiency of
  generating products or services they have constructed their notions of
  efficiency in terms of the saving of labour input necessary for a given
  output. At various times in history, concern over the favourable or
  unfavourable consequences of such increases in efficiency has
  become more pronounced. In recent years there have been two such
  periods. The first of these stretched from the early 1950s to the early
  1960s and was concentrated primarily in the USA, though
  with significant echoes in Europe. The second began in the early
  1970s.
  Early Discussions
  The literature of the first period has been surveyed by Cohen (1975).
  The significant features of that period of discussion can be summa-
  rised under three heads, concerning definitions, job loss and
  economic growth.
  Definitions
  There was no agreement on how ‘automation’ could be defined.
  Cohen identified over thirty definitions from the writings he studied.
  They vary from the broad plain language type to the more precise but
  strongly contested. They were notable for the fact that they generally
  fell somewhere between the language of engineering and the
  language of management or economics, as a result of trying to
  capture the notions of machines substituting for people and increased

   labour efficiency. At the most general level, some authors refused to
   differentiate ‘automation’ from technical change in general; for
   example: ‘Broadly, automation now encompasses practically any
   device that reduces the amount of human effort — physical, mental or
  both — necessary to do work’ (O’Brien, 1969; emphasis added).
   Slightly more specific were those who labelled it as the ‘latest phase
   of mechanisation’; for example: ‘[Automation is] any continuous and
   integrated operation of a rationalised production system which uses
   electronic or other equipment to regulate and co-ordinate the quality
   and quantity of production’ (Buckingham, 1955). A more specific
   type of definition was used by those who spoke of ‘Detroit
   automation’, by which was meant the mechanised transfer of
   workpieces (engine blocks) from one work station to the next,
   characteristic of the USA automobile industry from the 1940s. One
   generalised version of this last definition is contained in the definition
   of ‘automation’ as ‘systems engineering’, which implies large scale
   co-ordination of workflow as a prominent design imperative in the
   construction of factories. Finally, but perhaps more frequently, the
   ideas of feedback and control, particularly achieved by means of then
   emerging electronic technologies, constituted another style of defin-
   ing automation.
    Clearly, there are many overlaps between these definitions, and in
   many cases the same author uses different definitions in order to
   achieve a particular emphasis in describing a particular machine or
   factory system. One fundamental common denominator is the
   removal of human labour from identifiable tasks which remain
   similar in form but are accomplished by machines. A more subtle and
   specific theme lies behind those definitions which rest on feedback
   and control: namely that this represents the mechanisation of mental
   labour (Cooley, 1980). This theme seems particularly relevant to
   discussions of the effects of ‘automation’ on workers. It raises issues
   such as the turning of skilled workers into machine-minders, the
   possibility of new skills associated with the machinery and the
   manner of their distribution amongst the work-force, and the wage
   rates associated with the change of working conditions.
   Job Loss
   The main stimulus to the discussion of the 1950s and 1960s was a
   heightened awareness of the labour displacement consequences of

```

  technological change. One clear reason for this, at least in the USA,
  was that the economic growth of the post-war period was over-
  shadowed by a significant but, as it turned out, temporary increase in
 unemployment in the late 1950s. Thus one finds that many of the
  contributions to the debate which focused on the displacement
  consequences of ‘automation’ came from trade unions. Moreover,
  the issue was seen as sufficiently substantial, or at least sufficiently
  sensitive, to warrant the establishment of a US Congressional
  Committee of Enquiry. Much of the literature of the time consists of
  submissions to this committee (US National Commission, 1966).
   Of course it could be argued, and was argued at the time, that a
  second stimulus to this discussion was a genuine acceleration in the
  pace of technological change which was taking the form of a
  widespread diffusion of automated techniques into industry. The two
  reasons taken together amount to the now-familiar hypothesis of
  technological or structural unemployment. In fact, however, as
  Cohen (1975) notes, there was very little attempt to examine directly
  the rate of diffusion of ‘automated’ techniques into industry, perhaps
  because of the failure to define them sufficiently accurately to
  operationalise their definitions. Furthermore, those attempts which
  were made were quite simple and insubstantial.
  Economic Growth
  The discussion of the effects of ‘automation’ had a certain degree of
  overlap with a broader discussion which was developing at that time
  on the contribution of ‘technical progress’ to economic growth.
  Several observations have been made on the stimuli to this debate
  (see in particular, Nelson, 1959). Undoubtedly, the increased
  government involvement in research and development (‘R&D’), the
  huge increase in military spending during the Cold War, the space
  programmes, the nuclear programmes and the prominence of new
  industries which were based on technologically [intensive ] [activities, ] [all ]
  played a part. Despite the ever-increasing [complexity ] [of ] [the ] [work ]
  which followed from Solow’s (1957) paper on the substantial
  contribution of technical change [to ] [economic ] [growth, ] [the ] [points ] [of ]
  overlap between this work and [the ] [debate ] [on ] [‘automation’ ] [remain ]
  limited. What did percolate [into ] [the ] [public ] [arena ] [was ] [the ] [insight ] [that ]

  which promoted industrial [growth ] [and ] [therefore ] [gave ] [rise ] [to ] [new ]

   employment through new capital formation. The fact that economists
   remained unsure and even divided over exactly how this mechanism
   worked, whether it worked efficiently, and whether it might work
   differently at different times, prevented general awareness moving
   beyond this simple observation of the potential of technical change
   both to create and to destroy jobs. As one might expect, speakers
   from industry tended to emphasise growth and job creation, while
   trade unions expressed fears of unemployment and job deskilling.
    We can summarise this period in discussion of ‘automation’ by
   saying that there was little progress in clarifying the nature of
   ‘automation’ (a notable exception being the work of James Bright
   (1958) discussed in the next section) limited progress in establishing
   the economic parameters of ‘automation’, both at the micro- and
   macro-economic levels; and little progress in producing any empirical
   data on the penetration of ‘automation’ into particular industries, let
   alone the effects of such penetration.
   Later Discussions: Bright and Bell
   We are currently in the second of the two periods of extended debate
   about ‘automation’. Since the slowdown in growth of the developed
   capitalist economies which began in the early 1970s, increased rates
   of unemployment have revived fears of the adverse effects of
   technological change on employment. The notion of structural
   unemployment has become more refined and established and is
   backed up by more sophisticated analyses of the roles of capital and
   labour in production and by case studies of ‘automation’ in particular
   industries. A representative example of this type of analysis is
   Rothwell and Zegveld (1979). However, many of the same concep-
   tual and practical difficulties which beset earlier discussions are still in
   evidence. There have been few notable additions to the literature on
   the definition of ‘automation’. Therefore, the good reasons for the
   existence of the current interest in ‘automation’, namely reduced
   growth and increased unemployment, are further reasons for
   pursuing the task of clarifying the nature of ‘automation’ and
   examining the real extent of its diffusion.
    The enormous range and variability of the actual technologies
   found in industry usually undermine any attempt at watertight
   definitions of ‘automation’, so much so that one of the most rigorous
   of analysts, James Bright, was forced to conclude in the mid-1950s

```

```
 that ‘automation most definitely means different things in different
 companies and industries’ (Bright, 1958, p. 52). Furthermore, he felt
 that the only accepted general definition of ‘automation’ was
 ‘something significantly more automatic than previously existed in
 that plant industry or location’ (Bright, 1958, p. 67). Behind this
 deceptively simple view, which apparently abdicates from attempting
 an analytical approach to automation, is the basis of one of the most
 complex and influential approaches to the subject yet produced.
 Bright deduces from his description of ‘automation’ as an evolution-
 ary process that there must be a hierarchy of levels of ‘automation’,
 and that the evolution of ‘automation’ of a particular system can be
 seen as progression within this hierarchy of levels. These ‘levels of
 mechanisation’, as Bright calls them, are illustrated in Figure 2.1.
   It can be seen that from level 4 onwards the main concern of the
 scheme is with the nature of control, the source of the initiating signal
 and the character of the machine response. Successive levels increase
  in sophistication, with the ultimate level (17) coming close to
 contemporary engineers’ notions of artificial intelligence. It seems
  likely that the scheme can be applied equally easily to individual
 pieces of machinery or to systems of machinery. It therefore suggests
  that definitions of ‘automation’ based on transfer of work-pieces are
 incomplete, since transfer is often subsumed as a function within the
  levels of Bright’s scheme. Bright’s work confirms that what really
 distinguishes ‘automation’ from previous developments in mechani-
  sation is advances in control. It should also be noted at this point that
  the analysis is not dependent on any specific technology. The means
  of control are not specified, only the degree. As we shall see, this
 approach has strengths and weaknesses.
   Despite being formulated quite early in the supposed period of
  acceleration in the development of ‘automation’, Bright’s approach
  to categorisation proved so influential that there were no serious
  rivals to it for nearly a decade and a half. It seems, however, that
  there was little enthusiasm, or perhaps little perceived need, to use
  Bright’s work to interpret the history of technical change and chart
  the development of ‘automation’. People who showed the most
  interest in this piece of applied management science were, paradoxi-
  cally, Marxists such as Braverman (1974) and Mandel (1975) (and
  then not until the 1970s) who noted Bright’s dispassionate conclu-
  sions concerning the reduction of skill levels implied at the higher
  levels of his ‘automation’ hierarchy. It will be remembered from our
  earlier discussion that in the 1970s a revival of the ‘automation

 debate’ ensued and has continued more intensely in recent years.
 Although not integrally linked to this debate, it is at this time that we
 find a new and significant analytical contribution to the taxonomy of
 ‘automation’.
   Bell’s (1972) work for the (British) Engineering Industry Training
 Board on forecasting the manpower implications of technological
 change involved him in a painstaking survey of technical trends in all
 branches of this industry, but by far the most important and
 developed part of this work concerns the mechanisation of metal-
 cutting processes. In studying the developments in this area, which
 have been significant since Bright’s time, Bell found it possible to
 advance a more refined conceptual description of ‘automation’.
 Although he does not claim any applicability for this scheme beyond
  his chosen area of engineering, we shall see that there are strong
 arguments for regarding it as a useful basis for a general purpose
  definition of the scope of ‘automation’, given certain objectives and
 conditions.
  The main point in Bell’s analysis is this. He disagrees with Bright
  that control is the only focus of ‘automation’, and argues that every
 manufacturing activity contains some elements of three distinct
  processes: transformation of the materials of workpieces into new
  shapes, states, assemblies or forms; transfer of materials or work-
 pieces from one part of a production system to another; and, third,
  control of the other two activities. (See Figure 2.2.) His basic insight
  is that the levels of mechanisation or, as Bell misleadingly calls them,
  levels of automation of these three parts of any production system
        Degree of
     mechanised handling
                     Degree of

   can be quite different. A particular machine or complex of machines
   can combine quite high levels of what Bell calls ‘automation of
   transfer’ with low levels of ‘automation of control’ and vice versa.
   The ‘automation of transformation’ is, however, usually quite high in
    all concrete examples of contemporary machinery in engineering.
     In order to define a ‘level of automation’ (in Bell’s terms) we need
    to modify Bright’s scheme, where a level is simply a point on a
   spectrum. Instead, we need to speak of a point in a 3-D space, where
   the three axes of the space are the degree of ‘automation’ of
   transformation, of transfer and of control. This space can now serve
   two useful purposes. First, we can identify particular points in this
   space which correspond to real pieces of technology — Bell does this
   very convincingly for machine tools (and we refer to this in more
    detail in Chapter 5). Second, we can conceive of the historical process
   of technological change, which defines ‘automation’ as the movement
   of a surface within this space. The direction of change will vary with
   time and with the nature of the various pressures and constraints
   influencing each incremental step in the process. In fact, since
   machinery is never designed to one blueprint, but rather different
   machines for different purposes occupy different positions in the
   vector space, we should speak of the gradual movement of a surface
   rather than a single point defining technical possibilities. The shape
   of the surface is the determinant of the potential for ‘automation’.
    The debate over the definition of ‘automation’ is a complex one but
    it seems to us also to be an unnecessary one. As we will illustrate in
    later chapters, the various participants in the ‘ ‘‘automation’’-
   defining’ game have been trying to capture two different processes in
   one definition. Since World War Two the use of machinery has been
   advancing on two fronts. Incremental changes in transfer (using old
   and new technologies) and the diffusion of radical new control
   technologies have coexisted. Writers have struggled to capture these
   two different trends in some all-embracing notion of ‘automation’.
   Consequently, some of them have emphasised ‘feedback’, others the
   grander systemic properties of large-scale integrated production
   processes, others the notion of mechanised assembly lines for
   particular tasks. In our view, the notion of ‘automation’ is therefore
   more of an obstacle than an aid to understanding what is actually
   happening in the development of production processes. It is more
    useful to differentiate between three types of mechanisation than
   types or levels of ‘automation’. We propose, therefore, to use the
   terms, primary, secondary and tertiary mechanisation and to drop the

```

-----

```
 term ‘automation’ as an analytical category. The three types refer to
 the three dimensions of mechanisation (which, confusingly, Bell calls
 dimensions of ‘automation’) already discussed; namely, the mech-
 anisation of transformation (primary), of transfer (secondary) and of
 control (tertiary). We will use them to discuss the history of
 production systems in Chapter 3.
 ‘Automation’ and the Labour Process
 The three-dimensional scheme which Bell designed for his examina-
 tion of metal working, suitably modified in the way that we have
 described, has a generality and abstract quality which seems to make
 it quite serviceable for all manufacturing (and even some non-
 manufacturing) activities. Yet as Bell shows, it is capable of being
 made quite precise when required. He uses it to assess how the
 addition of new points to the mechanisation surface will affect the
 requirements for various types of skilled labour in the engineering
 industry. However, the scheme is not able to do this by itself since it
 does not include a crucial variable. When new technologies become
 available and are installed, a management decision has to be made
 concerning the job description of those people working with the
 equipment. There are always a large number of production tasks to
 be done and they have to be ‘parcelled’ into packages to make jobs.
 The skill level and the number of people required for each job
 depends on how the tasks are combined. While there may be a strong
 influence of the machinery to suggest a ‘natural pattern’ of jobs, there
 is nevertheless a great deal of scope for variation. This could be
 contested by one or more of [the ] [groups ] [of ] [people ] [likely ] [to ] [be ]
 concerned with the outcome, amongst [the ] [management ] [and ] [the ]
 work-force.
  For the present, we can note one very significant conclusion from
 this discussion. Bell finds that his forecasts of changes in skill
 requirements (both quality and number) suffer from a real indeter-
 minacy because of the negotiable character, though within limits, of
 the combination of tasks into jobs. For our discussion this means that
 the development of mechanisation is not simply the replacement of
 one machine by another, more highly mechanised or more ‘automa-
 tic’ machine. Rather, it is the replacement of one human-machine
 combination by another human-machine combination. In other
 words the process of mechanisation can only be understood as change

```

```
    in labour processes. The technological aspect of this change is best
    seen as One component part of the process and perhaps, in most
   circumstances, contingent upon the other parts of the process. This is
    in striking contrast to the popular technological view which sees the
    arrival of the new machine as exogenous ‘technical change’ and the
   work organisation changes as merely contingent on that arrival.
     In our view, therefore, there is a clear link between the technical
    literature on machinery and ‘automation’ and Marxist analyses of
   machinery as a semi-contingent part of the labour process. As we
   have mentioned in Chapter 1, it is only in the past decade that the
    implications of this aspect of Marxist thought for contemporary
   technological change have begun to be examined. One observation
   from labour-process analyses is particularly relevant to our attempt to
    identify more closely the nature of mechanisation developments.
   During the historical development of the capitalist mode of produc-
    tion, there has been a tendency for ‘capital’, through its management
    agents, to increase the degree of control over the labour process. At
    this point we must differentiate control of the labour process with
   which we are concerned here from the narrower, but related, notion
    of control of the actual manipulation of tools, etc., as described in the
   more technical literature of Bright and Bell. Managers are concerned
    with control in the broad sense. They take steps progressively to
   remove uncertainty and therefore discretion and skill from the labour
    process by modifying it, to bring the planning and conceptual
    activities under their direct responsibility and by constructing labour
    processes which predetermine the actions of workers more precisely.
   Braverman’s extended critique of Taylorism as a means of labour
    control, and of the essential continuity with Taylorism of supposedly
   ‘humane’ work design approaches is the principal reference point of
    this mode of analysis. We will discuss in Chapter 3 recent challenges
    to this ‘deskilling’ dynamic.
    There is a major ambiguity in the literature on the labour process.
   Some authors have tended to adopt the view that ‘capital’ requires
    control over the labour process almost for its own sake, that it simply
    reflects a continuing effort to maintain the wage relation which is the
    central pillar of the capitalist mode of production. Some, on the other
   hand, have seen control of the labour process as an objective which
    flows logically from the purely economic pressures on individual
    capitalists. Marxist economic analysis views competition between
    capitals as being likely, other things being equal, to promote
    technical changes which reduce production costs, increase capital

```
 intensity, reduce living labour input per unit of output and effectively
 embody more and more of the co-ordinating and planning function in
 the physical structure of the production process. This view sees
 ‘valorisation’ of capital as a more powerful objective behind capital’s
 struggle for control of the labour process, in contrast to the more
 narrowly political or power-centred interpretation of the other group
 of authors. We shall return to this point in Chapter 5. At first sight, it
 seems likely that both these factors are important, but the problem is
 to describe exactly in what way they are linked.
  So, what is the connection between this narrow tradition of
 labour-process analysis and the general (and non-Marxist) literature
 on ‘automation’? The answer is that they provide a similar base for
 describing what ‘automation’ is and why it occurs, although they
 arrive at it through different routes of analysis. Marxists start from
 the notions of labour process and capitalist relations of production
 and deduce that continuing mechanisation of control will be a central
 aspect of the technological change which is used to make the labour
 process conform with the social relations. [Non-Marxists, ] [on ] [the ] [other ]
 hand, start from the observed [characteristics ] [of ] [the ] [machines ] [and ]
 machine systems and find the changes [in ][those ] [characteristics ] [cannot ]
 be deduced solely from ‘natural [improvements’ ] [or ] [from ] [exogenous ]
 technical advance, but rather [from ] [a ][complex ] [of ][variables ] [which ] [look, ]
 upon examination, very similar [to ] [those ] [which ] [Marxists ] [are ] [using ] [in ]
 describing attempts to modify the labour process.
 Conclusion
 We have, then, broken away from the early attempts to define
 ‘automation’. They were inadequate, we would argue, because they
 all sought to define ‘automation’ by reference to technological or
 engineering criteria. The labour-process style of analysing ‘automa-
 tion’, however, whether done in the tradition of Bell or of Braverman
 or of both, as in the case of the Brighton Labour Process Group
 (1977), offers a framework intrinsically more useful to the student of
 technological change. This is because of its ability to conceive of
 technology in a non-determinist way, as the result of a process of
 innovation which is competitive between different firms and between
 managements and workers in each industry and firm, and is also
 influenced by the general socio-political circumstances in which it
 occurs. Thus we can hope to gain insights into the relationship

```

-----

```
   between innovation, types of mechanisation and capitalist economic
   development.
     Unfortunately, possession of an acceptable starting-point does not
    guarantee arrival at useful conclusions. The problem facing all
    abstract frameworks is their practical application. In this case the task
    is to examine the actual history of mechanisation in terms of the
    parameters surrounding the labour processes and economic and
    social circumstances in which machinery was designed and used.
   Given that we acknowledge some relative independence of the
    evolution of the relevant knowledge base (that is, scientific and
    technological knowledge) as an extra complicating factor, this will
    not be a straightforward task. Despite the endeavours of historians
    of technology, knowledge of the vast range of industrial machinery
    and its use, and especially of the machinery of the period since World
   War Two, is limited. In this discussion we cannot hope seriously to
   expand the detail of that knowledge, but rather to contribute to the
    process of bringing some order to the wealth and diversity of detail in
    existing material. Our task is to identify more clearly how the
    different types of mechanisation have developed historically, what
    technological means are used to achieve mechanisation and whether
    these instances of mechanisation have any specific relation to the
   economic, social and political relationships in capitalist societies.

 3  Mechanisation and the
  Labour Process from
  1850
 INTRODUCTION
 Looking back over the past 130 years we can see some patterns in the
 development of production machinery. The patterns have expressed
 themselves in leading industrial sectors at different times since the
 mid-nineteenth century. In this chapter we shall try to identify how
 those machine systems measure up against the classification scheme
 we have developed from the work of Bright and Bell. Of particular
 interest, of course, are changes in the labour process which link
 machinery developments to the broader structural changes within the
 development of the capitalist mode of production.
   It should be made clear at the outset that we shall not deal in detail
 with the wide variation in the rhythms of development across
 countries over the hundred-year span of this chapter. There were of
 course substantial differences between British and mainland Euro-
 pean developments, between Europe and America and between the
 ‘West’ and Japan. For example, Littler (1982) has pointed out
 substantial differences between the USA, Europe and Japan regard-
 ing the techniques of management which go under the name of
 Taylorism and has shown that this particular ‘ism’ took substantially
 different forms in the three regions because of their differing cultures
 and of the results of class struggles over workplace organisation in the
 1920s and 1930s. Nevertheless [many ] [of ] [the ] [basic ] [techniques ] [of ]
 Taylorism, transformed according [to ] [local ] [cultures, ] [were ] [favoured ]

    technological and production organisation developments which, even
    if not always contemporaneously and in their original form, have
    displayed themselves in the major capitalist countries.
   TECHNOLOGY AND THE LABOUR PROCESS: 1850-1900
    Before addressing this topic it is necessary to outline the context, in
    particular the preceding developments in industrialisation. It is
   acknowledged by most economic and social historians that in the
    period 1750-1850 the gross transformations of the Industrial Revolu-
    tion were completed in England — the creation of a national market,
    several manufacturing industries mature enough to export significant
    fractions of output, a considerable urban working class and so on.
   Though the changes from the 1850s onwards are, of course, immense,
    including the industrialisation of much of the north of the globe, they
    differ in one crucial sense from what had gone before. From this
    period onwards the changes in the industrial and economic system
    can be characterised as increasingly intensive changes in an already
    established mode of production, rather than predominantly the
    expansion of that mode of production from infancy to fully-fledged
    existence.' Of course, this judgement must be qualified by the fact
    that the capitalist mode of production is still extending its scope by
    penetrating new geographical areas and even new sectors of
    advanced economies.
    What were the principal changes in production during this period,
    1750-1850? Marx’s description of changes in the labour process in
    Capital, Volume I, suggests the following, by now well-known,
    sequence of configurations: first, a transition in particular leading
    sectors from individual craft work with little division of labour to a
    phase of simple co-operation, involving several workers working
    together in one place; second, as the division of labour intensified,
    resulting in the fragmentation of the foregoing craft operations,
    detailed tasks and detailed labourers emerged. This created a number
    of individual labour processes which could utilise simple tools and
    mechanical aids which were more consistent with repetitive work
    than had been the craft tools which were their forerunners. This was
    the system which Marx called ‘manufacture’, meaning literally the
   making of things by hand by collectivities of workers in close physical
    proximity (that is, in what where first called ‘manufactories’). At this
    stage, however, the labour processes of individual workers, and of

```

-----

```
 the overall collective of workers, were for the most part still limited
 physically not only by the dexterity and sensory abilities of human
 labour, but also by its strength, even though this was often
 augmented in various ways. Thus, the next phase involved the lifting
 of this constraint by the systematic use of mechanical prime-movers.
 This was the period of increasing use of machine-made, steam-
 powered machinery which Marx characterised as ‘machinofacture’,
 by contrast with manufacture.
  Machinofacture marked the beginnings of a transition of the
 capitalist mode of production from purely extensive expansion to a
 mature process which focused increasingly on intensive growth. Marx
 himself declared that it was only with the technical basis of
 machinofacture for the production of further machines that capital-
 ism created for itself a ‘fitting technical foundation’ (Marx, 1976, p.
 376). This transition to machinofacture began early in the nineteenth
 century in several sectors but only by the middle of the century did it
 become firmly dominant over manufacture in the construction of
 machinery.
  Machinofacture was, it should be remembered, not simply a
 quantitative increase in productivity from capital’s point of view. It
 was a distinct labour/production process which, as noted by the
 Brighton Labour Process Group (1977), marked the move from
 ‘formal subordination’ towards increasing ‘real subordination’ of
 labour by capital. These are the terms used by Marx to denote the
 distinction between the bare wage relationship (formal subordina-
 tion) and its augmentation by direct control over the nature and pace
 of work via machinery (real subordination). This real subordination
 was a pre-condition for the pursuit of increased relative surplus-value

    diffusion was not just through the firms of each industry but
    also within each firm; the steam engines were applied to a multiplicity
    of production tasks in the course of making a_ particular
    product.
     What is the significance of this series of developments for analysis
    of the historical development of mechanisation? Landes characterises
    the period we have described as one of ‘mechanisation’, one of the
    several precursors to what he calls ‘automation’, which he sees as a
    late twentieth century affair (Landes, 1969, p. 323). From our
    conceptual discussion in Chapter 2 the trend of applying steam-
    powered machinofacture could be seen by contrast as a major, initial
    step in the mechanisation of the transformation component within the
    three dimensions of the labour process. This is more than a semantic
    distinction. It provides an interpretive framework which helps to
    understand the eventual constraints, as well as expansive properties,
    created by this phase of mechanisation. Subsequently these con-
    straints contributed to shaping the production process ‘strategies’ of
    capitalists and the focusing of inventive and innovative effort toward
    initiatives which facilitated a second, quite different, phase of
    mechanisation.
      It is necessary to introduce a qualification to the analysis at this
    point. During the period discussed above, the particular phase of
    mechanisation taking place was relatively evenly distributed across
    several industrial sectors. It did not of course reach all sectors, nor all
    operations in any one sector, but it was sufficiently general to enable
    us to speak of it as a dominant mode of technical change. However,
    as the analysis is pursued further toward the present day, this
    uniformity breaks down. The phases of mechanisation which are
    identified below occur at different times, to different extents, and
    occupy different lengths of time in different industries. It is not
    possible nor appropriate in this account to document all this
    heterogeneity since the concern is to explore some generally
    applicable theoretical ideas. Henceforth, therefore, the object of
    analysis is a generalised production process, mirroring the leading
    edge of capitalist industrial development. At some points it will more
    nearly approximate to one industry, and at some points more nearly
    to another. Where possible these specific connections will be made
    explicit. This method is, it is hoped, valid for the purpose at hand,
    namely identifying the major types of mechanisation which have
    developed, what factors have influenced them and what their effects
    have been.

 A SECOND PHASE OF MECHANISATION
 In the period from the last decades of the nineteenth century to the
 end of the first war the pace of technical change, both innovation and
 diffusion, was extremely rapid.* The most prominent change was the
 arrival of new sources of power to replace the steam engine. These
 were of course the internal combustion engine and electricity. The
 series of incremental innovations which had greatly augmented the
 efficiency of the steam engine had seemingly diminished and the
 physical constraints imposed by steam power were increasingly
 becoming a commercial problem in the way that the limitations of
 human strength had been before them.
  The internal combustion engine was the first radical innovation to
' break this log-jam. Though it did experience a significant period of
 importance as an industrial prime-mover it was not to begin a really
 massive diffusion phase until the coming of the automobile, which is a
 later phase in the story. Instead, it was overtaken by electric energy
 in the field of industrial power. The reason for this probably lies in
 the relative costs of their respective primary energy sources at the
 time. Petroleum was still an under-developed resource, whereas coal
 was a mature product with a well-developed distribution system. The
 steam-driven turbine driving an electric generator possessed the
 advantages of greater primary efficiency than reciprocating engines in
 extracting energy from heat. It also had the ability to provide a very
 mobile, flexible and reliable flow of energy which could be used in
 variable quantities when, where and how the user required. Against
 this should be set, as a great barrier to its diffusion, the considerable
 difficulties involved in creating a distribution system for electricity.
 However, it can also be argued that it was precisely in this
 distribution system, with its consequent guarantee of an eventual
 market amongst domestic consumers as well as factories, that the
 great incentive for adoption lay. The great significance of electricity
 for the production process and for [further ] [mechanisation ] [lay ][in ][its ][gift ]
 to the factory owner of mobility [of ] [power ] [sources, ] [though ] [this ]
 potential was not fully realised [until ] [some ] [time ] [later. ] [Other ] [aspects ] [of ]
 change in the production process [at ] [this ] [time ] [also ] [deserve ] [mention ] [in ]
 order to assemble a more complete picture.
  The mechanisation of transformation, given such impetus in the
 previous period, was characterised principally at this time by the
 achievement of faster and faster speeds of operation of the
 transforming equipment. This rested on a wealth of technical

```

-----

```
    innovations, some minor, some fundamental, many of them con-
    sciously sought solutions to perceived problems in production.
   Landes mentions the following; high grade steels for tools which
   improved cutting speeds, making the machines themselves grow in
    size in order to provide these speeds; faster-operating textile
   machinery; the improvement of lubrication techniques and the use of
    ball- and roller-bearings. The replacement of hammering by rolling in
    steel and wrought iron production was particularly noteworthy since
    it initiated the transformation of that industry into the first of what we
   now call the continuous-flow production industries.
     But this great increase in the speed and scale of transformation,
   considerably stimulated by foreign as well as domestic competition,
   brought with it new problems. The great power, size, speed and
   expense of the transforming equipment merely served to underline
    the inadequacy of the way in which work was organised to flow
   between operations and the residual variability in the manner in
   which it might be performed. To quote Landes:
    The entrepreneurs of the late nineteenth century were thus goaded
    by necessity and spurred by the prospect of higher returns to find
     ways, first, to ease the movement of work through the plant, and
     second, to draw more output from each man with a given body of
    equipment. (Landes, 1969, p. 302)
    Yet it would be necessary to do more than ‘speed up’ workers; the
    nature of the individual jobs would, of necessity, have to change to
   accommodate the new organisational patterns associated with revised
   work-flows.
     This suggests that the progress of mechanisation and technical
   change was neither random nor pre-determined. It proceeds at least
    in part via a succession of particular foci, which can be usefully
   captured in the image of the ‘bottleneck’. At any point in the
   development of a production process, given a particular structure of
   competitive pressures, there will be certain nodal points where the
    penalties, the potential rewards to change and the means to achieve
   change, will form a volatile combination. Effort will be focused on
    this nodal point and technical and organisational change will be
    biassed toward relieving the bottleneck. This general phenomenon is
   described in more detail by Rosenberg (1976), in his essay on
   ‘inducement mechanisms and focusing devices’. Two of his cate-
    gories of inducement are particularly relevant here: first, the

```

-----

```
  presence of imbalances between interdependent production proces-
  ses and, second, groups of workers exercising (from management’s
  point of view) awkward degrees of control over parts of a production
  process. Both these phenomena were prominent causes of quite
  deliberately sought innovations throughout the nineteenth century.
  What is suggested here is that, towards the end of the century, these
  mechanisms shifted the emphasis of mechanisation away from simple
  transformation problems and towards both transformation and
  transfer problems, thus bringing into play the second of the three
  dimensions of mechanisation which we are investigating. It is
  appropriate now to provide some more details of the way in which
  this change occurred.
   The moves to improve the logistics of the flow of production were
  of two broad types. One fairly simple trend was most visible in those
  industries which produced large quantities of a relatively
  homogeneous product: textiles, chemicals, metallurgy, glass,
  petroleum-refining and basic foodstuff-processing; in short, the ‘flow’
  industries. Another, more complex, trend was visible in industries
  which involved some element of assembly or fabrication. The
  technical problems of moving liquids, solids and gases at all
  temperatures gave rise to all manner of conveyors, elevators, hoists,
  valves, pumps, tanks, meters, gauges and controls. In several of these
  technologies, particularly those concerned with large-scale handling
  of solids, electric power sources with their previously mentioned
  mobility and rapidity of action were particularly appropriate. Thus,
  electricity was involved in both exacerbating the problems by
  speeding up transformation, thus moving the bottleneck to the
  transfer system, and in solving them by providing the means to
  mechanise transfer to some degree.
   The dominant sector of the second group of industries, those which
  assemble or fabricate, was engineering. The mass-produced con-
  sumer durable industries were in their infancy. There were a number
  of inter-linked problems for capitalists in trying to improve transfer
  efficiency in these industries. First, work was often organised
  spatially according to machine type — drilling, turning, etc. This
  meant that work-pieces had to pursue a tortuous zig-zag pattern back
  and forth between sections of the plant before reaching completion,
  thus spending too long ‘idle’, away from the machine. It also meant
  that the organisation created centralised groups of craft workers who
  were in a position to maximise the bargaining power implicit in their
  skill and their ability to disrupt production far beyond the boundaries

```

-----

```
   of their own specific tasks. The second problem, while appearing to
   be more narrowly technical, also related to craft skill. The materials,
   cutting techniques and measuring techniques of the nineteenth
   century did not, in the main, allow assembly to be conducted with
   randomly chosen parts, from stock. The precision implied by
   interchangeability of parts was beyond the majority of industries and
   enterprises. Not only did this prohibit what we now regard as normal,
   namely the highly productive assembly-line, it actually made assem-
   bly the skilled domain of the craftworker, who was alone capable of
   ‘fitting’ one part with another.*
    The technical contributions to solving these problems were several.
   The increasing use of steel instead of wrought iron allowed greater
   accuracy, and the use of gauges allowed knowledge of accuracy. The
   milling machine, especially when coupled with improved tool steels,
   permitted accuracy in more complex-shaped parts. Precision grind-
   ing, both of parts and of tools, permitted the fine manipulation of
   dimensions still beyond the range of the machine tools themselves.
   The turret lathe, which carried a number of differently shaped tools,
   and which was later capable of rotating the turret and inserting and
   feeding the work automatically, was a particularly important innova-
    tion. It combined an increase in the mechanisation of transformation
   with some degree of mechanised transfer. As we shall see later it also
   contains a small step on the ladder of mechanised control.
    The organisational contributions which attempted to solve the
    logistic problem were no less radical and impressive. The most
   systematic of these was Taylorism. Either in the form devised by
   Frederick Taylor by 1910 or in techniques derived from Taylor in the
   subsequent twenty years, for example by Bedaux (Littler, 1982)
   Taylorism sought to prescribe work tasks. This often entailed the
   redesign of those tasks on the basis of maximum standardisation.
   With the establishment of planning departments to organise and
   monitor shop-floor work, actual production tasks would become, in
    effect, routinised (or in Littler’s word ‘bureaucratised’) and workers
   would be expected to have ‘minimum interaction’ with their work.
    Taylorism, as we are using the term, involved attempting to treat
   the human actions in the production process as subject to the same
   principles of mechanical optimisation as the inanimate functions.
   Such principles were of course inconsistent with the worker retaining
   sole knowledge of, or complete discretion in, the choice of the
   physical and mental manipulations associated with the task. This
   process is, in one sense, nothing more novel than the continued

```

```
  application of the principle of the division of labour which is at the
  root of the development of collective labour processes from
 co-operation, through manufacture and machinofacture to the
  present day. But Taylorism had other features.
   In the first place — and in the short term — it contributed to the
 changes from the turn of the century onwards which helped restore
  the trend of increasing productivity. It sought to reduce some of the
  uncertainties and the ‘porosity’ of the working day which manage-
 ments needed to control. It was a major extension of real
 subordination of the labour process and, as Aglietta (1979) notes, it
 was a very appropriate response to a situation in which the
 production process was not integrated by the technology itself. It is
 worth noting however, that Taylorism was easiest to apply in new
  industries with little previous history of craft working. When meshed
  with the handling and transfer technologies developing throughout
  industry, in the context: of large consumer markets, it became
 redefined within the classic ‘flow-line’ to which we shall turn shortly.
  In the second place, we should note that Taylorism, with its emphasis
  on control in the broad sense of authority, and in the narrower sense
  of control of manipulations laid the first step in the later process of
  mechanisation of control. Both these themes, mass-production and
 mechanised control, form the subject matter of later sections of this
 chapter.
   Let us recapitulate. The commercial and technical pressures which
  existed at the end of the first phase of machinofacture shifted the
  balance of the process of mechanisation so that it began to advance
  on two fronts, transformation and transfer. The key enabling steps in
  this were new and more suitable power sources, innovations in
 handling devices, interchangeability and precision manufacture, and
  Taylorist forms of work organisation. All this, however, must also be
  seen in the context of the gradual changes on the demand side of the
 economy. The most mature expressions of these tendencies were
 found in the nascent high-volume consumer-good industries making
  such things as automobiles, sewing machines and bicycles and the
  industries which supplied them with parts or materials. Therefore the
  real maturity of this potent combination of techniques was not
 achieved until after World War One.
 BETWEEN THE WARS: FORDISM
 Although the inter-war period brought many significant innovations

```

```
    in mechanisation and in the organisation of production processes, the
   dominant aspect of this period must be judged to be consolidation of
    the changes which had had their genesis and had accumulated in the
   previous period. We have outlined above what these changes were,
   and Landes characterises the inter-war period as one of ‘working out’
    these innovations (Landes, 1969, p. 41). This can be amplified by
   saying that there was extensive diffusion of flow and assembly line
   techniques, and intensive improvement of them achieved by in-
   cremental innovations.
     It can be argued, however, that what has been characterised as a
   quantitative change had in fact an important qualitative character.
    Aglietta (1979) proposes that the transition from Taylorism before
   World War One to fully-fledged ‘assembly line’ production in
    inter-war America of many consumer products represents the
   establishment of a new production-process type with a significance
   beyond the point of production. This judgement is part of a complex
   and wide-ranging thesis concerning the dynamics of capitalist
   accumulation which cannot be fully discussed here (though we return
    to it in Chapter 7) but certain of the key features will be outlined
    since they constitute a useful contribution to the analysis of the
   development of mechanisation.
     Aglietta labels assembly-line production as ‘Fordism’. He does not
    rigorously define it, but from his and others’ work it can be more
    precisely characterised.” Fordism describes in the first place a
    particular configuration of the production process associated histori-
    cally with those industries which have provided the most visible
   examples of the consumption patterns of advanced capitalist coun-
    tries, such as automobiles and household durables. Indeed, Fordist
    principles of production organisation make up the most dominant
   ‘paradigm’ for engineers and managers of large industrial and
   commercial units, though the term Fordism may not itself be used.
   The success of any putative new mass consumer industry depends on
    the extent to which Fordist principles can be applied to it; other
    industries where mass markets are unlikely to develop (for example
    in capital goods), measure the ‘success’ of any production organisa-
    tion changes which are being contemplated by the extent to which
   they measure up to some notional idea of what could be achieved, in
   terms of productivity per worker for example, where Fordist
    principles to be economically applicable.
    What constitutes a Fordist production process? Fordist principles
   combine various technological, organisational and labour manage-

 ment innovations in the production of a wide variety of goods. It is
 important to stress that the principles are applied to more than just
 the automobile industry where they were first put together by the
 Ford Motor Company. The principles are:
 1. The production of large volumes of standardised products, using
   interchangeable parts.
 2. A dedicated serial production process, often, but not always,
   facilitated by the mechanisation of transfer activities ranging from
   ‘the low level mechanisation of the conveyor belt assembly line to
   the highly mechanised flow processes of food and chemical
   production.
 3. A division of labour between ‘deskilled’, material-manipulating,
   machine-minding and machine-feeding workers (usually on the
   assembly line sector of a process) and skilled metalworking,
   maintenance, technical, planning and supervisory workers who
   are less machine-paced, if at all.
 4. Amongst unskilled workers an acute division of labour, consonant
   with the employment of the historically cheap labour of women
   and migrant workers in these tasks. (Male dominated car assembly
   must not be thought of as typical of Fordist principles here, as Liff
   (1982) has pointed out.)
 5. A set of techniques for the management of this labour; achieved
   by a combination of Taylorist and systematic management
   techniques such as the bureaucratic allocation of individual tasks,
   effort level payment systems, tight supervision and the application
   of work planning methods (for example, through time and motion
   study).
  Fordism is, in short, a particular configuration of the labour/
 production process consisting of a sequentially integrated core—
 periphery system of production incorporating highly prescribed tasks
 and specialised production machinery, making very large batches of
 standard products at very high levels of productivity.
  Given the importance which many labour-process writers, follow-
 ing Braverman, place on Taylorism as a defining characteristic of
 those production systems typical of twentieth century monopoly
 capitalism, we must explain why we prefer to emphasise Fordism
 instead, and indeed to subsume Taylorism under it. We have already
 noted that Braverman describes Taylorism as a set of techniques by
 which management seeks the monopoly of knowledge over how
 production processes (including workers’ physical movements)

```

```
   should be organised so as to ‘control each step of the labour process
   and its mode of execution’ (1974: p. 119). Such an approach, argues
   Braverman, allows managements to attack craft skills. However
    there is much historical evidence that Taylor’s techniques were most
    successful with /ess skilled tasks and had greater effects on factory
   management than on the control of workers (Nelson, 1975, p. 74;
    1980, p. 140). Taylorism supplied a set of bureaucratic techniques to
    attack the power of foremen and internal sub-contractors (‘gang
    bosses’) rather than skilled workers, by creating a more direct
   employment relationship (Littler, 1982). Further, Taylorism pro-
    vided means to develop standards for effort level setting and, to this
    end, increase the ‘transparency’ of the labour process by sharing
   knowledge previously monopolised by workers, rather than manage-
   ment itself monopolising that knowledge.
     Even if management should wish to monopolise the knowledge
    associated with the production process, this might not be beneficial to
   them in pursuit of their long term goals. Managements must seek the
   co-operation of the workers for production to take place at all and
    this might conflict with Taylor’s preferred techniques of bureaucratic
    task prescription, individualised payment systems and hostility to the
    existence of group working. Other management strategies which
    explicitly recognise the dependence of production on labour are
    possible; they allow degrees of worker ‘autonomy’ in exchange for
   commitment to broad management-decreed production goals (Fried-
    man, 1977; Cressey and MacInnes, 1980; Littler and Salaman, 1984).
   Taylorism as an historical phenomenon was conceived in relation to
    specific problems of indirect forms of employment like subcontract-
    ing in turn of the century engineering but, as it turned out, some
    Taylorist techniques (for example, time and motion study) were
    particularly appropriate to the setting of effort levels and to making
   economies in workplace and task organisation in Fordist organised
    industries. The ‘control’ which such techniques permit depends on
   whether various tasks can be bureaucratically prescribed and whether
    or not there are better alternatives. Even then, Taylor’s Scientific
   Management must still rely on some complicity on the part of the
    workers, encouraged by incentive payment schemes. After all, if
    Taylorist work routines were so good, then ‘working to rule’ would
    refer to a situation of strong managerial control, rather than to a form
    of collective worker resistance!
    Taylorism, then, differs from Fordism in that the former describes
    a set of techniques for the management of labour and the latter a

 particular configuration of a production system seen as a combination
 of process and product technologies with human labour in a specific
 form of work organisation. The use of Taylorist labour management
 techniques in Fordist industries may be particularly efficacious under
 certain circumstances, but it is only one approach to labour
 management. For this reason then, it is not appropriate to use
 Taylorism as a central conceptual tool in trying to understand
 changes in the organisation of production processes, since this
 privileges the control of labour as the central concern of manage-
 ments.
  To return to our account of the origins of Fordism, it is usual to see
 the principles of Fordism first being put forward in the second decade
 of this century by engineers and managers of the Ford Motor
 Company, at least as a total package (Chandler, 1964). Individually
 none of the principles was new. For example, the technologies of
 sheet-metal stamping and electric resistance welding, techniques
 crucial for producing the parts on which the Fordist production of
 cars depended, emerged from innovations within the US bicycle
 industry of the late nineteenth century. In the case of the sewing-
 machine and bicycle industries, though firms in these sectors
 pioneered the civilian use of standardised interchangeable compo-
 nents in their products, they sold their products at the top end of the
 market, thus inherently limiting the market size to that created by the
 rising disposable income of the American middle classes. Ford on the
 other hand, aiming his production at a broader market, sought to
 overcome this limitation by dramatically cheapening the production
 of cars (Hounshall, 1981a).
  There are several important implications here. First, Ford’s success
 lay in his ability to reorganise the basis of production around the use
 of simple (unskilled) rather than complex (craft) labour. It was this
 which enabled the swift increase in volume to make possible the
 continued growth of the Ford company in the 1920s.
  Second, Ford’s success in achieving the economic conditions of
 mass production must be understood with respect to his unique
 position as a monopolist in the new car market which he created.
 During the ealy period of Ford’s production [of ][his ][famous ] [Model ] [T, ][it ]

  Third, in achieving a progressive cheapening of production by

```

-----

```
   means of increased division of labour, standardisation of parts,
    routinisation of work and intensification of labour and the use of new
    technologies, Ford was able to maintain this position as market
    leader. However, such a position relied on continued growth and
    continual cost reductions; these turned out to be untenable. A
   combination of competition by product differentiation (developed
    particularly by General Motors, Ford’s rival) the costs of model
   changeover, the coming of trade unions to car manufacture and the
    effects of the depression, ended the dynamic of the economy of scale
   upon which Ford’s growth had depended.
     Fourth, and most important, Ford sought to reorganise consump-
    tion as much as he reorganised production. He not only reduced the
    production costs of cars but also created a network of dealers and
   customer credit schemes to gear up consumption to mesh with the
   continuous high-volume production. It is this additional feature of
    the transformation of consumption under Fordism which Aglietta
    addresses.
     Aglietta argues, as we have, that Fordist assembly-line production
    entails a radical increase in the mechanisation of handling and the
    fixing of workers to work-stations with the tasks organised according
    to Taylorist principles. He also argues however, that the productivity
    of such processes is so great that ‘capital’ can only generalise them if
    it takes active steps to guarantee some stability in the mass market
    necessary to absorb the great volumes of products. These steps
    involve the promotion of a working-class ‘social consumption norm’
    which is qualitatively and quantitatively ‘adapted’ to the types of
    production being developed. Some of the components of this social
    consumption norm are major items like housing and cars which
    require new financial arrangements to allow their purchase (con-
    sumer credit, cheap bank loans, rental schemes, etc.) as well as the
    provision of a basic infrastructure of roads, electricity grids and so on.
    Other components are less expensive but quite potent in their
    influence on life-style and on the manner in which labour power is
    reconstituted away from work, for instance, labour-saving consumer
    durables. Together with the material elements of the consumption
    norm there are institutional changes such as the dominance of the
    nuclear family unit and the provision by the state of certain
    guarantees, through insurance, of a minimum level of consumption.
      It will be clear from these brief comments that this theme in
    Aglietta’s argument (to be discussed further in Chapter 7) of the link
    between a transformation in the production process and a trans-

```

-----

```
 formation in the nature of consumption is a very ambitious one. He
 asserts that the establishment of this connection between production
 conditions and consumption conditions marks a new phase in the
 accumulation of capital. Its stabilising value to the accumulation
 process lies in large measure in the fact that it increases the possibility
 for the capital goods and consumer goods sectors of the economy to
 grow in a broadly balanced fashion. Aglietta sees this balance
 between the major departments of production as vital to the
 sustained post-war period of accumulation. »
  This link was not established either rapidly or painlessly, however.
 The depression of the inter-war period, with capital goods production
 in fact growing faster than consumer goods, with these consumer
 goods being restricted to luxury markets, is seen by Aglietta as a
 process of restructuring necessary to establish Fordism fully. It is
 certainly true that there was a dramatic increase in the sales of certain
 consumer durables in many countries in this period.® This is
 sometimes obscured by the images of the Slump of the 1930s, yet it
 does mean that the expansion of capacity in these industries, the
 economies of scale, and the newness of the investment made these
 industries centres of best-practice Fordist mechanised labour pro-
 cesses. These industries, in particular the car industry, had important
 effects on technical and labour process changes in upstream and
 downstream related industries. A particularly graphic example is the
 development of the continuous wide-strip mill for the production of
 sheet steel. It has been noted already that the earlier substitution of
 rolling for hammering has been a major step towards continuous
 operation. The technical potential of this step was fully exploited
 once it became clear that enormous demand for high-quality sheet
 steel was being created by the car industry and other consumer-
 durable industries. Once more, however, it is important to add the
 qualification that, in Britain in particular, the recession’s effects were
 strong enough seriously to retard the diffusion of the continuous-strip
 mill.
  Changes were also taking place in other industries. The traditional
 textile processes were relatively stable during this period. But, in
 complete contrast, there was an explosion of new products and
 techniques in synthetic fibres. With the exception of rayon, these
 products only grew to mass-production scale in the period after
 World War Two, but it is in the 1930s that the initial spurt of change
 must be placed (Freeman et al., 1982). The production of synthetic
 fibres, and of the other new synthetic materials whose introduction

    straddles World War Two, gave a further stimulus to continuous-flow
    production techniques, though of course based on principles different
    from those used in the steel mill. These examples of a different type
    of transfer mechanisation are in fact closely connected to control
   mechanisation which is discussed later, but in acting as test-beds for
   more sophisticated systems of control, they were in fact the
    exceptions which proved the rule. The principal characteristic of the
    transfer mechanisation which became best-practice in the inter-war
    period was its rigidity and low level of control sophistication.
     While transformation and transfer were achieved with less and less
    direct human involvement, control was established by one of two
    means. Either, control was achieved through continuous human
    monitoring and manipulation of powered devices, or else control in
    limited segments of the process was achieved via simple tailor-made
    devices in the machine itself. An obvious example of this latter
    technique is the system which uses the arrival of the work-piece to
    trip a switch to activate the transformation operation. The important
    feature of this sort of mechanisation, which is often called ‘hard’ or
    ‘dedicated automation’, is that it is designed to operate on only one
    specific piece of material and is useless, without redesign and layout
    change, on any other product. Its inflexibility therefore means that
    the cost of the equipment can only be recovered if a very long
    production run of the related part can be assured. Hence its
   appropriateness to a class of industries dedicated to the mass
   production of uniform commodities in quantities never before
    attained.
     The only alternative to ‘hard automation’ was continued reliance
    on human skill. Indeed, even those processes which were ‘hard
   automated’ still required some human intervention and were often
    only part of the overall production process for the completed
   commodity anyway. But reliance on skill in control, especially in
    relation to large-scale production processes, brings with it new
   problems for management in ensuring increases in productivity.
    Admittedly, a car assembly line, to take an example, is subject to
   more managerial authority than a workshop of skilled turners;
   moreover, the technical level of control is also higher since the serial
    operations involved in assembly are a result of systematic pre-
    planning and machine-pacing rather than relying on the craft
    workers’ judgements. In that sense, mechanisation of all three
   dimensions is higher. But a new sort of collective response on the part
    of the work-force is potentially present; and the interconnectedness

 and scale of the process renders it vulnerable to the smallest
 disturbance. There is no shortage of evidence from post-war plants
 with this sort of Fordist production process of the particular and
 dramatic nature of the conflicts which occur beween management
 and work-force.’
  To this well-known limitation of Fordism, Aglietta has added some
 others. One is therfact that particularly intense examples of Fordist
 production produce mental and physical exhaustion amongst workers
 which cannot be ‘recuperated away’ even by the benefits of the social
 consumption norm. The dysfunctional character of this phenomenon
 for capital is its consequential absenteesim and sabotage, which
 adversely affect the productivity of plants. This is particularly the
 case where the labour market is tight and labour is collectively
 strongest. Yet many of the worst jobs have been filled by workers
 from the secondary, peripheral labour market (women, minorities,
 migrants). Another problem which Aglietta notes is the increasing
 difficulty of ‘line-balancing’ as cycle times for individual jobs change
 frequently either through trade-union efforts or as a result of partial
 technical changes. Although different in detail it can be readily seen
 that these problems are all closely related, and together they form
 components of a new ‘bottle-neck’ in the search for productivity and
 can therefore be seen as a potential new focus of technical and
 organisational change. Once again the partial solution of one set of
 problems has, in due course, transferred attention to the next weak
 link in the chain.
  To summarise this section: the inter-war period was one in which
 the mechanisation of transfer (or secondary mechanisation) took a
 large step forward thanks to the combination of two factors. First was
 the maturity of the technical possibilities which had been assembled
 prior to that period. Second, we note the new circumstances of
 demand evolving in a cluster of related industries which made the
 application of secondary mechanisation particularly appropriate.
 There were however, signs of new developments in control (tertiary)
 mechanisation and of circumstances which might promote them
 further. Neither of these developments, however, took place to a
 great degree until the period after World War Two. It is to this period
 that we now turn.
 POST-WORLD WAR TWO DEVELOPMENTS
 Before embarking on an analysis of the developments in control

    mechanisation, it is important to emphasise the role of diffusion of
    transfer mechanisation in the long boom after World War Two.
    While some parts of industry in the USA had reached quite high
    levels of plant integration between the wars, this was in the main not
    quite so true of Europe. In the period after World War Two,
    however, many of the consumer durables which used these produc-
    tion techniques made the transition from luxury items to mass items
   owned by large percentages of the households in any advanced
    country. Furthermore, it is important to note the enormous stimulus
    to these techniques created during the war itself, by the demands for
   armaments under conditions of semi-command economic policy.
    Data on the diffusion of some typical transfer mechanisation systems
    can be found in Nabseth and Ray’s (1974) classic study on diffusion.
    These show that between 1950 and 1968 the percentage of car-engine
    blocks machined on ‘automatic transfer’ lines in Britain rose from 21
    per cent to 52 per cent.
      It must surely be the case that this rapid diffusion of the latest
    forms of ‘hard automation’ played a considerable part in fuelling the
    popular view that so-called ‘automation’ was ‘taking-off’. Important
    though this diffusion was, however, it was technically anterior to the
    developments in control mechanisation which were taking place at
    that time. Their diffusion was not at that time so rapid, but their
    impact on observers and on events was quite marked. Given that
    these two trends were occurring in parallel it is perhaps not surprising
    that the rash of definitions referred to in Chapter 2 straddled uneasily
    the ground from Detroit automation to feedback principles. As we
    have argued, the observers were trying to find a one-dimensional
    term for a two-dimensional phenomenon.
     What then were these developments in control technology? The
    most researched is the numerical control (NC) of machine tools. The
    technical components of this type of machinery have their origins in
    the tight links forged between the machine-tool companies, the
    aircraft industry, and the Defense Department in the USA during
    World War Two. The rapid change in design and sophistication of
    aircraft stimulated by the war, and by post-war civil possibilities led
    to demand for precision parts to be manufactured cheaply, but with
    frequently modified specifications. This of course is just what
    dedicated secondary mechanisation cannot do. The solution, a system
    of controlling the path of the tool which could be reprogrammed, was
    therefore consciously sought from 1949 onwards with the help of a
   development contract between the US airforce and the Mas-

 sachusetts Institute of Technology Servo-mechanisms laboratory
 (Atkinson, 1980; Noble, 1979). The system was introduced commer-
 cially in 1955 and its diffusion has been steady since then. An
 impression of scale can be gained from the fact that NC tools
 represented 20 per cent of the value of US machine tool shipments in
 the late 1960s and in the early 1980s they represented 50 per cent of
 the Japanese machine-tool industry’s output.
  In developing the theme of control mechanisation we now begin to
 complete the picture of the three-dimensional progress of mechanisa-
 tion using Bell’s framework. NC technology in its pure form is in fact
 only one point in a series of levels of control mechanisation and has in
 fact been surpassed in recent years. This spectrum is shown in Figures
 3.1 and 3.2, from Bell.

 The various forms and levels of mechanised cutting equipment available to industry in

     3. Handling systems
      Four categories of systems ranging from non-mechanised to highly mechanised
      transfer and loading systems
     This appears as a two-dimensional section of a three-dimensional mechanisation space
     in the figure. Only about ten of the sixteen possibilities were practical realities:
     1.1 Conventional, manually controlled machine tools
     2.1 Capstan and turret type machine tools
     3.1 Tracing and copying machines, manually loaded ‘automatics’
     4.1 Manually loaded special purpose machines
     3.2 Mechanically loaded ‘automatics’
     4.2 Mechanically loaded special purpose tools
     3.3 ‘Automatics’ with transfer systems but manual loading—unloading (an unlikely
       combination)
     3.4 ‘Automatic’ link lines transferring similar parts between ‘automatic’ machine tools
     4.4 Transfer lines.
    The remaining six categories of the section were not relevant to machine-shop
     production. Systems in the top-left hand corner of the section might be relevant in
     other processes, but more commonly such systems were at a much lower level of
     mechanisation of the basic transforming system. In assembly work, for example,
     although frequently there were mechanised transfer systems, the transforming was
     usually carried out manually, or perhaps with hand tools or powered hand tools.
    The ten relevant categories are closely related to scale of production roughly according
     to the following groupings:

     Until the 1960s, says Bell, metal-cutting in engineering had
    available to it only the first four of the levels of control in the
   diagram, in combination with four possible levels of transfer.
   Combination 4.4, the most advanced, was the transfer line referred to
    earlier as ‘hard automation’ (See Figure 3.1.) Level 5 (shown in
    Figure 3.2) is a forerunner of NC known as ‘plug-board information
    input’; level 6 is NC itself; level 7 is a development of NC known as
    Direct Numerical Control (DNC) in which the making of a tape for
    each machine is obviated; level 8 is adaptive control, in which
   feedback systems on a wide variety of parameters give the system a
    ‘real-time’ flexibility of response to add to its flexible memory. It will
    readily be seen that if these high levels of control mechanisation are

   In summary, the developments in the 1970s can be described in terms of the basic
  framework thus:
   ie Basic transforming systems
    Similar to those of the 1960s.
   fis The handling system
    Wider and more flexible applications of the three categories of mechanised systems
    available in the 1960s.
       . The control system
    Four new categories of control system, thus:
  Category 5:
   ‘semi-automated’ transfer of input information, with limited memory. This category
    describes the plug-board control, program-sequence control and possibly camless-
    auto types of system. In all of these, most of the information for a full cycle of
    operations can be prepared as plug locations, punched cards, etc. A machine can be
    rapidly set up with the information and left to ‘read’ this and operate accordingly.
    Usually only a limited number of possible variations in the information can be held
    in these ‘pre-packaged memories’.
  Category 6:
   ‘semi-automatic’ transfer of input information with unlimited memory. This
    category describes numerical control systems, which are very similar to those in
    category 5. Normally most of the necessary operating information for the full cycle
    of a job is coded on paper or magnetic [tape. ] [This ] [is ][manually ] [loaded ] [to ] [a ][tape-reader ]
   machine control system. A change [of ][jobs ] [requires, ] [normally, ] [a ] [manual ] [change ] [of ]

   memory is almost unlimited, but [the ] [machine ] [tool ] [itself ] [has ] [limited ] [capabilities. ]

```

-----

```
    Category 7:
      fully mechanised transfer of input information. This category describes direct
     computer-control systems. In the two [previous ] [categories ] [some ] [manual ] [assistance ] [is ]
      required to transfer the pre-coded [information ] [package ] [to ] [the ] [machine. ] [In ] [this ]
      category the information is stored [in ] [a ] [computer ] [and ] [fed ] [directly ] [to ] [the ] [machine ]
      tool. Normally this type of system involves the control of a number of tools by one
     computer, but the configuration of control system can vary quite widely.
    Category 8:
     computer-controlled systems with feedback control of a large number of operating
      parameters. This type of system tends to be labelled as ‘adaptive control’. In such
      systems, various output or operating parameters (e.g. workpiece dimensions,
      surface finish, cutting speed) are measured and the operation is modified in the light
      of this information in order to optimise performance.
                     * * *
   combined with high levels of transfer mechanisation then the genuine
    ‘full automation’ of the pundits looks more like a possibility. Such
    possibilities in handling may depend on robotics and other forms of
   computerised handling, which are discussed later.
     Bell argues therefore that the availability of these four extra
   notches of control mechanisation since the 1960s marks a real
    discontinuity in the historical development of machine-shop mech-
    anisation. This discontinuity lies in the fact that they render
   small-batch metal-working production potentially amenable to the
   same levels of mechanisation and unit-cost reduction formerly
    restricted to mass production and ‘hard automation’. Since perhaps
    80 per cent of production in engineering consists of small batches of
    less than 1000 articles, the significance of even. the partial tertiary
   mechanisation of this small-batch production can easily be appre-
    ciated. Furthermore, NC machines, either singly or in combination,
    can be used at key points in more traditional mass-production
   systems, and can even create new types of mass-production systems.
   They begin to blur the old line between mass- and batch-production.
   Writing in the early 1970s, Bell was cautious about how quickly these
   systems would be introduced and what their effects on employment
    patterns would be. He believed that these technologies would break
    the previous relationships between technical change and employ-
   ment, removing some unskilled labour from residual transfer tasks
   and de-skilling some control tasks. This suggests that there may be a
   considerable production-process change involved.
     This is indeed the view of Aglietta. He appears not to be familiar
    with Bell’s work but his diagnosis of the significance of this particular
    type of mechanisation is essentially similar. He labels it ‘Neo-
   Fordism’, following Palloix (1976), and gives it two principal

```

```
 eres eistice: First, there is the technical hardware already
  mentioned.® Second, there is the ‘recomposition of tasks’ lying
  behind the slogans as job-enrichment or job-rotation. This he sees as
  the consequence of having removed all the heavy manual jobs at one
  end of the scale, and much of the skilled fitting and wasteful direct
  supervision at the other. What remains are bland, interchangeable,
  semi-skilled tasks. The benefit to managements lies in increased
  flexibility in the allocation of task-combinations to individuals, who
  all receive a time-wage rather than any piece-wage. This can
  contribute to solving the ‘balance problems’ of earlier forms of
  mechanisation and also eliminate insufficiently controlled pockets of
  skilled labour or well-organised unskilled labour. It is instructive to
  compare the picture of the engineering operative which emerges from
  this analysis of neo-Fordism with the accounts of the process-
  operator in those parts of the chemical industry which exhibit
  continuous-flow processes (Nichols and Beynon, 1977). The same
  dependency on the machine behind an illusion of skill and judgement
  is suggested, even though the levels of integration of the two pro-
  cesses are different. Neo-Fordism is discussed further in Chapter S.
   The period since World War Two can therefore be summarised as
  having witnessed two major changes in production systems. The first
  which began early on and was to some extent emerging during the
  1930s and the war itself, was a change in the focus of mechanisation
  from transfer to control. The tertiary mechanisation which developed
  in the post-war period added to the maturity of Fordism and to some
  extent resolved the technical bottleneck which had been present in
  the secondary mechanisation stage. But the progress of tertiary
  mechanisation led to a further bottleneck which was present in both
  the technology and the labour organisation aspects of the production
  process, namely the lack of flexibility to cope with small batches and
  therefore, by implication, with product differentiation. The second
  change then is the development of technologies and forms of
  organisation which do possess flexibility. This is the core of what has
  been labelled neo-Fordism. Most agree, however, that this tendency
  is still very much in its infancy. Aglietta, without any reference to
  long wave theories, sees the current recession as linked to the ‘crisis’
  of Fordism, with the ability of neo-Fordism to resolve the situation by
  no means guaranteed. Mandel (1980, p. 45) although without any
  technical elaboration, argues that a change in the organisational form
  of production processes is vital for capital to re-establish sufficient
  profitability to begin a new long upswing. Finally a wide variety of

```

-----

```
   authors who believe that the current recession has some peculiar
    ‘structural’ character to it believe that new technology will be
   somehow implicated in any upswing. There are several suggestions
   then, that long periods in capitalist development are related in some
   way to major changes in the level and character of mechanisation.
   Further elaboration of this issue must await exposition of long wave
   theories in the next chapter.
     It is appropriate at this point to reconsider another technical
   development, often associated with ‘automation’ in the public mind,
    but not considered either by Bell, Aglietta, Bright, Mandel or any
   other of the authors we have so far discussed. The industrial robot,
   perhaps because of its anthropomorphic character, exemplifies the
   popular concept of ‘automation’ more powerfully than do numeri-
    cally controlled machine-tools. The fact that their diffusion and
    technical maturity have accelerated in the past two or three years
    leads to the suspicion that they are involved in some way in the
   developments we have discussed.
    The first interesting fact to note about robots is that their practical
   development was closely linked to that of NC machines. An early
   example was a tool-changing device in a machine tool, and the whole
    technical apparatus of electronic control is broadly similar to NC
    control (Atkinson, 1980, Chap. 5). From the standpoint of Bell’s
   scheme, as used here, a problem arises immediately in that robots are
   engaged both in transformation operations, such as painting and
   welding, and in transfer operations. These two types of robot cannot
    therefore be classified together and have to be discussed separately.
    In order to retain continuity with the previous discussion of
   machining it is useful to discuss transfer robots first.
    Some of these robots, particularly those known as ‘pick-and-place’
   robots, are in fact remarkably unsophisticated by comparison with
    their popular image. While they do represent level 4 in Bell’s
   hierarchy of transfer, Atkinson argues (1980, p. 174) that they only
    lie at level 6 in Bright’s hierarchy of mechanisation (see Figure 2.1).
   Perhaps the simplest way to think of this sort of transfer robot is that
    it is One step up from the rigidity of the handling aspects of a
   conventional Bell level 4 system as in a transfer line. When operating
    it is ‘dedicated’ and ‘hard’. It can only work on one or a small number
    of parts and only make one movement. But it can in principle be
   re-programmed, and re-tooled (in the sense of being given a new
   gripping system) so that it can function with different work-pieces.
   This makes it more flexible than the transfer parts of a transfer line.

```

-----

```
  However, if we jump to levels 16 and 17 of Bright’s chart, levels
  which were not highly populated by examples in his time, we find
  robots now in existence with sensory systems and slightly more
  flexible ‘hands’. These robots can cope with the handling tasks of a
  highly mechanised machining system which has a non-uniform flow of
  varying parts coming through it. It therefore adds a further level of
  handling to Bell’s scheme.
   These robots can now be more clearly situated with respect to the
  earlier discussion. The progressive mechanisation of control func-
  tions currently going on is resolving some problems but is simul-
  taneously exposing the rigidity and incompatibility of existing
  transfer systems. Complex vision and learning algorithms in the next
  generation of handling robots will create new degrees of flexibility in
  handling which will be necessary for the full exploitation of the
  potential of DNC machining. In fact, such combinations are the basis
  of US and Japanese experiments in so-called ‘workerless’ factories. It
  should be added that these experiments also involve the use of two
  related technologies: the central process control computer, which
  controls material and production flow, and the assembling robot,
  which is a similar device to the level 17 transfer robot but with
  different grippers and some ancillary jigs and associated hardware.
   This leads us naturally on to a brief consideration of non-transfer
  robots. One category is the assembly robot, just discussed, the other
  is the transforming robot which does such tasks as painting and welding.
  What distinguishes these transforming robots is the simultaneous
  high-level mechanisation of the transformation [and ][control ] [dimensions ]
  of tasks which had previously been [at ] [the ] [hand-held ] [power ] [tool ]
  level. They therefore represent [quite ] [large ] [jumps ] [in ] [the ] [degree ]
  of mechanisation of these processes. We have already noted that the
  progress of mechanisation [is ]uneven [in ] [various ] [industries ] [and ] [tasks, ]
  with not all parts of the production [process ] [going ] [through ] [the ]
  successive phases of transformation, [transfer ] [and ] [control ] [dominance ]
  in mechanisation. These examples [seem ] [to ] [be ] [laggards ] [which ] [are ]
  being catapulted into a higher level of mechanisation [by ] [the ]
  introduction of a type of [technology ] [which ] [exhibits ] [the ] [new ] [‘holy ]
  grail’ of control mechanisation: flexibility.
   It seems in order, therefore, to add robotics, and large-scale
  computer process control, to the two technological components of
  neo-Fordism outlined earlier. They form a package by virtue of their
  shared emphasis on control and on solving the problems encountered
  in Fordism.

```

```
    This then raises the question of how far the transition to these new
   production systems has proceeded up to now, what factors will
   govern their future diffusion and how long the complete transition it
    will take. The theoretical answers to these questions depend on the
   interpretation of the central issue of the relation of technical change
    to economic development. However, one enabling condition can
   already be noted as severely under-developed. Although the micro-
   electronics components which are at the centre of these new
   technologies are at a reasonable stage of maturity, the sensing,
   actuating and gripping technologies, as well as the software associ-
   ated with them, are still in an early stage of development. While
   technical solutions to these problems may indeed be imminent, we
   can at least be sure that there are not a whole legion of mature
   industrial robots and computer-aided manufacturing systems which
    are now entering their rapid diffusion phase. It seems more realistic
    to characterise them as being in the gently-sloping early part of the
    classic S-shaped diffusion curve, which of course is a difficult portion
   of the curve to extrapolate.
   CONCLUSION
   The initial question posed in this and the last chapter was that of
   identifying ‘automation’ analytically and establishing its historical
   character. After noting the great confusion which has surrounded the
   term in the past, some order was achieved by postulating levels of
   ‘automation’/mechanisation in the manner proposed by Bright. His
   categories however, tend to blur an important distinction, pointed
   out by Bell, between the transformation, transfer and control
   elements of a process. So we have abolished ‘automation’ as an
   analytically useful term and chosen to distinguish between different
   types of mechanisation. We have adopted this scheme, and examined
    its relationship to the Marxist notion of the labour process. This has
   resulted in a view of production technology and work organisation as
   elements of production processes which simultaneously create
   products and profits and maintains the labour-management rela-
   tionship in capitalist societies.
    When set against the history of the changes and conflicts over the
   technical and organisational aspects of production systems, this
   framework has a useful organising power. Although there are any
   number of inter-industry differences and nuances of periodisation,

```

-----

```
 we have argued that the development of mechanisation technologies
 has a discernible structure. Once the basic features of machinofacture
 were established the first phase was the progressive mechanisation of
 transformation processes, using improved power sources, and im-
 proving their integration by means of interchangeable parts. The
 progress of the mechanisation of transformation gradually shifted the
 focus and the inducement mechanism towards transfer functions. The
  linear flow of work-pieces exemplified by Fordism drew on both the
 problems of congestion and the possibilities of systematisation
 created by the previous phase. It also entered into a virtuous circle
 with the expansion of mass-markets for certain consumer items,
  especially in the areas of transport, domestic work and entertain-
 ment.
   Subsequently, the focus shifted again to the dimension of control as
  the incremental improvements in transfer mechanisation yielded
 diminishing returns. In the post-war boom, control mechanisation
 developed substantially, but again a bottleneck was encountered in
  the form of inflexibility. So in the last two decades best-practice
 technologies have increasingly been differentiated from their fore-
  runners by greater flexibility with respect to scale, batch size,
 product-type and skill requirements. The technologies used to
  achieve this flexibility promise to be sufficiently powerful to feed
  back into the mechanisation of transformation and transfer raising
 them to higher levels.
   Overlaid on this sequence of changes in mechanisation technolo-
  gies has been a longer process of transformations in work organisa-
  tion. During the initial progress of secondary mechanisation,
 Taylorism and systematic management were incorporated into
  Fordism. This system of production matured [and ] [prospered ] [in ]
  conjunction with mass consumption, and was fuelled by the
  successful overcoming of the technical problems of secondary
  mechanisation and the shift [to ] [tertiary ] [mechanisation. ] [But ] [the ] [forms ]
  of tertiary mechanisation [installed ] [in ] [production ] [processes ] [since ]
 World War Two proved [insufficiently ] [flexible ] [and ] [became ] [entwined ]
  in the problems of Fordism.
  New technologies, based on micro-electronics and computers, now
 beginning their industrial diffusion, offer much greater flexibility in
  tertiary mechanisation. The significance of this is twofold. One is the
  extension of mechanisation to small-batch production which pre-
  viously had to rely on craft workers using multipurpose machinery to
 make the variety of products associated with batch production. We

```

-----

```
    will show in Chapter 6 that new technologies have major implications
    for the productivity of small-batch sectors. However, a second effect
   of flexible tertiary mechanisation is seen within high volume
   production. Here the flexibility of reprogrammable machine systems
   allows increased mechanisation but with substantial product dif-
   ferentiation. The link between mechanisation and scale begins to
   weaken; hence, the economic importance of new control technolo-
    gies in large volume- but not mass-production industries like
   earth-moving equipment and mid-market furniture. Crucially,
   computer-based control systems have the potential to cheapen the
    cost of capital equipment because of reprogrammability. No longer
   does the machinery on a mass-production line have to be scrapped
   upon a change of model or product. Its economic life can be extended
   by reprogramming, thus increasing the opportunity to amortise the
    cost of this machinery over the life cycle of several production
   periods.”
    We therefore now see the onset of a period in which substantial
   change is imminent in technology and in work organisation. There
    are also important implications for the type of industrial and, as we
    shall show in Chapter 7, service products that will be available from
    these changed production systems. But before we discuss these
   changes we conclude by noting that the periods of change we have
   outlined — our phases of mechanisation — bear a striking similarity to
    the broad structure proposed for long wave interpretations of the
    history of economic growth first mentioned in Chapter 1. This topic is
   one which we wish to pursue. In order to do that we now turn to an
   account and critique of some of these theories.

 4 Mechanisation and Long
  Waves
 INTRODUCTION
 Chapter 1 drew attention to the recent interest in theories of
 long-term economic development which might throw some light on
 the causes of the current economic crisis and on means of solving it.
 Such theories are usually called ‘long wave’ theories.’ There are three
 reasons why we examine long wave theories in this book. First, they
  offer, more than any other body of economic theory, a way of
 examining the historical significance of major technological change.
 Second, the proposed dating of them corresponds at various points to
 our analysis of phases of mechanisation. [Third, ] [they ] [themselves ]
 propose a role for ‘automation’ [which ] [deserves ] [attention, ] [given ] [our ]
 focus on mechanisation.
  The most developed long-wave theories are either Marxist, such as
  that of Mandel (1975) or neo-Schumpeterian, such as those of Van
 Duijn (1983), Mensch (1979) and Freeman et al. (1982). It might be
 prudent to argue, however, that at the present stage of development
  of such a large-scale theoretical structure it would be unwise to
  restrict discussion entirely to any one economic paradigm. This is
  especially true of a situation in which the empirical data which might
  illuminate long-wave theories are very sparse, and open to many
  interpretations. Our approach is close to that described by Freeman
  as ‘reasoned history’ (Freeman et al., 1982, p. ix). In this chapter we
  shall critically discuss the work of Mandel and Freeman, concentrat-
  ing on the way they treat mechanisation in their theories. We have
  two goals: first, we offer some data on the diffusion of mechanisation
  technologies since World War Two which ‘tests’ the model of
 mechanisation development put forward in Chapter 3 and substan-
  tially modifies Mandel’s account of them; second, we suggest how our
 emphasis on mechanisation and labour-process developments contri-
  butes to an understanding of the nature of the lower turning point of
  the long wave.

   MANDEL’S THEORY OF LONG WAVES
   Mandel’s starting-point is the Marxist explanation of the mechanism
    of industrial cycles in capitalism. He poses the question: ‘Is this
    cyclical movement simply repeated every ten, seven, or even five
   years? Or is there a peculiar inner dynamic to the industrial cycles
    over longer periods of time?’ (Mandel, 1975, p. 110). His answer to
    this question is particularly interesting.
    The length of the cycles in Marx’s analysis is determined by the
   duration of the turnover time necessary to replace fixed capital, this
   being something which takes place over a number of successive
   production periods. In the reinvestment phase a portion of the
    surplus created is reinvested, thus increasing the stock of capital and
   constituting what Marx called extended reproduction — the
   accumulation of capital. In the process of reinvestment, individual
    capitalists have to make judgements about the sort of machinery in
   which they should embody their fixed capital. This involves consider-
    ing the relationships between the technological characteristics of
   competing machines and other commercial factors which, taken
    together, determine the costs of production, the levels of output and
   employment, and the profits which might accrue. In a competitive
   environment, enterprises will be attracted to techniques in which ‘the
    saving on paid living labour exceeds the additional costs of the fixed
    capital, or more precisely, the total constant capital’ (Mandel, 1975,
    p. 111). We might rephrase this condition as expressing what could be
    called the need to improve cost efficiency internally, that is, as
   measured with respect to the previous practice of the enterprise.
   Enterprises will also be attracted to those techniques which not only
    save labour but also reduce total production costs in such a way as to
    create an extra margin of profit as compared with other enterprises.
    This second condition expresses the pressure to adopt what conven-
    tional economists would call the ‘best-practice technique’, or to
   innovate — that is, to bring in a new best-practice technique. On
    balance, therefore, reinvestment would involve the use of a ‘higher’
    level of technology and an increase in the organic composition of
    capital which corresponds very roughly to an increase in the capital
    intensity of production.
    Now this model of ‘choice of technique’, which assumes that
    enterprises trust their ability to make accurate cost forecasts,
    implicitly requires a continuous spectrum of techniques to be
    available — continuous in the sense that for each technique there is a

```

```
 nearby one which just slightly alters the calculations of production-
 cost advantage versus capital-cost penalty. Thus, the enterprise will
 be able to optimise (if not maximise) revenues by choosing ‘just the
 right’ technique. In reality, of course, technological possibilities are
 not so well-ordered and Mandel suggests that in general there might
 be two broad types of reorganisation of production open to the
 enterprise during zeinvestment. On the one hand there are relatively
 routine ‘incremental’ changes, where minor improvements are found
 in the new machinery, labour is more efficiently organised and
 perhaps some raw materials are economised or cheapened. On the
 other hand, there may be much more ‘radical’ changes, involving
 completely different machinery and work organisation, new raw
 materials and a ‘fundamental revolution in technology’ (Mandel,
 1975, p. 112).?
   While it is plausible to construct such a scenario of technical
  possibilities, the problem remains of how the choice is made in
 practice and what enabling circumstances are necessary to realise
 each of the alternatives. Mandel suggests a mechanism for this
 process with two components. First, he argues that in the course of a
 normal short industrial cycle the total mass of surplus-value
 generated over the course of the (approximately) ten-year period
 exceeds the sum of the surplus consumed by capitalists and reinvested
  in circulating capital, by some increment, which is available for new
 fixed capital formation. But the increment associated with one short
 cycle is unlikely to be adequate to create the new production sites for
 the manufacture of those radically new machines which will be
 involved in his ‘fundamental technological revolution’. Thus, says
 Mandel, the increments of a succession of short cycles are incom-
 pletely invested, and an historical reserve fund of capital is generated
 which eventually can, ‘at the appropriate time’, provide the means
  for the additional accumulation of capital which is entailed when
 extended reproduction occurs in the context of a ‘fundamental
 renewal of production technology’ (Mandel, 1975, p. 114).
  The determination of the ‘appropriate time’ is the second
 component of the mechanism. If a component of total social capital
 has been lying ‘idle’ for a period, this is probably because it could not
 be invested earlier at an adequate return. Reinvestment then
 proceeds when an adequate rate of profit looks possible. The
 accelerated accumulation of the upswing of a long wave therefore
 depends upon the appearance of factors which create an increase in
 the social average rate of profit, beyond that which occurs as a

    natural fluctuation in the short cycle. Under these circumstances the
    under-invested capital of the preceding succession of short cycles can
    be channelled into the creation of the new branches of production
   which furnish the capital goods characteristic of the fundamental
   revolution in productive technology.*
    Mandel suggests some factors which might enable such a sustained
    increase in the rate of profit to occur. These are:
    1. a sudden fall in the ‘average organic composition of capital’ which
     might be seen also as an increase in capital productivity (cf. Soete
     and Dosi, 1983);
    2. a sudden rise in the ‘rate of surplus-value’ as a result, for example,
     of a radical defeat of the working class which lowers the rate of
     wage rises even in a period of economic prosperity;
    3. a sudden fall in the price of the elements of constant capital,
     especially of raw materials, which has the same effect as (1) above;
    4. a sudden abbreviation of the turn-over time of circulating capital
     because of the perfection of new systems of transport and
     communications, improved methds of distribution, accelerated
     rotation of stock and so on (Mandel, 1975, p. 115).
    Mandel sees a need for several of these ‘trigger factors’ to be
    coincident if the increase in the rate of profit is to be sustained, and
    not damped in a short time-span by a flow of capital into the new
    areas. This is an interesting part of Mandel’s analysis. He insists that
    the trigger factors are relatively autonomous and not entirely
   dependent on the pre-conditioning of the downswing of a previous
    long wave. They are in many senses historically contingent factors
    which, while related to the economic circumstances of present and
    preceding periods, are nevertheless related in a very mediated way.
   He therefore attempts to straddle the ground of a traditional
    long-wave debate which began in the 1920s, in the USSR, between
    Trotsky and one of the first long-wave theorists, Kondratiev, over the
    role of endogenous and exogenous factors, between ‘wave’ and
    ‘cycle’ (see Day, 1981). Mandel sees the response of the capitalist
    system to major stimuli as law-bound and cyclical but the stimuli
    themselves are not necessarily regular in occurrence and therefore
    the cycles appear not as regular cycles but as less regular waves.* To
    underline this historical specificity of the trigger factors, Mandel gives
    a brief outline of what he believes them to be for the upswings of
    1850, 1894 and 1945. These are summarised together with analysis of
   movements in the rate of profit, components of capital etc. in Table 4.1.

```

-----

```
  We can therefore characterise Mandel’s theory as a modified
  capital accumulation model. Long waves are seen as alternating
 periods of accelerated (upswings) and decelerated (downswings)
 accumulation of capital in which the facts of acceleration and
 deceleration are the result of the dynamics of a competitive economy
 given certain boundary conditions. The timing of the turning points,
 however, is the result of the interplay between the rate of profit and
  the gestation periods of fundamental innovations, both in technolo-
  gical and money terms. Recently however, Mandel (1980, 1981) has
 placed more emphasis on the relatively autonomous role of class
 struggle in the determination of the lower turning point.
  Mandel sees the ‘revolutions in technology’ mentioned above as
  having some broad structural features in common with each other, in
  that they are concerned with the technologies of motive power. Thus
 the three technological revolutions experienced since the middle of
 the nineteenth century are summarised as:
  Machine production of steam-driven motors since 1848; machine
  production of electric and combustion motors since the 90s of the
  nineteenth century; machine production of electronic and nuclear-
  powered apparatuses since the 40s of the twentieth century.
  (Mandel, 1975, p. 118)
  The upswing of each long wave is characterised by the establish-
 ment of the new production sites and new industries, responsible for
 the production of the new capital goods. This is the activity which
 absorbs the previously idle capital, giving a stimulus to accumulation.
 The downswing is characterised by stabilisation of the new sectors
 coupled with the gradual generalisation of their products, the new
 capital goods, into many sectors of industry. With the removal of the
 dynamic impetus of new capital formation in the capital goods sector,
 the economy as a whole moves to a phase of decelerated accumula-
 tion. Clearly, if the new capital goods are relatively labour-
 displacing, then their application, without the counterbalancing
 formation of new capital in the capital goods sector, will lead to
 unemployment in aggregate, without changes in the distribution of
 wealth, thus compounding a slow-down in economic growth. This
 aspect of the wave is however dealt with more effectively: by Freeman
 and we will return to it.
  Mandel’s theory of long-term economic development thus empha-
 sises technical change in the capital goods sector as being a very

```
    significant factor. Two other long-wave theories also consider
    technical change. First, there are the ‘innovation-clustering’ theories
    of Mensch (1979), Kleinknecht (198la, 1981b), and van Duijn
    (1983). Second, there are the theories which emphasise the clustering
    of particular, and particularly important, technological innovations
   which form ‘New Technology Systems’ and generate a collection of
   new-industry life cycles, or which ‘rejuvenate’ older, mature indus-
    tries. Freeman (1977), Freeman et al. (1982) and, to a lesser extent,
    van Duijn fall into this category. We can now consider each of these
    in turn and examine their interactions with the theory of labour
    process changes developed in Chapters 2 and 3. One of the features
    of comparison between the theories which we wish to stress is the
    relative weight they place on the role of product versus process
    innovations in their explanation of the ups and downs of the long
    waves.
   THEORIES OF THE CLUSTERING OF TECHNOLOGICAL
   INNOVATIONS
   Mensch takes as his principal focus the clustering of basic innovations
    and tries to establish it as a documented and statistically verified
   phenomenon. Thus a large part of his work is devoted to tables and
    charts with his estimates of the dates of inventions and innovations.
   From this Mensch invokes elements of Schumpeter’s economic
    analysis and explains the great depressions of economic history as
    points of ‘technological stalemates’ when the industries created by
    basic innovations have run out of steam, no longer stimulating the
   economy as a whole. The process of running out of steam has its
    technological counterpart in the stream of incremental improvement
    innovations which follow radical innovations. The stream of improve-
    ment innovations coincides with the evolution of the relevant
    industry along the path of the product’s life-cycle.°
    Mensch does not believe that this process is the result of any
    discontinuity in the availability of basic inventions to be innovated,
    although he criticises business practice for neglecting investment in
    research and development in such a way as to reduce inventive as well
    as innovative possibilities. He uses his statistical samples and
    techniques to argue that the basic inventions are much more equally
    distributed in time than are the innovations (Mensch, 1979, p. 148).
   There is some gentle clustering but only as a reflection of very

```

-----

```
  long-lived changes in basic scientific theory. He sees the clustering of
  innovation as resulting from a compression of the invention—
  innovation lead-times as a result of the pressures of the recession.
   This view of industrial development — inventions continuously
  generated, innovations clustering — bears a close resemblance to that
  of Schumpeter. The burden of economic growth-stimulating innova-
  tion falls upon the activities and perceptions of individuals and
  particularly upon individual entrepreneurs. Around the upper
  turning point, the product differentiation, planned obsolescence and
 gimmicky competition of mature consumer-goods industries play a
  part in the stagnation of demand by producing dissatisfaction
 amongst consumers. During this period, Mensch argues, consumers
  are reaching towards new demands which the supply side cannot
  satisfy thus compounding depression. Delbeke (1981) has correctly
  pointed out that this emphasis on demand saturation is a feature not
  given such prominence in other long-wave theories.
   Thus, for Mensch, the downswing of a long wave is best seen as an
  innovation ‘bottleneck’. In the last resort, entrepreneurs adopt new
  basic innovations because it is the only alternative left, save complete
 commercial suicide through pursuing a product line which is
 completely stagnant. We shall see later that this view of the effects of
  recession on technical change is dubious theoretically and not yet
  empirically proven. Mensch’s work is therefore more useful in its
  - emphasis on the role of product technology in upswings than in its
  analysis of turning-points. Further work on clustering by Mensch and
  other authors (Kleinknecht, 1981a, 1981b; van Duijn, 1983) has been
  useful in clarifying the debate, but we are more convinced by
 Freeman’s treatment of this problem and it is that to which we now
  turn.
 ‘NEW TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS’ THEORIES
 The work of Freeman and his colleagues is written in the context of
 the debates over structural unemployment, and attempts to explain
 that phenomenon as intrinsic to the downswing of a long wave,
 arguing that this is the case in the last part of the twentieth century.
 Freeman’s starting point is Kuznets’ request for a clear statement of
 the relationship between the rate of introduction of a major
 innovation and the upswing of the long wave. He argues that what is
 necessary is to investigate the possibility that:

     (the) early phase of the introduction of major new technologies
    might tip the balance of economic development in an expansionary
     ‘full employment’ direction, whilst later phases of the exploitation
     of these same new technologies might tend to shift the balance in
     the opposite direction (Freeman, 1977, p. 7).
     Whilst acknowledging the stimulus of Mensch’s work on the
   cataloguing of innovations, Freeman prefers to concentrate on a very
   few fundamental changes in technology which embrace a large cluster
    of associated or dependent specific innovations, called New Tech-
   nology Systems (NTS). Freeman feels that in the post-World War
   Two period electronics and synthetic materials can be seen as such
   systems. Whilst he does not wish to propose that such major
   technological changes be regarded as the single cause of the long
   waves, he clearly feels that at least some of them would be likely to be
   synchronised into the waves by virtue of their structural interactions
   with the economic system. In order to have the profound effects on
    the economy which the theory suggests, they are most likely to be
   associated with the machinery industries, transport, energy and
   communications.
    A model is developed which attempts to show how the sequence of
   events in research, development, design, application, marketing and
   employment effects of an NTS might be logically ‘fitted’ into the
   long-wave schema. A version of this schema is shown in Table 4.2
   and can be summarised as follows:
    1. Major new technologies begin to appear throughout the wave
     preceding the one in which they boom.
     to . In the upswing, the new technologies establish new branches of
     industry which exert a demand-—pull stimulation on supplying
     industries and which contribute ‘spin-off’ applications which are
     taken up by these industries. Relative prices of the new goods fall
     rapidly.
    3. The effect of (2) on employment is to create new jobs in new and
     closely connected industries. Skill shortages and full employment
     allow wage-rates to rise, creating inflation and long-term pressure
     to adopt more labour-saving techniques.
    4. This employment-generating effect dwindles as the growth rates of
     the new branches subside and the focus on rationalisation
     develops. This stimulus to the whole economy therefore subsides
     also.

```

-----

```
  5. Any labour-displacing potential of the new technologies is seized
   upon and utilised fully in the downswing, thus exacerbating
   demand-deficiency type constraints on economic growth.°
   In some respects this model is not inconsistent with Mandel’s if we
  abstract from the Marxist conceptual structure of value categories.
  But there is a major difference in that Mandel sees ‘automation
  goods’ as the major innovations of the current wave, while Freeman
  emphasises a general trend toward labour-saving in all downswings
  and sees other innovations as the impetus to upswing. A second
  difference is Freeman’s emphasis on the labour market as a source of
  ‘stickiness’ helping to generate the disequilibrium of the long wave.
  We will now examine more closely the difference between the
  arguments of Freeman and the clustering theory of Mensch.
   Freeman has criticised the data, their interpretation, and the
  theoretical basis upon which Mensch bases the notion of a ‘depres-
  sion trigger’ to innovation. He does, however, strongly believe that
  basic and fundamental innovations exhibit clustering, and with his
  colleagues has substantiated this with patent and invention data
  (Clark et al., 1981). But in their view the clusters are not necessarily
  located in the depression phases of long waves, as Mensch believes.
  Nor do they find any evidence of increased attempts at innovation in
  a depression; rather they argue that R & D in these circumstances
  tends to be curtailed.
   Freeman’s explanation of the long wave turns not on the clustering
  of the innovations but on the clustering of the diffusion processes of
  the technically related products and processes of the new technology
  system. In fact, the timing of the actual innovations is pushed to the
  fringes of the picture in a classically Schumpeterian manner. They are
  not entirely exogenous, but they are certainly more contingent and
  not linked in a formal manner to the long wave. The approach is to
  create a model of the possibility of new sectors being created by a
  family of innovations entering their diffusion curves in a related way.
  The evolution of such a phenomenon is then traced using historical
  evidence to illustrate and substantiate the model. Finally, the
  macro-economic upswing is deduced [as ] [a ] [potential ] [corollary ] [as ] [is ][its ]
  upper turning-point and the [character ] [of ] [the ] [recessionary ] [period. ]
  This leaves one big gap. The [moment ] [and ] [nature ] [of ] [the ] [lower ]
  turning-point is not included [in ][the ] [model. ] [Freeman ] [clearly ] [feels ] [that ]
  socio-political factors are important [at ] [this ] [point ] [but ] [he ] [does ] [not ]
  elaborate on this.

```
    So what is the general sequence of events over the course of a long
   wave? First, a number of basic innovations enter the beginning of
    their diffusion. Eventually this creates the need for new manufactur-
   ing processes and so demand and innovative activity in relation to the
    capital goods sector are increased. Productivity growth, market
   growth and, as with Schmookler (1966), demand-led innovation now
   become prominent features of the sector in the rapid growth phase.
   Eventually, however, labour shortages, cost pressures and increasing
   competition generate a bias in process change towards labour-saving.
   With the onset of recession, the absence of new product innovation
   and the further increased pressure on costs pushes the bias further
   toward labour-saving technical change. R & D is likely to concentrate
    on such innovations during this period.
     This scheme suggests that the pressures to alter the technical and
    organisational aspects of the production process will be of two types.
    In the upswing, according to Freeman, new production processes will
    be created in new (and in existing) sectors in conditions where
   potential labour resistance is either bought out, turning into
    inflationary pressure, or else is alleviated by other aspects of
   macro-economic growth. In the downswing the picture is quite
    different. Despite the existence of a labour surplus, technical and
   organisational change will be intensified in order to reduce costs
    further and reshape both jobs and processes to meet the perceived
   needs of managements in search of productivity and quality
   improvements. This aspect of Freeman’s account has features in
   common with the picture of successive periods of intensified labour
   process conflict which have been described in Chapter 3.
    The broader socio-political nature of the factors affecting change in
    the downswing is acknowledged by Freeman. He points out that
   while disagreeing with Mensch’s notion of the depression trigger
   phenomenon, he believes that the extremes of social distress and
    conflict possible in the downswing could cause an ‘indirect’
   depression-trigger phenomenon. In the light of our analysis we can
   elaborate this view. The barriers to radical change in production can
   be lowered by the desire to break the log-jam in the economy at a
    social or political level. Clearly, there are some forms of labour
   process change which are facilitated by political change as was shown
   starkly in the German economy under Nazi rule, and in different
   ways in the wartime economies of the allied countries.
    Indeed the role of World War Two in the lower turning-point of
   the most recent long wave is clearly so dominant that Freeman, with

```

 good reason, finds it difficult to suggest any more mechanistic or
 purely economic structure to the turning-point. The influence of
 rearmament was important from the mid-1930s onwards. In the
 presence of such an overwhelmingly socio-political and contingent
 feature as a world war it is a brave theorist who insists on primacy for
 some underlying economic movement in explaining two decades of
 movement out of, depression into prosperity. Nevertheless, the war
 was clearly connected to the broader circumstances which Freeman
 cites as possible components of an ‘indirect depression-trigger’ effect
 on technical change. It seems uncontroversial to point out that there
 was a connection, if complex, beween the political trends which were
 important in the eventual collapse into war and the class conflicts
 resulting from the economic circumstances of the 1902s and 1930s.
 That these conflicts had a component which centred on the manner of
 the functioning of production processes also seems plausible.
  The basic issue at stake is the rigidity or contingency of the
 economic fluctuations. At one extreme is the view that there is some
 natural necessity to the long-wave phenomenon. At the other
 extreme it is possible to formulate a picture in which the socio-
 political dimensions of the depression so confuse and override any
 pure economic or technical relationships that we are placed firmly in
 the field of contingent history where outcomes of complex situations
 are not predetermined. This dispute is the same one which has always
 been at the centre of the discussion of long waves: do the long waves
 behave as cycles, or as successive periods which have sufficiently
 different characteristics to make it impossible to regard them
  as cycles? We have made our position on this point clear earlier.
 The long wave is relatively ‘law-bound’ once an upswing is under
 way, but the factors which precipitate an upswing are not solely
 economic.
  We cannot resolve this dispute here. What we have emphasised is
 the likelihood of a connection between production-process change
 and long waves. The focus of this connection is at the lower
 turning-point, which is the most incomplete part of the long-wave
 theory. All recent writers are agreed that political and institutional
 changes are the key to the initiation of an upswing with techological
 change as a further condition which is necessary but not sufficient.
 Gordon, Edwards and Reich (1982) for example, have attempted to
 document the institutional change at lower turning-points of long
 waves in the USA (and we return to their arguments in Chapter 8).
 Perez has argued that:

```

-----

```
     The structural crisis thus brought about is then, not only a process
     of ‘creative destruction’ or ‘abnormal liquidation’ in the economic
     sphere, but also in the social-institutional. In fact, the crisis forces
     the restructuring of the socio-institutional framework with innova-
     tions that are complementary to the newly-attained technological
     style or best practice frontier. The final turn the structure will take,
     from the wide range of the possible, and the time span within which
     the transformation is effected to permit a new expansionary phase
      will, however, ultimately depend upon the interests, actions,
     lucidity and relative strength of the social forces at play. (Perez,
     1983, p. 8)
     Freeman (1983b) has shown that Keynes, despite having no
    particular view of long waves, agreed with Schumpeter that major
    surges of investment would be fundamentally conditioned by the
    combination of technical opportunities and investors’ profit expecta-
    tions. All these writers then, tend to converge on the expectations of
    the rate of profit, and its political determinants, as the barometer of
    the lower turning-point, thus adding further substance to the
    argument of Mandel on this point. We suggest that transitions
    between phases of mechanisation have also been intertwined with the
    volatile combination of events in the downswing and lower turning-
    points. The conflict over how production processes should be
    organised, if resolved, can make a significant contribution to the
    formation of profit expectations. The resolution may be primarily
    technological or organisational or, more likely, some combination of
    the two. In the last three lower turning points the combinations have
    been different, but mechanisation regimes have been significant
    contributors.
     Thus we conclude that while the role of technological change in
    products may be adequately explained in Freeman’s framework, the
    role attributed to it in process change is too passive. In Mandel’s
    framework product change is ignored and process change is
    inaccurately specified. The problem comes down to his understand-
    ing of ‘automation’. In the rest of this chapter we seek to put this
    right.
   ‘AUTOMATION’ AND THE POST-WAR BOOM: SOME DATA
     It was noted earlier that Mandel’s account of technological revolu-

```

-----

```
 tions in production places ‘automation’ at the centrepiece of that
 revolution associated with the post-1945 upswing. There are several
 problems with this view. Perhaps the most important is that Mandel
 has no real explanation of why that particular collection of
 innovations should take place at that time. While he gives some
 account of pressure on the demand side, in the form of intensified
 competition over unit costs, he has nothing to say on the supply side.
 He makes no comment on what specifically where the obstacles to
 increased productivity with previous techniques, or whence the new
 techniques came. It is this problem which we wish to resolve.
  Mandel defines ‘automation’, following Rezler (1969), as the
 application of continuous-flow production methods, the automatic
 transfer of parts between successive production processes, and
 computer or electronic control of processes. Needless to say, these
 three principles are often found combined in practice. Mandel gives
 only anecdotal evidence as to the increasing use of these techniques
 in the 1950s and 1960s. This definition of ‘automation’ is marked by
 the inadequacies of all the other definitions which were proposed in
 the debates of the 1960s. It attempts to combine the transfer and the
 control dimensions of mechanisation and is confused as a result.
 While it is accurate to say that continuous flow, mechanical handling
 and electronic control were diffusing in the post-war period, they
 were not doing so at the same rate nor for the same reasons.
   This can be demonstrated by an analysis of Census of Production
 data collected by the governments of both the USA and Britain at
 various intervals. These unique and vastly complex surveys are the
 only direct, disaggregated source of data on what is actually made in
 the economy. In particular, the Censuses list the values of output for
 each category of product for each Census year. Each category of
 product in the ‘machinery’ sectors can be examined in turn to make
 some judgement on whether or not it might constitute an element of
 the process of increasing ‘automation’ alleged to have been taking
 place during this period. How can this decision be made? We have
 used two interrelated sets of criteria.
  The first set of criteria is that of Bell’s axes of transformation,
 transfer and control. In Chapter 3, ‘automation’ as a general historic
 phenomenon was presented as a progression in which each of these
 dimensions of mechanisation had been successively brought into play
 in leading sectors. In different industries however this progression
 has followed a different pattern and moves at different rates. On
 examining a wide variety of machinery, at least some of which is

```

-----

```
    tailored to specific customer industries, we may expect to find
    revealed different patterns of the balance of transformation, transfer
    and control mechanisation.
     The second set of criteria is more specific to the post-war period.
    Earlier in this chapter it was established that Mandel’s use of
    mechanical handling, continuous-flow principles and electronic
    control, despite not being based on any theory of ‘automation’
    accurately captured the fact that, in this period, ‘automation’
    consisted of mature transfer mechanisation being reinforced by
    nascent control mechanisation. Since these categories are couched in
     a more directly technological language, it should be possible and
    appropriate to search for explicit examples of these types of hardware
     in sorting through the Census categories.
     These two sets of criteria can therefore be used to structure the
    production of post-war machinery industries into a pattern which
    helps to evaluate the general model of mechanisation put forward in
    Chapter 3 and how it links into long-wave theories. (The potential
     pitfalls in this procedure and inadequacies in the data themselves are
    discussed elsewhere.)’
     The task is, therefore, to sort the various types of machinery in the
    US and UK Production Censuses — and there are more than sixty
    major types, each with multiple subdivisions — into one of five
     categories:
     @ mechanical handling equipment (for example, conveyor belts)
     ® continuous-flow process equipment (for example, chemical plant)
     @ control technologies (for example, process-control electronics)
      e@ hard/dedicated ‘automation’ technologies (for example, cigarette-
     making machinery)
     @ none of the above four
    The totals in terms of value of machinery produced in the Census
     years, for each of the first four categories, are then expressed as a
    proportion of the total value of machinery in that year. The results of
     this analysis are presented in Tables 4.3 and 4.4 and in Figures 4.1
    and 4.2.
     One can see from Table 4.3 that, for the USA, mechanical
    handling increases from 3.6 to 6.1 per cent of the total machinery
    produced between 1947 and 1972. Hard ‘automation’ increases from
     0.6 to 2.4 per cent. Continuous-flow machinery remains, proportion-
     ately, fairly constant going from 6.6 to 6.9 per cent. Control
    technologies, however, show a large rise from 3.4 to 16.2 per cent.

    This rise is particularly concentrated between 1958 and 1963. For
    Britain the picture is quite similar to that of the USA. From 1954 to
    1979 hard ‘automation’ shows a gradual increase from 1.8 to 2.8 per
    cent. Mechanical handling shows a more substantial increase from 2.9
    to 8.4 per cent; continuous-flow technologies which were stable in the

 Figure 4.2. Control and transfer machinery production in UK, 1954-79
  Summing all the ‘automation’ categories as a fraction of all
 machinery produced gives us a gross indicator of the answer to the
 dubiously significant question “how much automation has there been
 since the war?’. These data are presented in Figures 4.1 and 4.2 and it
 can be seen that the curves for both the USA and Britain have a
 characteristic S-shape and rise from around 14 per cent of all
 machinery in 1947 to around 31 per cent in 1972 for the USA and 16
 per cent in 1954 to 32 per cent in 1979 for Britain. It is important here
  to point out some of the factors which qualify these data and their
 interpretation. There is likely to be systematic under-representation

```

-----

```
    of so-called automated equipment in the census throughout the
    period because of the incorporation of non-automated individual
    machines into custom-built automated systems by purchasers or their
    agents; this under-representation is likely to be more pronounced in
    the earlier phase. On the other hand, the relative price of that
    automated equipment which is reported in the earlier stages will be
    higher than average because of the absence of economies of scale.
    These two sources of error work in opposite directions on the early
    part of the curve; although there is no way of knowing to what extent,
     if at all, they balance out. Nevertheless, the movement from 14 to 31
    per cent and 16 to 32 per cent over twenty-five years is so large that it
    is unlikely to be artefact or chance. It seems reasonable to regard
    these data as the indicator of the relative weight of secondary and
    tertiary machines in the product structure of the capital goods
    industries. Furthermore, the data seem to conform, in general, to the
    proposed upswing of the long wave, though the details of this possible
    interrelation will be discussed later.
     The second, more complex, thing which can be done with these
    data is to try to disaggregate them into two components which reflect
    our earlier theoretical discussions of transfer mechanisation and
    control mechanisation. This can be done as follows: mechanical
    handling and continuous flow can be treated as comprising transfer
    mechanisation. Control technologies and hard ‘automation’ can be
    seen as tertiary mechanisation. As has already been established,
    tertiary mechanisation is quite distinct from transfer mechanisation.
     Its empirical distinction lies in the fact that a variety of types of
    electronic control equipment can be associated with a given
    production system. While it is true that in real technical change the
    new equipment will often incorporate an improvement in transfer
    and control mechanisation simultaneously, it is also true that the
    control feature can be modified autonomously. It is this relative
    independence in both conceptual and technological terms which
    makes control goods valid as a separate indicator from transfer
    mechanisation goods. Accordingly, in Figures 4.1 and 4.2, transfer
    and control are shown as two separate components of the time trend
    of total ‘automation’ goods. It is clear that the trends are quite
    different from one another. The transfer mechanisation trend is quite
    gentle from 10.2 per cent in 1947 to 13.0 per cent in 1972 for the
    USA, and from 13.4 per cent in 1954 to 15.4 per cent in 1979 for
    Britain; whereas the tertiary trend is quite sharply rising from 4.0 to
    18.6 per cent for the USA and 2.5 to 16.9 per cent for Britain.

```
  Some general observations can now be made on both the US and
 UK data. First, they are remarkably similar in overall character, both
  in terms of gross aspect and detail. This is certainly to be expected to
 some extent since we have attempted to be as near consistent as
 possible in the choice of categories to assemble the various subtotals.
 This suggests that it is reasonable to assume that the historical
 development of mechanisation has been broadly similar in the output
  of the machinery industries of the two countries. There are also some
  significant differences however. The UK transfer mechanisation
 trend is higher than that of the USA over the overlap period from
  1954 to 1972. It is rather doubtful whether any significance can be
 attached to this difference since it is quite small and is broadly
 accounted for by slight differences in the coverage of the category in
  the two sets of data brought about by the dissimilar Industrial
  Classification schemes. In fact, it is likely that any systematic errors in
  the data will influence equally the absolute value of the percentages
  in all years rather than the rate of change with respect to time. It is,
  perhaps, more interesting when looking at the two ‘control’ curves to
  note the slope of the steep-rise portions, rather than the fact that the
 US one is higher than the UK one. Since these technologies are the
  ones that are diffusing rapidly over the study period, it is important to
  note that diffusion seems to have accelerated earlier in the USA than
  Britain. This judgement must be qualified by the fact that the Census
  category changes, referred to earlier, may have occurred at different
  rates in the two countries. On inspection it transpires that a separate
  Census category for computers — a dominant element of the control
  subtotal — was introduced in the UK in 1958, whilst in the USA the
  category appears in 1963. This would bias the data in the opposite
  direction to that observed and suggest that the observed diffusion
  lead of the USA in all control technologies is real and not an artefact.
   There is also a significant difference between the two countries’
  Control and Total curves in the latter part of the time period. The US
  curves show evidence of retardation of growth of secondary and
  tertiary mechanisations’ share of machinery output from 1963 but
  we have no data beyond 1972. In the British case, the retardation
 comes in 1972 but recovers by 1979. The significance of this is
  not clear.
   Nevertheless the data seem to support the hypothesis advanced
  earlier; the immediate progress of ‘automation’ since World War
 Two has not been one undifferentiated process, but rather the sum of
  two distinct trends. The first trend is the ‘mature’ phase of the

```

-----

```
    diffusion of transfer mechanisation and the second trend is the early
    stage of diffusion of control mechanisation.
   CONCLUSION
   We have seen that, for the post-war period at least, the data give
    support to our analysis of phases of mechanisation. Our intention is
    to incorporate this dimension of technical change into the long-wave
    model which results from combining Freeman’s views on New
   Technology Systems and product change with Mandel’s views on the
    role of political factors in influencing profit expectations. Mandel’s
    analysis does briefly mention changes in the production process
    which might occur in the long wave. As part of his emphasis on the
    relative autonomy of class struggle and its role in the unpredictability
    of the resolution of the depression, he observes that the depressions
    are periods of class conflict over the ‘method of organisation of
    labour’:
    What we want to stress is not so much the consequences as the
     origins of revolutionary transformations of the labour process. In
     our opinion they originate from attempts by capital to break down
     growing obstacles to a further increase in the rate of surplus value
     during the preceding period. Then, again, the direct connection is
     established with the rhythmic long-term movement of capital
     accumulation and the increasing (or decreasing) push toward
     radical changes in labour organisation. (Mandel, 1980, p. 43)
     He further argues that Taylorism was a response to the control
    over the labour process enjoyed by craft workers, and he sees the
    ‘third technological revolution’ (automation) as a response to the
    ability of workers to impose some control on the conveyor-belt
    production systems which became widespread from the inter-war
    period onwards.
     In the light of the data and the arguments above it is clear that
   Mandel has been too casual in assuming that his ‘technological
    revolutions’ and his brief judgements on the history of the labour
    process mesh together quite as readily as he suggests. In the post-war
    period the technologies which Mandel cites as ‘automation’ and part
    of the ‘third technological revolution’ are not, as he suggests, one
    coherent trend. Nor do they owe their origin entirely to attempts to
    erode workers’ control in Taylorised post-craft processes. In fact, this
    cluster of ‘automation’ technologies contains two components. One

```

-----

```
  component is the mature diffusion phase of secondary mechanisation
  technologies of the transfer type. The other component is the initial,
  rapid growth rate of the diffusion of tertiary mechanisation technolo-
  gies concerned with control in the narrow technical sense. This
  overlapping of two sets of diffusion processes is the real substance of
  the capital goods industry expansion which characterises the upswing.
   We therefore’ propose a new component to add to the views of
  Mandel and the view of Freeman on the possibility of an ‘indirect
  trigger’ mechanism in the depression. Our analysis suggests that the
  depression facilitates a shift from an old ‘production regime’ to a new
  one. However, we propose only a shift in the relative inducements
  and costs of radical innovations in production processes rather than a
  necessary flow of such innovations. It is important to recognise the
  unpredictability and serendipity in the flow of particular technical
  solutions to the perceived production problems which are highlighted
  in a depression.® It also follows that the capital goods sector of the
  economy is a significant economic indicator at the lower turning point
  of the long wave. Evidence on profit rates and value added in the
  capital goods industries has shown that an upturn in business
  expectations in this sector may well be a leading indicator of the
  long-wave upturn (Coombs, 1981).
   Although the conditions which stimulate a shift in production
  methods intensify in the depression, the diffusion of new techniques,
  and some of the related secondary innovations, are concentrated in
  the subsequent upswing. The data given illustrate this point. The
  diffusion of new process innovations was rapid in the post-war
  upswing. Further, it shows that some innovations, notably those
  concerned with tertiary mechanisation, were beginning their diffu-
  sion almost from zero in the late 1950s and early 1960s, suggesting
  that some of these innovations themselves were post-war.
   The core of our argument then is that a key factor in any
  explanation of what happens at the lower turning-point of the long
  wave is what production-process changes are underway, such changes
  being entwined with the broader political and institutional changes to
  which long-wave theorists have referred. The production-process
  changes will be of a technological and work-organisational kind, the
  technological ones being framed by the pattern of mechanisation
  developments through the various phases we have described. All the
  long-wave theories except for that of Mandel tend to relegate process
  innovation to the role of a secondary, derived feature. Essentially
  they regard process innovations as contingent on the dynamics of new

```

-----

```
   industry or product life cycles. Freeman does include the possibility
    that the macro-economic influence of inflationary pressure via the
   labour market may induce labour-saving technical change but does
    not make this a major feature of an analysis of the whole wave, only
   of the upswing and the upper turning-point. Mandel does make
   process innovation a more central feature of his theory, but no theory
   of changing demand for process innovations is presented; this is only
   added in the later adjustments and then in a rather incomplete way.
   For Mandel, technological revolutions are still essentially secondary
    features. They act as carriers for economic forces unleashed under
    the stimulus of long-term shifts in the rate of profit.
    By examining the features of the development of production
   processes and their impact on the potential demand for radical
   process innovations, this chapter has suggested a more subtle, and
   perhaps more important, role for such process innovations. We need
    not be forced into choosing to regard process innovations and their
    diffusion periods as either secondary aspects of a prosperity period or
    as serendipitous channels of expansion for the capital goods industry.
    Instead, changes in production processes as expressed through
   technological innovation in the capital goods industry have an
    intrinsic dynamic which is linked into the long-wave mechanism. This
    link is seen as the micro-economic level in the development of new
   product sectors and at the macro-economic level through the medium
    of national labour markets and class struggles.
     It should be noted that there is no necessary connection in the view
   outlined here between the technological principles of production
   process innovations present in a wave and the technological
   principles present in the product innovations which may be important
   growth centres of an upswing. It is however interesting to observe
   empirically that there does seem to be some degree of overlap
   between the technologies. Take for example the dual role of
   electronics in products and processes in the current long wave. This
   point is one which tends to reinforce the insistence of Freeman on the
   importance of new technological systems, as distinct from particular
   individual innovations in the generation of the upswing.
    The contribution of the argument developed here is our defence of
    an induced character of much technical change in the production
   process in the depression and a knock-on effect of this into the
   upswing. This contrasts with Freeman’s view, which tends to restrict
   demand influences on innovation to explain the upswing, and insists
    that Schumpeter-like processes dominate innovation in the depres-

  sion. It contrasts also with Mandel who, until recently, has not seen
  the origins of the technological revolutions as problematic and has
  therefore been crudely Schumpeterian on this point by default. Both
  authors for different reasons struggle to emphasise serendipity (either
  of science or of politics) at the lower turning-point. Our analysis does
  not disagree in principle but in degree. The process technical changes
  of the depression are not entirely random in origin or content, but are
  part of an intelligible sequence of phases of mechanisation of which
  control has been the most recent. We are not however suggesting that
  these phases are in any way prime movers for the long-wave
  mechanism. Nor are we able to suggest how these changes do or do
  not synchronise with the product technical changes which other
  long-wave theorists choose to emphasise.
   The chronology of the phases of mechanisation is summarised in
  Table 4.5. The last entry in that table reminds us of the discussion of
  Fordism in Chapter 3 where we argued that the inflexibilities of its
  production technologies and forms of organisation are now becoming
  a serious bottleneck. We can now see that this bottleneck coincides
  with the downswing of the current long wave. This chapter then
  suggests not only a general result concerning long waves and
  mechanisation but also a specific one. The proposed emergence of
  neo-Fordism is a potential component of the lower turning-point of
  the current long wave. Future chapters are therefore devoted to
  analysing neo-Fordism in more detail.

 5 New Technology and
   Neo-Fordism
   INTRODUCTION
    In Chapter 3 we considered the central role of Fordism in the
   post-war upswing. Fordism, characterised by a technological para-
   digm of the high-volume production of standardised products, gained
    its efficiency by means of an acute division of labour along with the
    use of specialised machinery ‘dedicated’ to the production of long
    runs. But as we and others have argued, with increasing competition
   between firms, the effects of the generalisation of collective
   bargaining on wage costs and limitations to the exploitation of
   economies of scale, the potential for further extension and deepening
    of Fordism, at least within developed countries, has progressively
   diminished.
    Continual spates of mergers and ‘rationalisation’ of plant and
   product ranges have been made in an attempt to try to regain the
   advantages of economies of scale. The sub-contracting of sub-
   components and modularisation of product assemblies has allowed
    the backward diffusion of mass-production techniques to suppliers of
   intermediate goods. As labour-process analysts have demonstrated,
    an enormous amount of effort has been expended on attempts to
    intensify the use of labour to counteract falling profitability. Directly
   and indirectly, social scientists and industrial relations managers have
   worked on the problem of ‘motivations’ and ‘attitudes’, with
   increased performance and productivity as the criteria for their
    success.
    The limitations of Fordism in providing further productivity
    increases are even more pronounced in areas of work where volume
   and standardisation of products and components have proved
    difficult to attain. Variety in products, processes and raw materials,
    in addition to the size requirement of markets for products, provides
    strong barriers to the diffusion of Fordist techniques. Where

```

```
 standardisation of production and consumption cannot easily be
 ensured, as in the case of small-batch production and some services,
 productivity growth has tended to be low and such products relatively
 expensive. In manufacturing, the flexibility of operations characteris-
  tic of work processes which exhibit such variety has mainly been
 ensured by the use of skilled labour. Such flexibility has been an
 important factor ‘in the continued survival of craft workers. In this
 and the next two chapters we shall look at the means whereby the
 barriers to the wider extension of mass-production techniques could
 be overcome. Writers and management specialists dealing with the
 problems of Fordism have concerned themselves either with work
 organisation or with the issue of ‘new technology’. We will try to
 integrate these two areas by analysing the phenomenon of neo-
 Fordism as an emergent paradigm of labour process ‘design’
 involving new forms of control mechanisation. The intention will be
  to provide a basis for assessing the strategic importance of work
 reorganisation and technological change in the current restructuring
 process.
 WORK ORGANISATION
 We have described how a ‘labour process analysis’ of work, such as
 that of Braverman, defines the general trend of work organisation as
 towards increased division of labour, routinisation and simplification
 of most work tasks, whilst creating a hyper-skilled technical stratum,
 whose major function is to design and organise a technical system of
 production in a way which permits the direction of human labour and
 technology fitted into this system. The criticisms of this form of
 analysis have already been mentioned and can be briefly summarised.
  First, it has been suggested that Braverman’s notion of deskilling is
 too monolithic; it asserts that managers are always trying to deskill
 workers, are always successful, and that there are no counter-
 tendencies. Second, Braverman’s reference point for deskilling is a
 romanticised account of nineteenth-century engineering craft skill.
 This is historically limited and cannot be applied successfully in other
 areas. Third, he neglects the objective need for managers to utilise
 the co-operative character of labour in a production process. This
 results in a failure to acknowledge the alternative ways in which that
 co-operation can be achieved, and their potential effects on work
 organisation.

```

```
    To elaborate on these points, the empirical work on labour-process
   change carried out since Braverman’s book has shown that Taylorism
    was a more complex phenomenon than Braverman supposed. Its
   development and diffusion was not as linear as presented by
   Braverman. In fact it encountered several obstacles including
    resistance from supervisors as well as workers. Furthermore there
    have been, and may still be, circumstances in which Taylorism may
    be ‘reversed’ and fragmented jobs recombined, in response to
    specific pressures by some or all of the participants in the historical
    evolution of particular patterns of work organisation. More fun-
    damentally, it has been cogently argued that job fragmentation and
    job recombination as management strategies are not the coherent,
   planned strategies for control and production optimisation which the
    labour-process literature has suggested. This argument criticises the
   over-emphasis on foresight amongst entrepreneurs and managers,
    and the objective efficacy of organisational structures as means of
    achieving strategies even if they were to exist. A feature of both these
    criticisms is the emphasis on the capacity of workers and their
    organisations to respond to proposed changes in work organisation
    and in so doing force a compromise or bargain which makes the
   outcome diverge from any management strategies.
     Despite these criticisms of the precise way in which specific
   work-organisational forms have developed, there has been little
   disagreement that Braverman’s emphasis on deskilling is particularly
    relevant to an understanding of the period during which Fordism has
   been dominant. Some writers have suggested that these forms of
   work organisation have diffused into non-manufacturing sectors too.
    Studies of clerical work and computer programming show how such
   techniques have been used in an attempt to emulate the productive-
    ness of mass-production organisation in other non-mass-production
    industries.* Indeed, taking car assembly as the paradigm for changes
    in the labour process, many analyses see a common direction of
   changes in all labour processes, expressed as a tendential movement
   towards Fordism which is seen simply as a labour process consisting
    of highly differentiated jobs with mechanised pacing. So, for
   example, computerisation of information processing is interpreted as
    a means of institutionalising mechanised pacing in other industries
   and creating ‘assembly line’ conditions in offices (Barker and
   Downing, 1980, p. 86).
    However, there are several trends in job design and work
   organisation which run against such a tendency. There have been

```

-----

```
 moves towards ‘job enlargement’ (the grouping of several similar
  tasks to form a job rather than specialisation in one or two of these),
  ‘job enrichment’ (adding higher order tasks) and ‘group working’
 (where a large group of tasks is shared between a group of workers
 who allocate the tasks amongst themselves). These trends and
 experiments have been interpreted as the reversal of the trend
 towards an acute division of labour.
  The reversal of the division of labour which is favoured by theories
 and experiments in job design is hardly surprising. Many of the
  earliest post-war examples of work reorganisation, such as job
  rotation, were specifically advocated as a response to the boredom
 which was felt by workers carrying out the repetitive operations of
 semi-mechanised processes. From this crude model relating repeti-
  tion and boredom in work, industrial psychologists and sociologists
 have built up successive generations of theories linking aspects of
 work to psychological variables attributed to workers, such as
 motivation, satisfaction and the need for ‘growth’. These theories
 underpin attempts by managements to alter the allocation of tasks
 between various jobs in a way which reduces the fineness of the
  detailed division of labour.
   Despite the fact that many of the experiments and descriptions of
 the field focus on social psychological variables as central to work
 organisation and job design activities, it is impossible to assess
 adequately the effect of these techniques at such a level. This is
 because of the pragmatic nature of most of the changes. The
  multiplicity of behavioural and organisational variables against which
 changes are assessed make general conclusions difficult to draw.
 However, there are indications that more significant conclusions can
 be drawn on another level. For example, in a European survey of the
 objectives of firms carrying out such changes, Wild and Birchall,
  (1975) found a wide variety of reasons given. Yet they concluded that
  a minority of exercises have been carried out with the primary
 intention of improving the behavioural characteristics of jobs. Where
  this was the case, it was usually [as ] [a ]means [to ] [an ] [end, ] [such ] [as ] [reducing ]
 absenteeism or labour turnover [or ] [improving ] [product ] [quality. ]
  Many of the work-design experiments took place in assembly
 segments of mass-production manufacturing. One reason for this is
 the flexibility in work organisation which labour-intensive and
 relatively unmechanised segments, such ‘as assembly, possess.
 Another is the low level of job control which the (typically women)
 workers involved in such work display. However, a more important

```

```
   implication of such management practices is the evidence in provides
    for the economic limitations which Fordist assembly lines display —
   even in mass-production industries. The constraints of Fordism have
   been relaxed to some extent by the introduction of flexibility into
   assembly operations through work reorganisation. Rather than
   having one assembly line for the production of increasingly differenti-
    ated products, firms have found that it may make economic sense to
   shorten assembly lines and even introduce unit assembly in some
    cases, since the costs associated with product change-over grow as a
    result of intensified competition in more slowly growing or even
   contracting markets (Kelly, 1982b, p. 14; Coriat, 1980, p. 42).
    Such a strategy is compatible with the standardisation and
   modularisation of component parts in the more rigid, highly
   mechanised production lines. Modularisation is an attempt, by
    creating standardised sub-components, to allow mass-production
   techniques to be applied to intermediate products, increasing in
   volume and rationalising the variety of such products. This is, in fact,
   one attempt to overcome the ‘productivity dilemma’ highlighted by
   Abernathy (1978) where increased economies of scale are accom-
   panied by decreased flexibility within mature industries. A combina-
    tion of modularisation and flexible assembly procedures can act to
   reduce the rigidities of increased mechanisation.
    A second indication of the limitations which Fordist forms of work
   organisation exhibit comes from examinations of highly capitalised
    industries such as food-processing and chemicals. In these cases, the
   work tasks are not the repetitive tasks associated in engineering with
    feeding machines or manipulating parts in a regular, short-cycle
   sequence. Instead they are less regular monitoring and intervention-
    ist tasks. The stochastic nature of these tasks, as we shall see, can
    pose difficulties in their individual allocation, contrary to what
    Taylorism demands. Under such circumstances, the introduction of
    flexibility in the allocation of labour becomes economically advan-
    tageous. Thus experiments in group working have been frequent in
    these industries, such as in paper-making, food-processing, oil-
    refining and chemicals-manufacture.*
    Many writers on the labour process have dismissed these experi-
   ments in new forms of work organisation as minor or inconsequen-
    tial, rather than see them as genuine difficulties within labour-process
    analyses.” The target has been to refute the liberatory rhetoric
    justifying the experiments by pointing out the limited nature of the
    benefits to workers which are said to result from such reorganisa-

 tions. Whilst the recent experiments may be seen as more substantial
 than the 1930s ‘human relations’ techniques (contemptuously dismis-
 sed by Braverman as practised by the preventative ‘maintenance
 crew’ for the human machinery) they are nevertheless criticised as
 still hiding traditional methods of control. This view points to
 individualised responsibility for product quality and the linking of
 raised group output norms to bonus payments as the reality behind
 the rhetoric about increased autonomy and enriched work experi-
 ences. ;
  Other authors have examied work redesign experiments more
 systematically, pursuing the suspicion that they represent something
 more than a new set of clothes for old principles. In a painstaking
 survey of published accounts of work redesign experiments, along
 with several case studies, Kelly (1978, 1979, 1982a) outlines three
 categories of work redesign:
 @ vertical role integration: where certain types of fractional work
   roles are reassigned to operators (for example, inspection, testing,
  scheduling, elementary maintenance). These roles would pre-
  viously have been the responsibility of higher strata of workers
   (supervisory, technical or office personnel).
 ® reorganisation of flow-lines: where individualisation or a reduction
   of sequential work interdependencies takes place. This category
  mainly refers to the shortening of flow-lines, or a move to unit
  assembly mentioned previously. Often such a change is seen as a
  solution to the problem of changeover costs, delays caused by
   ‘balancing’ the flow of work along the line or attempts to avoid
   collective worker resistance to output norms.
 @ flexible work groups: here a group of tasks is allocated to a group
  of workers. Although this breaks down the permanent allocation
  of work tasks to particular jobs, it does not necessarily imply a
  radical despecialisation of function. This is because flexible
  allocation of tasks may be restricted to periodic inequalities in
  work loads after which workers may [return ] [to ] [their ] [specialised ]
   roles.
  Kelly’s analysis hangs on an examination of the claim made by job
 redesigners to have abandoned Taylorism as an organising principle
 of work. He argues that this claim is based on an identification of
 Taylorism with labour specialisation, whereas the latter was neither
 an integral nor a necessary feature of Scientific Management since,
 empirically, Taylor despecialised some groups of workers in his

```

-----

```
    reorganisation of work methods. Taylor’s Scientific Management,
    Kelly argues, was concerned with intensifying the utilisation of
    labour, along with other methods of increasing productivity, by a
    strategic use of individualised payment levels, training and work roles
    rather than specialisation (division of labour) as such, which
    pre-dated Taylorism itself.
     So, to what extent can these forms of work redesign be seen as
    different to Taylorism? Kelly’s view is as follows:
    @ vertical role integration is compatible with Taylorist techniques of
     assigning maximum work loads [to ] [a ] [category ] [of ] [labour ] [that ] [is ][as ]
     cheap as possible. It only becomes [novel ] [when ] [fractional ] [super- ]
     visory and management functions are added to these jobs — it is
     then not compatible with Taylorism.
    @ reorganisation of flow lines, in contrast to vertical role integration
      is, in fact, a most thorough and consistent application of
     Taylorism. Individualisation of work roles, breaking up work
     teams, increasing the visibility of each worker’s products, and the
     frequent use of individual pay incentives which follows the
     reduction of worker interdependencies — these are all techniques
     associated with Taylorism despite the despecialisation involved in
     such ‘horizontal’ role integration.
    @ the major innovation lies in the area of flexible work groups. This
     forms the distinctive practice of the forms of work organisation
     associated with the school of industrial sociology known as
     socio-technics.° The espousal of flexible work groups is a result of
     abandoning certain features of Taylorism; in particular, individual
     allocation of work, payment and accountability. But socio-technics
      has only done so, Kelly notes, to the extent that it has encountered
     limiting conditions of product or process uncertainty beyond which
     Taylorist principles have become less effective in achieving their
     stated goals. Socio-technical theorists have recognised the limits of
     their own work, but they have conceptualised it in terms of large
     task size rather than product or process variability.
     Kelly’s analysis has advantages over other, more descriptive
    reviews of job redesign experiments which results from its more
    refined model of work organisation.’ The analysis does not see
    Fordism as a distinct type of production process however. Given the
    central role played by Fordism in our analysis, we shall reinterpret
    Kelly’s findings in the context of our discussion of Fordism. We are

 assisted in this by Kelly’s conceptualisation of the design of jobs in
 terms of work roles:
   In a service or production organisation, the main products and
  materials flow sequentially through a series of (more or less)
  interdependent, work roles for processing. Attached to this
  horizontal organisation of roles are a number of off-shoots or
   vertically organised roles responsible for intervention in, or
  receipts from, the major flow of work. These vertically organised
   sections are responsible for such functions as maintenance, repair,
  material supply and collection, cleaning, inspection and supervision.
   It should be noted, however, that some of these functions may be
  designed into the main flow of work, such as brief quality checks,
  and the distinction between the two sets of roles is not absolute.
  (Kelly, 1979, p. 234)
  We have seen how Kelly’s threefold categorisation of work
 redesign is constructed from this model of work roles by specifying
 the addition of vertical, horizontal, and horizontal and vertical roles
 to an existing job. These correspond to vertical role enlargement,
 reorganisation of flowlines, and flexible working groups, respec-
 tively.
  This model of production organisation — a sequence of interdepen-
 dent horizontal roles within the sequential flow of materials — is in
 fact the division of labour associated with Fordism, whether it be a
 less mechanised assembly line, a more mechanised production line,
 or a highly mechanised flow process. Furthermore, the distinction
 between horizontal and vertical work-roles maps on to the contrast
 between the deskilled manipulating, machine-tending and feeding or
 material-transferring tasks assigned to workers ‘on the line’ and the
 technical, organisational and supervisory tasks of the vertical
 work-roles which are less machine-paced.
  Another area of industrial sociology — organisation theory — has
 concerned itself with developing a model such as this. In spite of the
 reductionist nature of this work (Mortensen, 1979) some of its writers
 have examined the conditions under which organisational changes
 occur in firms, which have interesting implications for the structure of
 work role allocation. The dual structure of horizontal and vertical
 work roles is noted by Thompson (1967) in his discussion of the
 internal structure of organisations. Thompson [describes ] [organisa- ]

    tions as consisting of a central core process surrounded by ‘buffering’
    mechanisms:
     To maximise productivity of a manufacturing technology, the
     technical core must be able to operate as if the market will absorb
     the single kind of product at a continuous rate, and as if inputs
     flowed continuously, at a steady rate and with specified quality.
     Conceivably both sets of conditions could occur; realistically they
     do not. But organisations reveal a variety of devices for approxi-
     mating these ‘as if’ assumptions, with input and output compo-
     nents meeting fluctuating environments and converting them
     into steady conditions for the technological core. (Thompson,
     1967, p. 20)
     Buffering, then, takes place on the ‘input’ side of the core process
    by ensuring the continuous availability of raw materials often in a
    varying market and feeding them steadily into the production
    process, and on the ‘output’ side by sales and marketing activities
    which try to ensure a constant or rising level of sales. The latter is
    especially important where goods are perishable or expensive to
    store. But it is in the manufacturing system itself that the distinction
    between core process and buffering mechanisms is of interest to us,
    for these define the difference between the two types of work-role.
     Workers in the core process will be allocated tasks which are highly
    prescribed (or as Hales, 1980, puts it, ‘preconceptualised’) in relation
    to the technical core. Hence, where labour is an integral part of the
    core — for example, in assembly or machine feeding or unloading —
    attempts are made to specify these tasks in a mechanical way.
    Therein lies the importance of time and motion studies and
    ergonomics, in fitting humans to machines. In contrast workers in the
    buffering functions are more concerned with ensuring the continuity
    of production, than with contributing directly to the core process.
    This peripheral work, then, is more contingent and less directly
    paced. These functions of maintenance, scheduling, allocation and
    supervision of labour, quality control and testing correspond to the
    vertical work-roles described by Kelly.
     The separation of core and peripheral work (horizontal and
    vertical work roles) is one of the basic features of Fordist labour
    processes. It is the relationship between core work, and _ its
    specification by peripheral workers which is at the root of the
    separation of conception and execution (Braverman), preconcep-

 tualisation (Hales) or forms of technical control (Edwards) in
 Fordism.®
  Having established the distinction between core and periphery
 processes, organisational theorists go on to describe the effects of
 changing environments on management structure.” Our concern is
 with the changes that take place in work organisation and technology
 in response to such environmental change. The important point here
 is that the Fordist division of labour in production depends not just
 on scale, but also on stability. We have argued that Fordist processes
 gained their economic viability under certain conditions: growing
 markets for regular commodities ensuring continuous flow of work
 with adequate supplies of labour and raw materials. Where these
 conditions do not apply — where there is variability in raw materials
 or work tasks, where technical change is high or products vary (as in
 small-batch production), where markets stagnate and raw materials
 costs increase steeply causing rapid changes in demand (as in the car
 industry since the 1960s) — the ability to achieve a stable core of
 horizontal work roles is difficult.
  Kelly’s three forms of work redesign (vertical role integration,
 flow-line reorganisation and flexible work groups) would seem to
 have similar potentialities for increasing the variety of work but there
 are important differences in the structural basis of these changes.
 Vertical role integration, given its minor part in reducing horizontal
 task interdependencies is important as a means of using the ‘idle time’
 (porosity) of particular jobs. This is achieved by allocating the worker
 certain peripheral tasks which need not be performed at any specific
 time. Since they are not sequentially dependent on previous and
 subsequent tasks, they can be performed in between regular tasks.
  Reorganisation of flow-lines introduces a different type of flexi-
 bility into a Fordist process. The move from sequential to parallel
 processing entails the circumvention of certain Fordist principles
 since it allows different workers to produce at different rates without
 problems of bottlenecks and line-balancing, as well as to produce
 different products, a feature especially important in small-batch
 production. Kelly found the majority of examples of reorganisation
 of flow-lines occurred in assembly or sequentially organised work in
 white-collar work areas. The resulting individualisation of tasks
 permitted management to increase working-time through reducing
 the amount of time spent in handling and waiting for parts. Quality
 improvements were also possible given that individuals were identifi-
 able as responsible for the production of particular items.'° In the

```

-----

```
    third category of work redesign, that of flexible groups, we noted
    Kelly’s explanation of this as a response to the problem of allocating
    labour economically under conditions of product or process uncer-
    tainty. He is able to support this position by reinterpreting the
    group-work experiments of key socio-technical writers as ultimately
    based on the intensification of labour. Yet the forms of flexibility
    which group work offers over Fordist configurations extend further
    than the quantitative allocation of labour. Group working may also
    involve multiskilling and planning functions (as we shall see in the
    case of Group Technology, discussed in Chapter 6). Furthermore,
    this form of organisation is a potential threat to forms of job control
    which are built upon demarcation and skill structures (Hull, 1978).
     In summary, then, the significance of the work-redesign experi-
    ments of the last two decades is that they try to break the structure of
    jobs organised around the division between horizontal and vertical
    work roles which is characteristic of Fordism. The reintegration of
    such roles will be used later as one feature of a definition of
    neo-Fordism. However, just as we have defined Fordism using a
    cluster of variables encompassing standard products, mass markets,
    dedicated production technologies, homogenised consumption norms
    and particular labour processes, we can define neo-Fordism using a
    similar range of variables. We have already noted some of these: a
    more differentiated range of products corresponding to increased
    heterogeneity of consumption and a more complex, differentiated
    market with shifting levels of technical change as constituting an
    important part of capitalist competition.
      In the next section we shall concentrate on the technological
    elements of the transition from Fordism to neo-Fordism in an attempt
     to relate the technological and organisational dimensions of the
    labour process visible during this transitional period.
   NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND FORMS OF MECHANISATION
    Whereas work redesign theorists attempt to construct criteria by
    which jobs ought to be constructed for psychological ends, their claim
    is also to reconcile these criteria with economic ones.'' What is
    missing from these analyses is an acknowledgement of the origin of
    these constituent tasks. Work redesign takes a contingent and partial
    view of technological change, orientated towards the bundling of
    tasks into jobs only after the technology has thrown up the tasks to be

```

-----

```
 ‘sorted’. As Herbst (1974) has pointed out, despite its theoretical
 claims to the contrary, even socio-technics has taken the technical
 system for granted in its actual design of work, concentrating on
 manipulating the social system around pre-set variables.
  What we have emphasised, however, is that we must recognise
 technological change as a significant factor in the changes in labour
 processes. Attention can thereby be drawn to the ‘creation’ of
 technologies and to the social relations implicit in the design of
 machinery. This approach contrasts sharply with the uncritical,
 emancipatory view of technological change put forward in the study
 of ‘alienation’ and ‘automation’ by such writers as Blauner (1964). In
 the recent debate on the effects of micro-electronics on the future of
 work, a similarly positive view of production technologies based on
 the silicon chip inherently leading to upgraded work is widespread.”
 Often this is the result of an assumption that core processes in all the
 major industries will be swiftly mechanised, resulting in the more
 skilled and potentially satisfying vertical work-roles remaining.
  The drawback to such general approaches to technological change
 as upgrading or degrading work is that they attempt to generalise
 across a large number of technical changes in a large number of
 industries. But we are not saying that a contingent approach to
 technological change is required which must examine each case
 independently. Obviously, there must be some contingency in any

 developments to account for differences in such things as the effects
 of management style or of workers’ collective strength. Yet such
 factors will only be operative within the limits created by general
 trends and particular forms of mechanisation. It is these issues which
 we wish to discuss in this section.
  We have discussed in Chapter 2 the conceptualisation of ‘automa-
 tion’ by Bright and Bell. We shall now develop Bell’s ideas further in
 order to clarify the differences in work organisation between Fordism
 and neo-Fordism. In contrast to Bright’s unilinear and progressive
 succession of stages in mechanisation, Bell’s three dimensional model
 of ‘automation’ is constructed in such a way as to stress the relative
 independence of the different types of mechanisation. This over-
 comes a problem of Bright’s scheme, which is the arbitrary nature of
 the sequence of his levels of mechanisation. '*
  We may envisage, therefore, seemingly highly ‘automated’
 machines whose degree of mechanisation is in one particular
 dimension only. Examples of this situation might be a very precise

    milling or grinding machine which was hand-fed with material and
    required manual setting up (that is, having a highly mechanised
    transformation function whilst the transfer and control functions are
    relatively unmechanised); or a manual assembly line fed by a
    conveyor-belt would represent a situation of mechanised transfer,
    whilst the transformation of parts (assembly) would be mechanised to
    a low degree in this case, perhaps using hand or pneumatic tools.
     In attempting to link together technological change and work tasks
    the most successful approach seems to be to analyse the latter in
    terms of the residual functions left unmechanised. That is, workers in
    the core process perform the tasks that machinery is unable to
    perform. Bell’s work is particularly useful in that regard. Using his
    model we might represent the residual tasks for the human operator
    under different conditions of mechanisation as in Figure 5.1.
     As each dimension becomes increasingly mechanised (represented
    by the bold lines) the corresponding human tasks are reduced
    (represented by the shaded areas). The configuration in A represents
    non-mechanised work, such as ‘craft work’, that is, the use of
    hand-tools with work in progress moved by hand, and perhaps
    consisting of tasks which rely highly on skill, planning and design.
    The introduction of machines using non-human labour power
    corresponds to B. When machines can be linked together by
    mechanised transfer systems, we have C, corresponding to the
    transfer line. Yet the forms of labour-intensive assembly lines usually
    associated with mass production work are nearer to D since they
    commonly only use hand- or powered-tools (spanners, screwdrivers,
    sewing-machines, soldering irons). The highest stage in this Fordist
    phase, E£, is characterised by self-acting control systems (though still
    with some manual control), until recently mainly found only in
    flow-processes, such as oil, paper, steel and chemicals and, some-
    times, food-processing.
     As far as the organisation of the labour process is concerned we can
    identify particular forms of work organisation generally associated
    with these different cases of mechanisation. Thus the largely
    unmechanised case, A, is associated with both craftwork and
    unmechanised industries characterised by a high division of labour
    (for example, much office work). The use of machinery in the
    transformative elements of production is represented by B. This
    creates tasks of machine-minding and maintenance besides the
    transfer tasks (feeding raw materials and removing finished products
    and waste, as well as the routeing of products between machines) and

    control tasks (setting up). Such tasks are often separated into skilled
   and non-skilled tasks, using Taylorist methods to prescribe the latter
   where routinisation is possible. This division is a crucial one for
   labour-process theory since, as we have seen, it is the basis of
   arguments over deskilling. Yet it is also central to a wider analysis of
    occupational segregation along the lines of gender, race and age,
    given the propensity of worker-resistance to be structured around
    skill definitions (for instance, see Cockburn’s, 1983 study of
   craftwork in printing). A similar position exists in the case of D.
    However, in this case, the labour intensity of the process is evident,
    given the low degree of transformation mechanisation. Such tasks
    often consist of assembly or manipulative work (testing, finishing,
    packaging). As such, the labour process analysis centred on Fordism
    is most directly applicable to this case; a high labour content,
   fragmented work paced by conveyor belts, repetitive, routinised
   work — all these are the archetypal characteristics of the Fordist
    labour process.
     The remaining two cases: C, representing the ‘Detroit’ transfer line
    and F, depicting highly capital-intensive flow-processes were the
    most ‘automated’ examples of manufacturing processes up to the
    early 1970s. However, the two are quite different as far as the labour
    process is concerned. In the case of C, the lack of sophisticated
    control systems makes the forms of work organisation highly
    prescribed. Thus there are tasks which need to be performed at
    particular points along the line — overseeing a certain machine,
   making up for deficiencies in mechanisation, checking quality — as
    well as non-mechanised tasks such as changing tools, loading
    magazines and certain other operations which cannot easily or
    cheaply be mechanised. In E£, on the other hand, although some fixed
    and paced work can still exist, much of the core work is mechanically
   executed leaving the vertical roles with a high control content.'*
     In general A-E might be thought of as representing phases in the
    evolution of Fordist mechanisation. However, the introduction of
    computerised control systems permits certain intermediate states
    which correspond to the developments of neo-Fordism. The contrast
    between Fordism and neo-Fordism at a technological level, lies in
    changes in the control dimension. The forms of mechanisation under
    Fordism differ from neo-Fordist forms in terms of the relative
    inflexibility of the former and the flexibility of the latter. In Fordism
    incremental changes in the control mechanisms incorporated in
   machinery have the effect of reducing the variety of operations

  possible with a single piece of machinery. The creation of specialised
  machinery, or ‘dedication’ of otherwise flexible, tool-like machinery
  using such things as fixtures and stops, became feasible only with
  increased volumes of production. But this was only part of the
  process, the integration of a collection of such machines into a higher
  Stage of this type of mechanisation — the transfer line — further
  exacerbated such inflexibility (see Abernathy, 1978). The creation of
  Fordist, highly mechanised systems of production, then, was feasible
  only under certain highly specific conditions, a point we have argued
  earlier, in Chapter 2.
   What neo-Fordism is about at a technological level is a develop-
  ment and refinement in control systems both on individual machines
  and in the co-ordination of sets of transformation and transfer
  mechanisms. The next chapter will detail this for the small-batch
  engineering industries by examining the development and use of
  numerically-controlled and computer-controlled machine tools in
  cellular systems and, ultimately, linked together in so-called
  computer-aided manufacturing systems.
   However, neo-Fordist developments in technology need not take
  the form of integrated, highly mechanised processes of the ‘auto-
  mated factory’ model. Intermediate stages of neo-Fordist mechanisa-
  tion corresponding to cases B and D can occur. The existence of
  stand-alone computer-controlled machinery (machine tools, sewing
  machinery, weaving looms, etc.) is the neo-Fordist equivalent to B.
  Whereas the use of computer-controlled transfer machinery, such as
  in the robotic handling systems or flexible pallet transfer systems
  replacing the conveyor belt as used in Fiat’s car assembly plant
  (Amin, 1982) corresponds to D. Such changes may themselves be
  transcended by further mechanisation, such as the use of mechanised
  handling between discrete machines, say, by robots, in the former
  case or by the mechanisation of assembly in the latter. Of course,
  such changes will not necessarily occur in a step-wise fashion
  mirroring the logic of this categorisation. It is quite likely that
  significant changes in the product would be a prerequisite to further
  mechanisation (Barron and Curnow, 1979, p. 131).
   It is important to emphasise that the distinction between Fordism
  and neo-Fordism is being used to distinguish between the dominant
  forms of production associated with leading industries and sectors in
  different phases of economic growth. It might be argued though, that
  this distinction is weakened by the existence of flow-process plant
  which exhibits a high degree of mechanisation along all Bell’s

    dimensions, as well as displaying some elements of neo-Fordist work
    organisation. In fact, the early studies of Blauner (1964) and
   Woodward (1965) both identify process plant as a distinctive form of
    ‘production technology’. Blauner, however, suggested that chemical
    plant technology represented the eventual direction of development
    of the less mechanised, batch and mass production systems for
    discrete items. It was not possible for him to envisage such a
   development in terms of the crude mechanical, electro-mechanical
    and mainframe computer-based control systems then available,
    around which the ‘automation debate’ of mid-1960s revolved.
     Nevertheless, Blauner’s study was ultimately limited by his
    overriding concern with the fate of blue-collar work. By treating
    ‘automation’ as the mechanisation of horizontal work roles, leaving
    the upgraded vertical roles intact, he was able to infer a correlation
    between increased ‘automation’ and work characterised by decreased
    ‘alienation’. In concentrating on shop-floor work he neglected the
    major area for the impact of ‘automation’ — the conceptual areas.
    The vertical work-roles of design, planning, scheduling, etc., which
    Blauner took as remaining fairly constant, are in fact the areas being
    reconstituted by information technologies and neo-Fordism. Hence,
    to argue that process plant exhibited neo-Fordism in only valid
    inasmuch as part of its work-role structure displayed particular
    aspects of neo-Fordism. With information technologies and increas-
    ing computerisation of process control, the residual vertical tasks are
    also likely to be greatly transformed.
    A similar phenomenon is associated with neo-Fordist technological
    changes in other sectors. For example, computer-aided design
   (CAD) is often twinned with computer-aided manufacturing (CAM)
    as important developments in the potential integration of conceptual
    and executive labour processes via linked CAD/CAM computer
    systems. Information-technology-based systems for stock control,
    production planning and scheduling are essential parts of the
    informational infrastructure around which neo-Fordist labour pro-
    cesses are structured.'°
   NEO-FORDISM
    In summary, our definition of neo-Fordism consists of several
    interdependent strands. These are:
    @ technological developments in control mechanisation which

   weaken the link between mechanisation and scale. This ‘flexible’
   form of mechanisation permits increased variablity in products and
   processes to be accommodated at higher levels of mechanisation.
  © organisational changes which tend to favour the adoption of work
   roles, rather than individual repetitive tasks organised on an
   hierarchical basis.
  In contrast to a core or line process around which work is organised,
  there is more potential for a functional division of labour structured
  around semi-autonomous groups of workers and machinery
  whose co-ordination depends on the setting up of:
  © informational infrastructures which integrate different productive
   sub-units (semi-autonomous groups, machining centres or dif-
   ferent interdependent, geographically-separated production units)
   with control of materials flow, stock control and production
   planning.
   Other writers concerned with neo-Fordism have used the term in
  three senses:
  © to refer to the intensification which occurs by means of ‘thinning
   out’ of hierarchically-structured work-organisation. The integra-
   tion of previously distinct tasks (job enlargement and enrichment)
   is seen as a development of Fordism in response to changed
   conditions of labour market supply and problems of the control of
   labour (for example, Palloix, 1976).
  © changes in the organisation of working practice which can
   accompany increased mechanisation. The development of semi-
   automatic machinery which does not require the continuous
   presence of a human operator and/or where tasks are variable in
   timing and content (for example, process plant) may preclude the
   distribution of repetitive tasks on an individual basis. New forms of
   work organisation, other than those associated with Taylorist and
   Fordist models are necessary if labour is to be used economically
   (Kelly, 1978, 1982a).
  © the extension and development of mass-production techniques to
   new areas of production and services previously outside the ambit
   of such techniques. This includes attempts to rationalise and
   ‘automate’ small- and medium-batch engineering through the use
   of Group Technology and Flexible Manufacturing Systems.
   Similarly, the use of information technology in clerical and service

```
     industries would be potential fields for the development of
     neo-Fordist techniques (see Aglietta, 1979).
    Our use of the term embraces all of these. Most labour process
    theorists tend to analyse the significance of neo-Fordism only in
    terms of the attempt by capital to intensify work. Even though some
    of them draw attention to certain aspects of the other two, the focus
    in such cases is predominantly on new modes of control or increased
    exploitation of labour.'® There is something to say for such an
    analysis. Many firms, in their attempts to ease the squeeze on profits
    arising from increased competition, have used job redesign tech-
    niques as a means of effectively increasing the work-load. Indeed job
    redesign consultants have played on such productivity-enhancing
    potential in ‘Quality of Working Life’ changes as a means of selling
   work humanisation schemes to hesitant managers.
      It would be unwise, however, to write off work redesign as just
   management's latest fad for intensifying work. It does also focus
    attention on the human aspects of production system design and
    challenges aspects of current engineering and systems design
    practice.'’ In these areas, if not in the sphere of economics directly,
    the prevalent orthodoxy of treating labour inputs as similar to, or
    subordinate to, fixed capital inputs is being contested.
    However, job redesign as a set of developing techniques is more
    than just a productivity tool. There has been a tendency amongst
    writers of the labour process to extrapolate their analysis of deskilling
    as the progressive routinisation of tasks to encompass, in time, all
    work. What this extrapolation overlooks, however, are the contradic-
    tory elements in such a process. Earlier, we considered how such
    contradictions can form the basis for job control by workers including
    the maintenance of craft-type skills. This applies particularly to work
    involving a degree of variety where routinisation is not economical or
   where successful worker-resistance has avoided it. If we take the case
    of workers whose jobs have already been ‘deskilled’, in the sense that
    they could not lay claim to craft-type job controls, a deskilling
    analysis offers little in the way of restitutive strategies to regain
   non-degraded work. We have argued that this is a reflection of the
    individualistic nature of a deskilling analysis based on the notion of
    craft skills. What is needed is an analysis which recognises the
    collective nature of modern production processes. Job redesign
    analysts have made at least exploratory movements in this direction.
   The élitism of protecting the craft skills of ‘labour aristocrats’ from

  degradation should be replaced by a consideration of what strategies
  may be appropriate to semi-skilled and unskilled workers who form
  the majority of manufacturing workers, most particularly the
  majority of women and black workers. In this sense, the concept of
  neo-Fordism has particular advantages — not least the potential
  upgrading of work which it may entail. Furthermore, given the
  imminent changes in the organisation of service occupations, such an
  analysis is much more likely to be appropriate to these workers than
  one based on an over-humanised conception of a craft worker.
  ‘In this chapter, we have tried to develop such an analysis by
  making clear the distinction between Fordism and neo-Fordism. The
  conceptual framework which has been developed will allow us to
  operationalise the concept of neo-Fordism by investigating changes
  currently taking place in two sectors: small-batch engineering and
  services. These have been chosen for their potential importance
  amongst the leading sectors in any future economic upswing.

 6 Neo-Fordism in Small-
   batch Engineering
   INTRODUCTION
    In this chapter we will take the example of small-batch engineering
    and argue that this is a sector which is undergoing neo-Fordist
    changes. The sector is important because of its position in the
    production of capital goods. Hence, transformations in technology
    and organisation within this sector which result in cheapening its
    products are likely to have widespread effects throughout many other
    sectors which use these capital goods.
     In discussing the trajectory of Fordism, it was clear that the
    pre-conditions for the diffusion of Fordism in this industry were not
    satisfied, given the range of products and instability of markets
    characteristic of batch engineering production. Thus the major part
    of mechanical engineering was relatively isolated from changes
    associated with Fordism, permitting the continued existence of
    skilled work, organised around craft structures as the central core of
    small-batch engineering labour processes. New mass-production
    areas of engineering grew up alongside the traditional industry.
     Yet technological changes and organisational innovations which
    prove more appropriate to the transformation of small-batch
    engineering have been attempted. As we investigate such changes
    below, we will argue that such developments do not represent a mere
    extension of Fordism into small-batch engineering with somewhat
    limited success. They entail a discontinuity with Fordism and are
    more akin to the configuration of neo-Fordism. At the level of the
    labour process, the development of sophisticated control mechanisa-
    tion and production organisation which is not based on a flowline
    core production process, makes orthodox labour process analyses
    problematic. The separation between programming and operation of
    ‘Numerically Controlled’ (NC) machinery, which Braverman noted,
    is uneven and is often later reversed on ‘Computer Numerical

  Control’ (CNC) machines. This can not merely be explained by
 worker resistance and managerial strategies on the shop-floor. Nor
  can such ‘variability’ in the division of labour be simply relegated to
  the contingent interplay between various wider factors, such as
 product markets and trade union organisation. The problem of
  explaining such variability lies in a confusion at the analytical level.
 Changes which prefigure neo-Fordism are difficult to analyse on the
  basis of Fordism.
  What follows, therefore, is a description of the neo-Fordist
 developments within small-batch engineering. Obviously, this is a
 continuing process and is by no means complete. Nevertheless, our
 aim is to demonstrate the value of such an analysis in accounting for
  current changes in this sector, rather than one of the more or less
  successful playing out of Fordist tendencies. After an_ initial
 description of the sector, we will examine some existing labour
 process analyses of technical changes in small-batch engineering and
 contrast these accounts with a more detailed description and analysis
 of successive changes in the production process which reflect the
 contradictory goals and partial solutions accompanying the process of
 transformation in this sector.
 SMALL-BATCH ENGINEERING
 Despite the preponderance of mass-production techniques in
 accounting for the bulk of the output of the engineering industry, the
 majority of employment within mechanical engineering involves
 production in batches rather than mass production. In Britain,
 mechanical engineering accounts for approximately one third of total
 engineering employment (Swords-Isherwood and Senker, 1980).
 Hence radical changes in batch engineering will have an appreciable
 effect within the engineering industry as a whole. This is in addition
 to the ‘knock on’ effect on other industries using capital goods made
 in the mechanical engineering industry. In Chapter 4 we noted that
 the cheapening of capital goods production was particularly import-
 ant for a renewed sustained upswing in economic growth; so
 transformations within small-batch engineering production are of
 strategic significance for all sectors of production, though it is worth
 noting that the techniques exemplified in this transformation are also
 applicable to other, non-engineering, batch-manufacturing sectors
 such as clothing, footwear or furniture and might indeed be crucial if
 these sectors are to recover from their current depression.

     In the mechanical engineering industry despite the wide range of
    separate processes carried out (forming, casting, welding, cutting,
    surface finishing, making tools, jigs and dies, and assembly) it is
    metal-cutting which is the major activity. Although there are new
    techniques which are likely to be important in other processes, the
    largest impact on organisation, employment and skill levels as well as
    on the cheapening of products is most likely to result from
    technological and organisational changes around the cutting of
    metals. Significantly, most attention has been addressed to the effects
    of computerising control functions in metal-cutting machinery.
     In a later section, we will extend this focus to cover developments
    in the mechanisation of parts-transfer between machines as well as
   computer co-ordination systems (and information systems) on which
    mechanisation of transfer would need to rely. For the moment,
    however, the discussion will be restricted to the debate over the
    labour-process implications of numerical control in metal-cutting
    machine tools. The discussion will be broadened subsequently by
    looking at the organisational changes associated with ‘Group
    Technology’ and their relation to technological changes before
    leading on to an interpretation of current transformations in
    small-batch engineering which develops the concept of neo-Fordism.
   NUMERICAL CONTROL AND THE CONTROL OF
   WORKERS
    In the debate over ‘deskilling’, one of the commonest examples has
    been that of changes in metal-cutting machinery particularly the
    introduction of Numerical Control (NC). NC lathes, for instance,
    replace the manual controls of cutting speed and tool movement,
    which rely on work planning and the hand-eye co-ordination of
    skilled machinists, with mechanised controls operated by a sequence
    of instructions from a punched paper tape, or directly from a
    computer. Braverman’s work contained an extended argument
    (1974: pp. 184-248) on the separation between programming and
    machine operating. He used this as an example of the division of
    labour between conception and execution which, for him, repre-
    sented the hallmark of changes in the labour process under monopoly
    capitalism. By removing programming functions to the office, capital
    was able to increase control over the labour process, undermining the
    skills of the skilled worker, and to use this control to increase the rate

```
  of production, whilst at the same time using cheaper unskilled
 machine-minders.
  Braverman’s work has been extended in research conducted by
 Noble (1979). He goes further than Braverman in tracing the
  historical development of NC machinery in preference to other
 metal-cutting technologies which did not permit deskilling to be
 imposed on skilled machinists. Nobel notes how NC machinery,
 along with a highly sophisticated software package, was heavily
 underwritten and championed by the US Air Force, thus highlighting
 the crucial role of military requirements in the development and
 diffusion of the new technology. Whilst the high-technology nature of
 such capital-intensive equipment favoured the complex machining
 requirements of Air Force orders, it also gave a distinct advantage to
 the large firms in bidding for orders, since with Air Force support
 they could afford to purchase and use such equipment more than
 small firms. This further aided the process of monopolisation in the
 industry and was an important element of the prime contractor/
 subcontractor division amongst the US aerospace industry noted by
 Jones (1982a).
  Yet the main weight of Noble’s argument is put on the contestation
 of control on the shop-floor. NC is advantageous to management
 because of the potential which (they think) it holds for ‘enhancing
 their authority over production, despite questionable  cost-
 effectiveness’ (Noble, 1979: p. 34). The technology has such
 possibilities for increasing managerial control that it is ‘seized upon’
 by management notes Noble, quoting Braverman. Yet by accentuat-
 ing capital—labour relations more than other important relations —
 capital-capital (competition), labour-labour (gender and skill),
 state—capital (the ‘military industrial complex’) — besides the tech-
 nical capabilities of NC over rival technologies, Noble reduces his
 account to playing out a political battle for control on the shop-floor.
 What is more, by elucidating the difficulties of estimating the
 economic returns and therefore the viability of new technology,
 Noble (1979, p. 35) closes off economic explanations for the use of
 NC on the basis of the existence of economic uncertainty.
  Having relegated economic considerations to the level of justifica-
 tions on the part of management, Noble is able to continue to
 describe the politics of shop-floor conflict for control in terms of the
 dialectic between management ‘dreams’ and shop-floor ‘reality’.
 Manufacturing engineers and managers develop technologies and
 organisational systems to subordinate and displace workers: yet, the

```

-----

```
    reality encompasses a failure to achieve such dreams. Stoppages and
    strikes over rates of pay for the new machines and thus the assigning
    of labour grades are common, Noble argues, especially in plants
   where machinists’ unions have had a long history. However, the
    limitations of the NC machinery itself also work against the
    technological illusion. The operator’s role may be reduced in
   comparison with some of the craft-like skills of workers on the old
   machinery, but the yield and quality of the products are still heavily
   dependent on the ‘unskilled’ operatives. Hence new niches are
    revealed for worker control and management is once again con-
    fronted with problems of ‘motivation’.
    Another empirical study, this time a British one, is also less
   convinced as to the inevitability of the deskilling process as described
   by Braverman. Wilkinson (1981) investigates the politics of technical
   change in batch manufacturing, including machine shops. He also
    sees the eventual pattern of work organisation and division of labour
    as the outcome of a process of contestation and negotiation. The
    incremental nature of technical changes in batch processes allows, he
    argues, a greater degree of contestation over the organisation and
    introduction of work and machinery than is the case when whole
    systems are designed and proved outside the workplace and then
    installed en bloc (for example, flow-process plant). He is able to
   demonstrate this ‘shop-floor politics’ through various case studies.
    What becomes clear from these studies is the continuity which
    exists between working practices on the old and new machinery.
    Wilkinson attributes this to the interests of various parties (manage-
    ment, programmers, operators) being played out in the bargaining
    arena during the process of introducing the new technology. For
   example, during the period when a particular piece of ‘automatic’
   machinery was being ‘debugged’, there was an opportunity to
    establish certain working practices (for instance, using manual
    overrides to control the speed and quality of machining) which were
    subsequently retained. This was a way of ‘clawing back’ skills which
    were supposedly incorporated into the ‘automatic’ system. These
   emergent working-practices were found by Wilkinson to have an
    important role in determining the final form of work organisation. In
    fact, it was often the case that the quality of products crucially
   depended on the ‘knowledgeable’ intervention of operators despite
    the degree of automaticity claimed for the machinery (Wilkinson,
    1981, p. 123).
    As far as the practices of management was concerned, these

 varied. There were several attempts to avoid losing control of the
 production process to the workforce by ‘debugging’ the new
 machinery away from the shop-floor. But direct control was not the
 only strategy used by managements. Wilkinson also found a case
 where management recognition of the importance of workers’ skills
 and goodwill resulted in a system of improved working conditions
 and job rotation’ (Wilkinson, 1981, p. 198). This contributed to a
 manifest variability in the eventual system of work organisation
 between firms using similar technology. The general thrust of this
 work, then, is very much against a deterministic approach to skill and
 organisation changes. As Wilkinson argues:
  The contribution of the case studies to the skills debate is (i) that
  technology is not autonomous and therefore does not have impacts
  regardless of the social context, and (ii) that forces of competition
  do not impel firms to impose specific skill structures. Rather it was
  shown that the technical and social organisation of work — and thus
   real skills — is a negotiable phenomenon, determined by social and
  political processes whose outcomes were never very certain.
  (Wilkinson, 1981, p. 210)
  There is a major problem associated with an analysis of this sort.
 The uncertainties which Wilkinson seeks to incorporate into his
 ‘bargaining’ model of labour process change are simultaneously used
 to hold off any explanations based on economic or ‘efficiency’
 criteria. Thus, like Noble, the complexities of economic evaluations
 of new technologies in practice is interpreted as leave to put such
 considerations aside:
  In fact, what our case studies show is that arguments about the
  efficiency of new production technologies are often no more than
  scientific glosses which conceal or obscure the political considera-
  tions which have gone in to decisions on technical change and work
  organisation. (Wilkinson, 1981, pp. 194-5; emphasis original)
 By concentrating on the legitimatory functions of claims to efficiency
 or economy, the political economy of technological change becomes
 reduced to a politics of shop-floor struggle over new technology. Just
 like many labour process studies there is a reification of ‘control’
 which hides the relationship between the macro-level structural
 conditions of capital accumulation (markets, competition, product

    change) and the micro-level interactional arena of shop-floor negotia-
    tion in particular firms.
    A further empirical study of NC which contests the deskilling thesis
    is that of Jones (1982a). He introduces additional factors which
    influence the deployment of skills in NC machining such as the nature
    of the products, the composition of demand, the supply of skilled
    labour and the structure of trade union organisation. This analysis is
    not incommensurate with the general position argued here — at least
    as far as the range of factors which relate to the structure of the
    labour process in NC machining is concerned. For example, he notes
    the tendency for less complex components and increasing batch sizes
    to be associated with NC operation by semi-skilled workers (Jones,
    1982a, p. 193). Also he found that criteria for investment in NC
    machinery were less concerned with the cost of labour (contra
   Braverman) and more concerned with such things as the increased
    accuracy of NC machined components and the shortage of highly
    skilled labour in the local labour market.!
     The central feature of these writers’ work relates to their
    explanation of the observed variability of skill deployment in NC
    machine shops. Noble accounted for this in terms of the limitations of
   NC machinery and management control systems, which was ex-
    pressed as the continued dependence of management on operators’
    tacit knowledge. The shop-floor battle for control continued,
    however, with management trying to deskill and control workers
    directly. Wilkinson also drew attention to this phenomenon. Yet,
    unlike Noble’s assumption that an alternative division of labour
    reuniting programming and operating is only feasible on the basis of
    collective worker resistance (Noble, 1979, pp. 45-50), Wilkinson
    notes the success which some NC operators had in gaining access to
    machine-based editing facilities to the extent of using the latter to
    create their own programmes! Wilkinson has a less deterministic
    model of the direction of change of the labour process, acknowledg-
    ing that different management strategies are possible other than an
    overriding concern with direct control. Furthermore he notes
    significant variations in the degree of constraint which factors such
    as the design of technology, and the result of the implementation
    and debugging procedures have on the labour process. This can
    lead to consequent variations in the eventual form of work
    organisation.
     Jones’ position, on the other hand, is much more ambivalent. The
    variability of skill distribution and work organisation which Jones

```

-----

```
 observed is used as a means of rejecting any general or unilinear
 tendency towards deskilling or skill polarisation. The amount of
  variation amongst Jones’s sample, accounted for by multiple and
 interacting factors of product and labour markets, trade union
 organisation and technology, leads him to a position of indeter-
 minacy. He rejects the existence of any unitary tendency towards a
  particular structuye of the labour process. He assumes that there is no
 reason why other areas of manufacturing besides small-batch
 engineering should not display an equivalent diversity of organisa-
  tional forms (Jones, 1982a, p. 200).
   Rejecting any over-determining direction of labour process de-
 velopment, such a conclusion, whilst reflecting the degree of
 complexity of labour process change in practice, ends up agnostic
  with respect to general dynamics of labour process change. It is a
  belief in total contingency. In other words, the inadequacy of a
 simple structural model of technical change under capitalism (that is,
 variants of ‘deskilling’) becomes the occasion for neglecting the
 construction of a more adequate structural analysis of contemporary
 changes in the labour process.
   It should be clear that our argument does not seek to deny the
 empirically observed diversity of work organisation under NC. In
  that sense, the determinist overtones previously criticised in labour
 process theory are avoided. Nevertheless, the structural argument
 being proposed is based on a model of dominant configurations of the
 labour process (Fordism, neo-Fordism) being associated with certain
 industries in different phases of the long wave.
  The reason why Wilkinson and Jones are able to reject a inherent
  ‘deskilling’ tendency on the basis of their case studies, is that they are
 looking for evidence of a transformation towards Fordism within
 small-batch engineering. With large batches of simple and similar
 components examples of Fordist labour processes can be found. Yet
  this accounts for a minority of cases. Hence the diversity. What
 should be examined is whether we can analyse the ‘automation’ of
 small-batch engineering as representing a shift from a ‘craft’ to a
 neo-Fordist labour process. At the end of Chapter 5 we defined the
 labour process of neo-Fordism as consisting of several interdepen-
 dent strands — technological, organisational and informational. We
 think that contemporary changes in the labour process of small-batch
 engineering can be analysed in terms of these’ aspects of neo-Fordist
 transformation. In examining successive attempts to transform
 small-batch engineering we hope to demonstrate that neo-Fordism is

```

-----

```
    a more useful concept with which to understand the dynamics of
    these structural changes than the labour process analyses.
    As different aspects of neo-Fordist transformation are discussed it
    will become apparent that initiatives and experiments within the
    industry often focus on one or, sometimes, two of the three aspects;
    hence the history of such changes is one of partial solutions. The
    result, then, is more a residue of the most useful techniques than an
    accretion of the most successful experiments. Thus an organisational
    innovation, ‘Group Technology’, which is discussed below, becomes
    a basis of flexible manufacturing cells rather than being widely
    diffused itself, in toto, as a new way of organising machine shops.
    Similarly, NC machinery is limited in its potential for ‘automating’
    skilled machinist work, not least by problems of ensuring quality of
    output (Doring and Salling, 1971). Hence deskilling may prove to
    have limited economic returns as labour costs become less important
    than scrap rates or rates of machine utilisation under conditions of
    rising capital intensity. NC machinery, then, may be more economi-
    cally justifiable if operated by skilled rather than unskilled workers.
    A limitation to any account of changes in small-batch engineering
    is the inevitable uncertainty of the final outcome given the fact that
    the process is still in train. Nevertheless, it will be argued that there
    does seem to be sufficient evidence to support a neo-Fordist
    explanation of current changes in the industry. It is in this context
    that shop-floor politics should be situated at the level of particular
    firms.
   ORGANISATIONAL CHANGE IN MACHINE SHOPS: THE
   ESPOUSAL OF GROUP TECHNOLOGY
    Since the last century the dominant form of plant layout in batch
    engineering has been that of functional layout in which machines are
   grouped by machine type in ‘shops’ or work area (see Figure 6.1(c)).
    This structure mirrors the range of individual processes (such as
    drilling, welding, turning, milling, etc.) which are available for use in
    manufacture. It also reflects the dominant forms of occupational
    specialisation based on skilled ‘trades’. Depending on the product
    being made, the sequence of operations in manufacture, and thus the
    routeing of components or semi-completed products will vary. This
    necessitates some control over the transfer sequence of parts between
    shops, and also some means of monitoring the location of work in

  progress. At present this is done bureaucratically by means of
  production planners and progress chasers. It is only when products
  are standardised to a large extent, in terms of the sequence and type
  of manufacturing operations, that the line layout (Figure 6.1.(a)),
  characteristic of mass production, is viable.

    However, the price of maintaining flexibility by a functional layout
    is very high compared with that of mass production. Cook (1975)
   estimates the difference in cost between conventional batch manufac-
   turing and mass production to be in the order of ten to thirty times as
   much per unit of product. In part, this is due to the cost of setting up
   the machinery between batches which can result in the machine only
   cutting for an average of 15-20 per cent of the time that the
   workpiece is on the machine table (Williamson, 1972, p. 142).
   Furthermore, the time taken for a batch to move around the plant
   can account for most of its life in the factory. Williamson suggests
   that this is accounted for in queueing and waiting time; this is in
   addition to the time taken for the long journey between different
   shops (Williamson, 1972, p. 142). The different paths taken by
   different products result in an extremely complicated pattern of
   material flow (see Figure 6.2(i)) which adds to the problems of
   production planning and results in lengthy ‘throughput times’ and
   hence high levels of work in progress.
    The particular problems of batch-production organisation then, have
   important implications for the process of change in this sector.
   Attempts to increase productivity by increasing the speed of cutting
    has a minor effect on total costs; this is due to the small amount of
   time which a particular machine is actually working during a shift.
   Indeed the substitution of individual NC machines or ‘machining
   centres’ (which are able to carry out several metal-cutting operations
    in succession) can result in bottlenecks elsewhere in the plant, so
   these machines often end up working well below capacity (Gallacher
   and Knight, 1973).
    During the 1960s and 1970s, however, a different type of plant
   layout was championed for batch production. This was known as
   ‘Group Technology’ (GT).? GT involved grouping machinery on the
   basis of what machines were necessary for the production of a range
   of broadly similar products or components within«»a component
   ‘family’. The result is the group /ayout featured in Figure 6.1(b). Such
    a configuration permits the production of different products requiring
   different sequences of machining. By creating small production cells,
   each able to produce a more limited range of products than can be
   produced among a collection of machine shops, economies can be
   made in the use and turnover of fixed capital.
    There are two major sources of economy here which are said to
    result from the use of GT. They are those derived from (i) simplified
   flow-paths for materials and (ii) reduced times for setting-up

  machines. By grouping machines on the basis of component families,
  the flow of work becomes more regular, whilst retaining flexibility in
  the sequence of operations within the particular group. Also, the
  increased proximity of different machines required for the production
  of a particular component reduces the distance over which the work
  has to be transferred between operations (see Figure 6.2).
   Using this form of layout, however, entails the grouping of
  products into families on the basis of a similar set of machining
  operations. This is a prerequisite for planning the composition of
  machines which make up each group. However, the classification of
  product types also has a further importance. By reducing the variety

```

```
   of products which are worked on a particular machine the setting-up
   time can be reduced because of the narrow differences between
   components of the same family. Also by planning the sequence of
   components being machined, as discussed later, changeover times for
   resetting machines between components can often be reduced even
   more.
    So far it might be possible to interpret cell grouping and family
   machining as a half-way house between functional layout and the line
   organisation of Fordism. That is, it is compatible with a tendential
   movement towards Fordism given the limitations imposed by product
   variety. However, there are several respects in which GT differs
   significantly from Fordism.
    The first of these is associated with changes in the size of batches.
    In functional layout, production is organised around the concept of
   the minimum economic batch quantity (EBQ). This represents the
   supposed optimal quantity in terms of the unit cost of a batch of
    identical components, balancing preparation costs (ordering and
    setting up) and carrying costs (storage expenses, along with the fixed
    capital tied up in component stocks). Hence the volume of stock
   held is directly related to the size of the EBQ. As this stock levels
    falls low, a new batch of parts is produced in the ‘economic’
   volume.
    Where Fordism would suggest a rationalisation of products in
   order to achieve lower variety and longer runs in production, GT
   proposes a reduction in batch sizes. In the case of functional layout
   using stock control and EBQs there are multiple cycles of production
   for different components. This is because the different components
   are scheduled for production at random times depending on the stock
    level of a particular item falling below a minimum number. In
   contrast, GT reduces the average size of batches by replacing the
   multiple cycles of stock control by a single cycle of small batches of
   components made to a regular production schedule (Burbidge, 1974,
   p. 78). In this way, it is argued, a reduction in stock levels can be
   achieved. This is augmented by shorter waiting and handling times
   which become possible when adjacent cells make the different
   components for a product in parallel. This has the advantage of
   increasing the flexibility of batch production thus reducing the time
   taken to produce a particular order, or batch of products. Similarly
   the form of production control associated with GT contains the
   potential for a reduction in the lead-time for producing new or
   changed products and a reduction in component obsolescence

```

```
  occurring on changeover since components are produced in product
   sets. Hence, there is a second aspect of the neo-Fordist character of
  GT: its appropriateness to variety and change in products.
   Crucially, however, the feasibility of this form of production
  organisation depends on a reduction of the time in setting-up
  machines without which increasing setting-up costs would severely
  reduce the economic benefits of reduced stock levels and shortened
  lead-times. Originally, this was carried out by using such techniques
   as: attention to the sequence of products (minimising the amount of
  setting-up changes between products); creating ‘families’ within
  tools; pre-setting of tools in tool-holders; and later the use of
  co-ordinate setting techniques and digital component-size monitoring
  to avoid using stops. Of course, the use of numerically controlled
  machinery to reduce setting-up time has become more important
  recently as they have diffused more widely into this sector. Yet, the
  forecast coming together of numerical control and GT has not
  occurred to any great extent (Swords-Isherwood and Senker, 1978,
  prez):
    Finally, both line- and function-layout can be accompanied by
  increased specialisation in the division of labour. By allocating
  particular tasks to workers on work-stations or within particular
  shops, skills can be restricted or eliminated. Within machine shops,
  worker-resistance in the form of job controls has had a definite
  protective effect on the erosion of skill.* Yet job controls are limited
  in most cases to particular skilled ‘trades’. The work of other
  semi-skilled workers in shops and workers in mass-production lines is
  much more specialised and, therefore, open to routinisation and
  degradation.
   The ‘cell’ type of organisation favoured by GT, however, can cut
  across the forms of work organisation and job control in machine
  shops which are characteristic of occupational specialisation based on
  skilled trades. This is a result of workers being assigned to cells
  capable of several types of machining; the work-roles here, therefore,
  demand the capability to carry out a range of operations, some of
  which will require skills different from others. The degree of variety
  in the tasks associated with cell production served as the platform for
  one proponent of GT to link [its ] [use ] [with ] [job ] [enrichment ] [and ]
  socio-technics (Edwards, 1974a, 1974b).
   Despite being very fashionable as a technique for reorganising
  production in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Group Technology now
  is very much out of favour as a complete package. A survey of

```

-----

```
   machine shops in Britain showed that while NC has become popular,
    interest in GT has declined with some of those who showed some
    early enthusiasm for GT returning to a more conventional machine-
   shop layout. (Swords-Isherwood and Senker, 1978, p. 45). It is clear
   from the case studies presented by this survey that GT solved some
   problems (such as reducing throughput times) more than others (such
    as low machine utilisation and the costs of training skilled workers in
   several machining skills). Given the managerial complexities of
   planning the flow, grouping and sequence of products, as well as the
   loading of products between different cells, it is hardly surprising that
    the potentialities of GT proved hard to achieve in practice. However,
   with the increasing sophistication and reliability of NC it became
    possible to achieve some of the benefits that GT promised through
   reduced setting-up times. This did not remove the organisational
   problems of machine shops, which remained to be faced again later.
    It entailed a shift of focus from the organisational level to that of the
    individual machine. Hence the growth of multifunction machining
   centres where workpiece transfer could be eliminated. Put another
   way, the complex of problems involved in the transformation of
   small-batch manufacturing became seemingly more approachable by
   concentrating on the technological dimension. The wholesale reorga-
    nisation of machine shops demanded by GT along with the
   consequent costs of worker resistance, upheaval and likely price of
    failure, became avoidable much to the disgruntlement of GT
   proponents who attacked this as the result of a ‘failure in British
   management’ (Burbidge, 1978; Edwards, 1980).
     In the following section, then, we will describe changes in the
   technological dimension of small-batch engineering with flexibilities
    in machine-control systems constituting the important element.
   These technological developments, notably that of numerical control,
   occurred in parallel with Group Technology, although their wide-
   spread diffusion is a more recent and continuing phenomenon. It is
   only later, when attempts are made to link numerically controlled
   machinery into automated manufacturing systems that the full impact
   of these organisational problems recur. This time, however, the
   planning problems can be eased to a greater extent by the availability
   of computer-aided manufacturing systems (CAM). Also, the ration-
    alisation of product design brought about by the use of computer-
   aided design in the drawing office to customise standard product
   designs can aid the grouping of similar components for cell-based
   production in ‘Flexible Manufacturing Systems’.

  TERTIARY MECHANISATION OF MACHINE TOOLS
  In earlier chapters by tracing the development of Fordism, we noted
  particular characteristics in the development of Fordist mechanical
  control systems. By using mechanical fixtures (to hold the workpiece
  in the correct position for machining), jigs (to guide the cutting tools)
  and stops (to limit the depth and dimensions of cut) this tooling
  permitted certain work previously carried out by skilled workers to
  be performed by semi-skilled workers, but only after the machinery
  had been initially set up by the former. Furthermore, the factors of
  skill shortages and the need for increasing precision have been
  stressed in this account as significant elements of the ‘deskilling’
  dynamic besides economic considerations of labour costs. However,
  the rudimentary nature of such control mechanisms has restricted
  their use, in the main, to simple, repetitive operations. In the case of
  transfer lines, where such operations are carried out in succession,
  mechanised transfer devices have been used to move parts between
  the ‘dedicated’ machines.
   Yet for more complex work, involving a variety of products, the
  mechanisation of control systems on machine tools has taken a
  different path. Noble (1979) describes the history of such technolo-
  gies. In the 1930s and 1940s the use of tracer mechanisms involved
  the use of patterns or templates to guide the cutting tool, thereby
  reproducing the contour of the template in the workpiece. Here the
  self-acting nature of the machinery is not restricted to the production
  of identical, or very similar, items as is the case at Fordist control
  mechanisation. Changing the template permitted a different cut to be
  made, hence a significant degree of versatility was retained alongside
  machine-tool ‘automation’. However, the mechanical control
  mechanism was an early form of machine control. The drawbacks of
  producing templates and needing several of these for the different
  surfaces of the workpiece were eventually overcome by using
  electrical control mechanisms. The development of new electrical
  sensing and measuring devices, as well as precision servometers
  controlling mechanical motion (a development of gunfire control
  technology developed during World War Two) served as the
  technical means for this.
   Noble’s case-study examined one particular choice in the process of
  developing electrical control of machine tools. This was between an
  analogue form of programming, in which the machine recorded the
  initial machine motions made by the operator, and a digital form in

```

-----

```
   which the sequence and details of operations were specified
   numerically and stored usually on a punched paper tape. By
   replaying the programme, identical parts could be produced. In the
   ‘record-playback’ technology, programming was commensurate with
   the skills of existing machinists. With NC, however, these skilled
   operations need to be converted into a digital programming
   code — ‘parts programming’, as this procedure is called — and this
   dispenses with the manual controls of machining and so makes one
   aspect of the craft-skills redundant, namely what we have previously
   referred to as hand-eye co-ordination.
    As was noted earlier, Noble wishes to argue that the choice
   between these control technologies reflects the social relations of
   production. The ‘horizontal’ relations of production (for instance,
   between different firms) favour the development and use of NC over
   record-playback because the complexity and expense of the former
   favoured larger military contractors over smaller machining shops.
   The ‘vertical’ relations of production (that is, between capital and
   labour) were mirrored in the use of NC since this technology
   permitted deskilling. In this way Noble elucidates the choices in
   technological development and how the social relations of production
   of capitalism constantly precludes the development of other possible
    lines of technological change.
     It is not clear that the record-playback system did indeed perform
    as well as the NC system. As far as military requirements are
   concerned, NC seemed to them more appropriate to their require-
   ments, as Noble admits. Thus the complexity of aircraft parts, the
    possibilities of standardisation of programs (having strategic and
   cost-cutting value) and the potential which NC software held for
   rapid mobilisation and design change all mitigate against record-
   playback. What is more, the development of NC machinery does not
   inevitably lead to a distinct division of labour between programming
   and operating (Sorge et al., 1981; Jones, 1982a). Nor did the adoption
   of NC machinery preclude the later construction of NC machinery
   having record-playback characteristics (Marsh, 1981a, p. 545; Boon,
    1981).
    What numerically controlled (and for that matter record-playback)
   machine tools do represent, however, is a different form of
   ‘automation’ to the transfer line. The defining characteristics of this
   form of control lies in the ease of reprogramming the control system
    with different instructions to enable the machine to carry out
    different operations. What these technologies effectively achieve is a

```

```
  drastic reduction in the setting-up time of machine tools (which was
  of crucial importance in the implementation of GT). This reduction is
  a result of: (i), the ability to program (now comprising a major part of
  setting-up activity) off the machine — thereby reducing the ‘down-
  time’ when a machine is not utilisable for production; (ii), the ability
  to store a suite of tapes or programs from which a number of repeat
  items, or variations of these, may be easily made as required.
   The mechanisation of machine tools can be characterised in Bell’s
  scheme both in terms of the sophistication of control mechanisms and
  the mechanisation of handling (transfer and loading) functions as
  follows: the Figures 3.1 and 3.2 represent developments in the
  mechanisation of machine tools under two headings: the early 1960s
  and the 1970s. The major difference between the two lies in the
  sophistication of the control systems. In Figure 3.1, increased
  sophistication of this function in the period before the 1960s was
  generally accompanied by an increased inflexibility in operations and
  sequencing. After that time (Figure 3.2) newer systems of control
  were used which did not rely on the manual setting of dials, switches,
  stops and cams. Although some manual inputs are still necessary,
  different categories of electrical control system (numbered 5 to 8)
  raise further the level of control mechanisation. In this period,
  because setting-up began to take the form of programming — using
  plugboards, paper and magnetic tapes, or direct inputs from a
  computer (‘Computer Numerical Control’ —- CNC), it became pro-
  gressively easier to change the details of operations between different
  products.
   The two phases in the development of control mechanisation in
  metal-cutting machinery identified by Bell correspond closely to our
  distinction between Fordism and neo-Fordism. In the early phase,
  increased sophistication of control mechanisation, being accompa-
  nied by inflexibilities in machine operation, had to be associated with
  product standardisation and volume production. The latter phase is
  characterised by the progressive uncoupling of the level of mecha-
  nisation and the scale of production.
   Given this distinction, the effects of higher mechanisation in
  mechanical engineering is variable. Under Fordist mechanisation the
  relation between standardisation and the level of control mechanisa-
  tion has the effect of increasing the proportion of less skilled tasks.
  This is despite the contrary trend of increasing need for skilled
  tooling, setting-up and maintenance tasks, whilst in the case of the
  mechanisation of transfer (loading and handling) functions, it is not

```

   obvious what specific effect this will have since it is dependent on the
    actual division of labour as to whether skilled or semi-skilled labour is
   displaced.*
    Ultimately Bell noted that as a general rule the mechanisation of
    control displaces skilled tasks, whereas the mechanisation of transfer
   functions displaces unskilled tasks. Under Fordism, because of the
    link between scale and level of mechanisation, the overall effect is
   one of reduction in the proportion of skilled tasks and an increase in
    unskilled ones. In the newer, neo-Fordist phase of mechanisation,
    the potential effects of technical change on skill and work organisa-
    tion are much more difficult to identify. We have seen that this
    difficulty has led some writers to adopt a contingent model of the
    relation between technical change in machine tools and skill (Jones,
    1982a) or work organisation (Wilkinson, 1981). The eventual
   outcome of technological change is seen very much as the outcome of
    a process of negotiation surrounding the introduction of the
   technology.
    Examining Bell’s model of technical change in the 1970s (Figure
    3.2) he identifies four major levels of control mechanisation. Unlike
    Fordist mechanisation, successive developments in this dimension are
   accompanied by an increased versatility of the machine tool’s
   operations, resulting from the programmability of the control system.
   The limited nature of the memory, reducing the number of possible
   programs which are available from machines in category 5 is
   overcome in category 6. In this case the use of paper or magnetic tape
    allows a virtually unlimited memory, which is accessible by manually
    loading the requisite tape on to the machine. In category 7, the
   programs are stored in a computer memory which permits a more
    rapid access, and thus program change, although in all the cases the
   machine itself will still usually require changes in tooling between
    different programs. Further limitations to the versatility of the
    control system being realised result from the limited mechanical
    capabilities of the machine itself. For example, some machines are
   more suitable for particular types of operation than others by virtue
    of the range of tools or size of workpiece which can be accommo-
    dated. To an extent this has been overcome by the use of machining
    centres which have a wider range of tools and capabilities than
   ordinary lathes or milling machinery. Machining centres also have the
   advantage of overcoming the need to transfer workpieces between
    different machines since several operations can be performed on the
    one machine.

   Bell also described a variant of direct computer control (Category
  8) incorporating rudimentary sensory feedback capabilities. ‘Adap-
  tive’ control systems would monitor parameters such as workpiece
  dimensions, cutting speed, etc. and compensate for effects like
  variations in tool sharpness or the flexing of certain alloys during
  machining.
   When Bell carried out his study there were only a few examples of
  machines in categories 7 and 8 and most of these were still under
  evaluation. The majority of machines in use were those in categories
  S and 6. Hence he saw the general effect of NC machines as reducing
  the need for skilled workers as operators, by means of the separation
  of programming and operating. By extrapolation, the Direct
  Numerical Control (DNC) machines of categories 7 and 8 would
  amplify that effect, given that DNC, in most cases, consisted of a
  large central computer storing the NC programmes which were then
  routed electronically to an array of NC-input machines. The
  counter-effect to this though was in the mechanisation of handling,
  which would tend to displace less-skilled workers if they were
  previously carrying out these transfer functions. Where the latter
  functions were carried out by skilled workers (for example, loading
  and unloading their machines) then the usual effect would be to
  increase the skilled content of their work by removing unskilled
  handling functions. Ultimately then, Bell identified the likely
  direction of development in small-batch mechanisation as a central
  computer controlling NC-programmed machine-tools linked by
  transfer devices which allow flexible routeing of workpieces between
  the different machines. The net result of increasing mechanisation
  therefore, would be, first, a shift to using semi-skilled machinists on
 NC machines, followed by a reduction of the latter with the increased
  mechanisation of transfer culminating in an integrated manufacturing
  system, with few operators but an increased emphasis on planning
  and maintenance functions (Bell, 1972, p. 77).
   In this respect Bell’s scheme follows the predilection of many
  writers on technological change by extrapolating the labour-
  displacing effects of mechanisation to a labourless fully-mechanised
  production system. However as we have been at pains to point out,
  such a one-sided and determinist view of technological change hides
  the contradictory dynamics of the production of profitable com-
  modities. It severely compresses the process of diffusion of techno-
  logy during the short term, where severe over-capacity makes
  investment in such new technologies highly risky. In the longer term

```

    there are different options for the development of control mechanisa-
    tion other than one of the centralised control of highly integrated
   system as has been the goal at high levels of Fordist mechanisation
   such as in oil and chemical plants.
    As we have pointed out, there is no necessity for mechanisation to
    be as advanced along all dimensions of transformation, transfer and
    control. Since Bell’s work, decreases in the size and cost of computers
    in the last decade have led to the construction of NC machinery with
    integral computer control — ‘Computer Numerical Controlled’
   (CNC) machines. Such machinery does not have to incorporate a
   form of mechanised transfer facility in order to represent a
    substantial development in machining capability. Indeed for many
   operations the mechanisation of inter-machine transfer would be
    difficult. Whereas CNC can be used, like NC, with separate
   programmers and operators, CNC also allows the reintegration of
   operating and programming, greatly facilitating both editing and
   programming on the machine. CNC tools also go with the develop-
   ment of powerful software which can reduce the time taken to
    construct and ‘prove’ programs as well as to make modifications to
    existing programs. Computer Numerical Control machinery, then,
    has a capacity for decentralised usage which is very different from
   assumptions of central computer control characteristic of DNC
    systems. Now both modes of CNC usage can be found in practice,
   and CNC machines can themselves be linked to a central computer.
   So what factors influence the mode in which CNC is used?
     In a comparative study of the diversity of forms of work
   organisation associated with the use of CNC technology, Sorge et al.
    (1981) try to disentangle what they refer to as the different logics of
   CNC application. They note that these different logics are analyti-
    cally distinct but that they sometimes interact or conflict with each
    other. They are associated with these factors: company or plant size;
    batch size or time; type of cutting or machining; national institutions
    and habits of technical work, management and training; socio-
   economic conditions (for example, raw materials shortages, limita-
    tions to market size and slow growth).
    As plant and batch size increase they note a correlated increase in
    bureaucratic structure (that is, a separate planning department) and
    increased polarisation of skills (between operators and setters/
   programmers). The phenomenon is modified by the time it takes to
    write a program. In general, the greater this is, the more program-
   ming becomes differentiated from operating. They found that such

```

-----

```
  task differentiation had more to do with management’s attempts to
  achieve maximum utilisation of expensive machinery than the control
  benefits of using a separate programmer. Note also that the
  separation of planning and operating did not necessarily imply a
  polarisation of skills, because, where programming was complex and
  therefore took a lot of time, the machinery itself was often
  sophisticated (for example, multi-function machining centres) and
  required skilled operation. On simpler work where polarisation is
  more likely under NC, the sope of CNC for merging programming
  and operating functions becomes greater (Sorge et al., 1981, p. 6).
   National differences also were important. They noted a consist-
  ently greater use of shop-floor- and operator-programming in West
  Germany as compared with Britain. This is reflected in the selection
  of equipment and control system options which are appropriate to
  shop-floor- and operator-programming, as well as in significant
  national differences in training, labour levels and work organisation
  policies. For example, they found that in Germany, technician
  training took place after craftwork apprenticeships rather than
  separately. In Britain programming was more likely to be a
  white-collar occupation wheres in Germany rotation between
  machine-based and planning department programming occurred
  (Sorge et al., 1981, p. 8). This observation is in line with the findings
  of both Jones and Wilkinson that management’s attempts to separate
  programming and operating functions were a constant problem in
  Britain, being actually detrimental for such things as quality and scrap
  rates.
   By using CNC rather than NC machinery operator programming
  was made more feasible. This ‘technological capability’ of itself
  cannot account for the eventual organisation of work with CNC
  machinery, since CNC is also compatible with a separate program-
  ming and planning department, as is common with NC. It might be
  attractive, given the manifest diversity in forms of work organisation
  associated with CNC, to adopt a strong ‘shop-floor politics’ position
  arguing like Wilkinson that the eventual polarisation in skill and
 programming functions will depend on contestation between dif-
  ferent parties. To do this, however, would concede that the ultimate
  determination of the structure of the labour process occurs at such a
  level. Similarly, Jones’s analysis might lead us to expect a diversity of
  organisational forms as a result of the mutual interaction of product
  and labour markets, technology and labour organisation. However,
  even this broader spectrum of variables does not give any feeling for

```

```
   dominant directions in technological and organisational change.
   There seem to be no general trajectories of development, like that of
   Fordism, along which new technologies and forms of work organisa-
    tion are being directed. Yet if we take Sorge ef al.’s fifth factor — the
   socio-economic conditions of these changes, it becomes possible to
    relate these changes in the labour process to the broader political
   economy.
     In their analysis, Sorge et al. note the specific conditions of
   competition in mature Fordism which become associated with many
    large producers competing in large markets. Firms have increasingly
    had to cater for particular market niches rather than monopolising
    the large or mass markets available in the past phase of Fordist
    growth. Market expansion or increase in market share requires
    increased variety and technical change in products. More individual-
    ised and customised commodites increase the complexity and range
    of parts in production.
     This acceleration in product complexity could be most adequately
   accomplished by designing more complex parts and components. Yet
    the requirement would then exist for a much greater number and
   complexity of operations to be carried out to make each component.
   They point out that it is for this reason that the diffusion of CNC
   machinery has a qualitative importance over and above increased
   productiveness defined in a quantitative sense. Thus the relationship
   between technological change in machinery and change in products is
    an organic one which is difficult to express quantitatively in the form
    of economic cost per unit of output. The complexity and precision of
    metal-cutting made possible by CNC machines would have been
    difficult, if not impossible, to produce on conventional machinery
    without using highly specialised and costly tools (Sorge et al., 1981, p.
    11).
     This is not to under-estimate the significance of cost reduction with
   NC and CNC. In the previous section we noted that the economic
   importance of reduced setting-up time (including programming time)
   between different production runs along with the further economies
    attainable with smaller batch sizes was a result of reduced levels of
    stock and work-in-progress. We have argued that some effects similar
    to those claimed for Group Technology might also be claimed for
   CNC machinery. One recent example here which has attempted to
    forecast the potential effect of ‘flexible’ technologies on the
   economics of batch production is the work of Ayres and Miller
    (1981).

```

```
   Ayres and Miller analysed the returns of the 1977 US Census of
  Production for selected metal-working industries which are repre-
  sentative of the range of metal-forming processes (Table 6.1).
  Comparing these industries, in terms of value added (labour and
  capital goods cost) per unit of raw materials gives the unit processing
  cost per dollar of materials used for the different industries. The
  lowest cost ratio.in the group (0.6) for metal cans, an example of mass
  production, is less than one quarter that of ‘special dies and tools, jigs
  and fixtures’. That is, the small-batch industry spends over four times
  as much on capital and labour as the large-batch metal can industry
  per unit of output.
   If the difference in cost of materials processed in the various
  industries is taken into account, with some industries using high
  quality tool steel or expensive alloys while others only use ordinary
  carbon steel, they estimate that the unit costs are about ten times
  higher for custom production in a job-shop environment than they

    are for mass-production operations. (This figure is in line with the
   estimation made by Cook, 1975, and quoted earlier). Now, on the
    basis of assuming a two-thirds reduction (derived from a survey of the
    potential cost reductions resulting from technologies now in ex-
   perimental use) in the differential between unit costs of mass and
    batch production, they are able to compute the potential cost-savings
    of small-batch mechanisation. Taking into account the variation in
    the value of materials processed they estimate the final price
    reductions as in Table 6.2. The two-thirds reduction in processing
    costs reduces overall costs by anything from 7 to 30 per cent, being
    highest for those products most likely on the whole to be produced in
    smaller batches.
    The potential effect of this phase of neo-Fordist mechanisation,
    then, is a substantial reduction in the cost of products within the
    batch metal-working sectors. Along with the reduction in manufac-
    turing costs, there are also qualitative changes in the nature of
   products implying a significant role for new ‘flexible’ technologies in
    the transformation of small-batch engineering. The realisation of
    such a potential is a different matter. In order that the effective use of
    such computer-controlled machinery should be achieved, far-
   reaching changes in the organisation and administration of machine-
   shops are necessary. What is currently described as ‘Computer Aided
    Production’ (CAP) would have to cover technological, organisational
   and informational transformations in the present structure of
   machine shops. We can see examples of this process being attempted

  the dynamics of the transformation.
 COMPUTER-AIDED PRODUCTION
  Whilst most of the labour process studies of NC machinery have
  looked at the level of individual free-standing machines and the
  division of labour between programming and operating, there have
  been moves to create integrated metal-working systems. The
  integration of several separate machines by flexible mechanised
  transfer systems, using computer-controlled pallets or occasionally
  robots carrying individual workpieces, has led to the experimentation
  with Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS). Information technolo-
  gies are being used to plan and co-ordinate flows of materials, stock
  levels and production schedules, in what computer sellers call
  computer-aided manufacturing (CAM). At the design and drafting
  stage, where the specification of each product and its components
  takes place, information technologies have in use from the late 1960s.
  Such computer-aided design (CAD) systems, and CAM, represent
  the extension of mechanisation to conceptual work. Ambitious
  attempts to link all these systems together to form Computer-Aided
  Production (CAP), ‘Automated Small-batch Production’ (ASP)
  ‘Computer Aided Engineering’ or “CAD/CAM)” systems are also
  mooted. All these systems are in the process of development and so
  inevitably there must be some uncertainty as to their final configura-
  tions. Nevertheless, recent studies have drawn interesting conclu-
  sions as to the likely direction in which such systems will progress.
  Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS)
  In its simplest form, a flexible manufacturing system consists of
  several NC or CNC machines linked [by ][a ][flexible ] [transfer ] [mechanism ]

     In principle, the design of an FMS is relatively straightforward.
    Versatile, computer-controlled machine tools perform the required
    operations on different workpieces which are transferred between the
   machine tools by a transfer and loading system under central
   computer control. Although there are several examples of small-scale
    FMSs in operation, the attainment of advanced, unattended FMSs
    has been a goal of state-financed R & D in Britain (via the
   Automated Small-batch Production (ASP) programme of the De-
   partment of Industry), Japan (in the Unmanned Metal-working
    Factory (MUM) project under the control of the Ministry of
    International Trade and Industry) and in the USA the Air Force is
    funding a program called ICAM (Integrated Computer-Aided
    Manufacture).
     The model used here, or ‘technological dream’ as Noble might
    describe it, is that of an integrated engineering plant so highly
   mechanised as to resemble a continuous process plant. As one British
   government-sponsored committee enthused:

    Advanced, fully automatic (ASP) systems completely remove
    workers from the arduous side of production (tempo, noise, heat,
     fumes, danger, monotony) and raise them to the status of planners,
     controllers or supervisors — analogous to the development of the
     chemical processing industry. (ASP Committee Report, 1978, p. 4)
     Needless to say the timescale for realising such a ‘factory of the
    future’ has been rather under-estimated. Leaving organisational
   problems and, most important, economic viability to one side, the
    technological problems of such a major transformation in small-batch
   production are many and varied. These are not restricted to the
    integration of machinery and transfer systems. Limitations in the
    automaticity of CNC machine tools which favoured their use by
    skilled workers have not been overcome by adding mechanised
    transfer systems: problems such as tool wear, tool breakage,
   on-machine inspection, lubrication, coolants, disposal of swarf are
   stubborn problems in the mechanisation of small-batch production
    (Sims, 1982). In practice then, skilled human intervention is still
    required for production in a FMS.
    A major technological problem is that of reliability. The drawback
    of a completely integrated system is that if one component breaks
   down, the whole system may have to be stopped. Therefore, as well
    as trying to avoid this by improving the reliability of the constituent
   machinery, a degree of redundancy has to be built into the system.
   Work can then be re-routed around the affected machinery. A similar
    feature is necessary for maintenance and training purposes (Gerwin
   and Leung, 1980, p. 7). In any system, then, a balance has to be
    struck between redundancy, reliability and cost.
    There are still limitations to the actual flexibility of FMSs. Gerwin
   and Leung (1980, p. 15) distinguish six different types of flexibility:
    @ Mix Flexibility: processing at any one time a mix of different parts
     which are loosely related to each other in some way such as
     belonging to the same family.
    © Parts Flexibility: adding parts to and removing parts from the mix
     over time.
     ©@ Routeing Flexibility: dynamic assignment of machines; that is
     re-routeing a given part through the system if the machine used in
      its manufacture is incapacitated.
    @ Design Change Flexibility: fast implementation of engineering
     design changes for a particular part.

```

-----

```
  @ Volume Flexibility: handling shifts in volume for a given part.
   ®@ Customising Flexibility: processing different mixes of parts on
   different FMSs in the same company.
   Making FMSs flexible along all these dimensions would of course
  be expensive. Although only certain degrees of flexibility may be
  required at any one time, they found that the effect of market
  changes was to change the crucial aspects of flexibility demanded
  from the FMS. Whereas they argue for FMSs to be designed with
  ‘flexibility responsiveness’ in mind, it is clear that the more highly
  mechanised and integrated the FMS the less flexible it becomes.
   When consideration of reliability, quality monitoring and the need
  for sophisticated maintenance and trouble-shooting skills are also
  taken into account, the move towards large ‘Automated Small-batch
  Production’ systems becomes more problematic. We now find much
  more modest proposals put forward in, for example, the British ASP
  programme (Hollingum, 1980; Production Engineer, 1981; Sims,
  1982). The accent is on smaller, more simple systems.
   A recent survey (Computing, 14 October 1982) of the thirty-three
  flexible systems in the United States revealed that none were working
  to the operator’s complete satisfaction, a few apparently being
  downright ‘disaster areas’. Similarly a German study (Blumberg and
  Gerwin, 1981) argues that highly complex integrated systems such as
  these were as yet beyond the organisational [capacity ] [of ] [most ] [firms. ]
  Rather than the ideal of an ‘automated [factory’, ] [often ] [depicted ] [as ] [a ]
  ‘smoothly operating system [free ] [of ][human ] [variability ] [. ] . ., it may well
  be a nightmare of uncontrollable [problems ] [requiring ] [unanticipated ]

   point out that, as the complexity of the system increases it is often
   necessary for firms also to increase the amount of human
   intervention — thus partially reversing the trend towards ‘automa-
    tion’. They conclude that the majority of companies are likely to gain
   more success by using simpler technologies which may be gradually
    built up in complexity whilst still retaining human labour as an
    essential part of the production process. Boon (1981) comments that
    the rigidities and inefficiencies which result from increasing complex-
    ity of FMSs make them more appropriate for large firms having a
   highly rationalised product range. Smaller firms with more diverse
   products attain better economies in practice using skilled workers
   operating smaller FMSs or machining cells.
   CAD, CAM and CAP
    If FMSs are characterised by the attempt to realise a technological
    solution to machine utilisation and ‘throughput times’ in small-batch
   engineering. Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) is an attempt
    to effect an organisational and informational transformation. In
   small-batch production, we have suggested, all three of these aspects
    are interrelated. Solutions which focus on only some of these become
    beset by problems from the neglected aspects.
     If we examine the range of tasks and operations involved in
   running a machine shop (Figure 6.5), it becomes clear that the actual
    tasks of machining and transfer of materials are heavily dependent on
   prior organisational and informational tasks of work analysis and
   planning, production control, tool and workpiece availability. Simi-
    larly, the design of products and components including the produc-
    tion of drawings for use in machine programming and machining,
   ultimately determine the need for materials, tools and machinery.
   Changes in small-batch engineering are beginning to occur at these
   conceptual levels.
    We have defined neo-Fordism as a change in the organisational
   element of the labour process from an hierarchical to an informa-
    tional one. In Fordist production systems a bureaucratic and hier-
    archical supervisory structure is used to plan, co-ordinate and control
   production organised around the interrelated tasks of line-workers.
   Yet neo-Fordist modes of organisation involve some decentralisation
   of these functions. This form of organisation is only feasible within an
   overriding plan of production. In this sense, the informational
   dimension of production becomes central.

     The availability of computerised information or data-processing
    has permitted step-by-step changes in the informational activities of
    manufacturing firms. Nygaard and Fjalestad (1981) describe three
    stages in the development of corporate computer systems. In the first
    stage a large mainframe computer is installed in a ‘Computer
    Department’ and data from other departments of the organisation
    are collected and converted into the appropriate format to be
    processed in the central department. In the second stage the other
    departments are reorganised to fit around the data-processing
    requirements of the central computer. All departments now produce
    standardised data for the computer to process and act upon its
    standardised output. But in the third stage the walls between the
   Computer Department and the rest of the organisation are pene-
    trated by communication equipment — linking the Department’s
    equipment to local computers, electronic typewriters, video screens
    (with or without associated keyboards), analogue-to-digital conver-
    ters, etc., throughout the organisation. As they put it, ‘the
    organisation is infiltrated by computing equipment. It becomes a
    network of human beings, machines and information-processing
    equipment, linked together by an increasing proportion of electronic
    communication links and a decreasing proportion of human com-
    munication links’ (Nygaard and Fjalestad, 1981, p. 224).
     This process has been taking place for several years, and is thus not
    a new phenomenon associated with recent advances in micro-
    electronics. Since the mid-1960s, major firms have used centralised
    computerised data-processing (Stage 1) for such functions as wages,
    sales ledgers and inventory monitoring. These organisations are
    currently moving towards the establishment of common data bases as
    in Stage 2. The common data bases may then be accessed via remote
    ‘unintelligent’ terminals for a variety of functions.
     Where micro-electronics has had a major effect has been on
    reducing the cost of computer hardware. This has resulted in the
   development of ‘intelligent’ terminals, terminals with an in-built
    computer-processing capability. Such terminals may be dedicated to
    a particular use, such as planning production or material-
    requirements, but may be able to draw on the common data base for
    information as required. In some cases a central processor with a
    powerful computer can be shared between these terminals (‘distri-
    buted processing’). Nygaard and Fijalestad refer to these latter
    developments as the third stage in the structural development of
    corporate computer systems. Essentially this third stage represents

```

```
 the beginning of a thorough transformation of the conceptual
 functions of production.
   In the case of design and drafting, the conventional routine consists
 of a designer or drafting worker drawing a product or component and
 the resulting drawing, with details such as sizes, materials finish, etc.
  will be distributed to machinists, NC parts programmers, project
 engineers and methods engineers. They, in turn, have to interpret
  these drawings, extracting the relevant information for their own
 purposes. The resulting information will then be translated into
 production schedules, NC programs, raw material requirements and
 tooling needs, which are used to organise various elements of
 production.
  The first part of this process, designing and drafting, has been the
  site of increasing use of computer-based graphics systems. Initially,
  these were limited to large mainframe computers (as used in Stage 1),
 and thus were expensive systems to buy and use, which restricted
 them to high value sectors such as aerospace and electronic circuit
  design, and mass-production sectors like motor vehicles.
 Mini-computers and micro-computers, by lowering the cost of hard-
  ware, along with cheaper storage display tubes and powerful
  software permitted a reduction in cost of Computer Aided Design
  systems. It became economically feasible for mini- and micro-
 computer-based CAD systems to be used in other sectors of
  engineering.
  Whereas CAD systems have become more sophisticated in recent
  years, having capabilities such as rudimentary three-dimensional and
  solids modelling and incorporating statistical procedures to analyse
 such things as stress factors, these do not account for the most
 widespread use of CAD. CAD might be better thought of as
 computer-aided-drafting, since it is in this mode that most existing
 systems are used (Arnold and Senker, 1982). This is especially the
  case for small-batch engineering, given its lag behind other sectors of
 engineering in the use of CAD.
  CAD is particularly appropriate in small-batch engineering for the
 modification and manipulation of existing designs, more than for
 designing entirely new products. In this resepct the use of CAD
  facilitates the customising of products — a feature that characterises
 much of the work of the mechanical engineering industry — as well as
 reducing lead-times for new orders. The diffusion of CAD seems to
 have been accelerated by the shortage of drawing-office labour,
 which was common until very recently. In the recent past, and more

```

-----

```
    so in any future period of expansion. CAD will be a technological
   substitute for the lack of skilled workers rather than an attack on
    existing ones. What is more likely, according to Arnold and Senker,
    is that drawing-office workers without a knowledge of engineering
   gained on the shop-floor will be most at risk from CAD; this in turn
   threatens the training route, and therefore the supply of more
   experienced CAD operators in the future (Arnold and Senker, 1982,
    p. 35).
    Where firms have attempted economic calculations to justify the
   introduction of CAD, this is often done on the basis of labour
   displacement. It is not clear, though, that labour costs are the most
    relevant consideration. Factors which influenced many managers in
    their decision to press for a CAD facility were related to competition.
    Better presentation of tenders, shorter lead-times, the need for
    increasingly complex products, the ease of meeting customers’
   product requirements, increased accuracy and clarity of drawings all
   proved to be important but unquantifiable aspects of the diffusion of
   CAD. As we have already said, this is a crucial aspect of the forms of
   competition under neo-Fordism: heterogeneity in product markets
   and technological competition (in both products and production
    processes) replace the large homogeneous mass markets and rela-
    tively stable products of the oligopolistic Fordist phase of accumula-
    tion. The cost-saving justification of labour displacement may appeal
    to accountants during a depression. Yet the ability to expand in an
   upturn and survive competitively against other capitals demands
    counter-cyclical investment and the implementation of, and experi-
    ence with, CAD systems before any such upturn.
    Computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) refers to the use of
   computer systems to control the operations of a manufacturing plant.
   Referring back to Figure 6.5, these systems are directed towards the
    control of work analysis and planning and production control as well
    as tool and workpiece availability. In addition, CAM systems can be
    linked to CAD systems (CAD/CAM) where the output of the CAD
   system includes instructions for the manufacture of a designed
   product or component. This refers especially to CAD-generated
   programs for CNC machine tools. It can also cover other aspects
    of production organisation.
    At present, few companies in small-batch engineering are any-
   where near the construction of integrated CAD/CAM systems
    (Arnold and Senker, 1982). Where such systems do exist, such as in
   aerospace manufacture, the highly sophisticated machinery necessary

```

-----

```
  is SO expensive as to remove it completely from the ambit of most
 small and medium-size mechanical engineering establishments. In
 companies implementing CAM systems which are not linked to
 CAD, the problems of organisational structure become most
 pronounced. Such systems demand a well-ordered and rational
 product-flow system which can be modelled on a computer data-base.
 As one metal worker from a GEC factory put it: ‘you can’t
 computerise chaos’ (Manchester Employment Research Group,
  1983). In such cases, the necessary organisational changes, which
 have been ignored in favour of technological solutions to the costs of
 small-batch production reveal themselves to managements in the
 form of production bottlenecks.
  The problems involved in the informational reorganisation associ-
  ated with CAM are crucially dependent on the difficulties of ‘data
  capture’, that is, linking the model of the production process in the
 computer system to the real process of production on the shop-floor.
 Whereas computer systems are extremely adept at the storage and
 manipulation of data, this is only effective where there is a continual
 updating of the model by means of the interface between computer
 and shop-floor. The use and reliability of the information system is
  ultimately dependent on the quality and speed of information which
  it receives. Hence, unless automatic forms of work and machine-
  function monitoring are devised, along with automated quality
  control systems, the functioning of the CAM system is very much
 dependent on manual updating [of ] [the ] [database. ] [Hence, ] [despite ] [the ]
  valid concern expressed by labour-process writers with the potential
  of information systems for monitoring [the ] [work ] [pace ] [of ] [workers ]
 (CSE Micro-electronics Group, [1980) ] [the ] [phenomenon ] [is ] [double- ]
  edged. The greater threats of [such ] [systems, ] [in ][fact, ] [are ] [to ] [the ] [jobs ] [of ]
  supervisory workers carrying [out ] [production ] [planning ] [functions, ] [as ]
  well as those of progress chasers [and ] [time-study ] [people ] [whose ]
  functions the information system can usurp.
  Although in an early phase of development a particular attraction
 which CAM systems offer is harnessing the knowledge and experi-
  ence of shop-floor workers in the day-to-day running of the firm. The
  latter situation is the hope which Friedman (1977) discerned in
  responsible autonomy strategies on the part of ‘enlightened manage-
  ment’. The compatibility of information systems co-ordinating
 semi-autonomous groups has been noted earlier as a strand in
 progressive management thought. The extent to which information
  systems associated with CAM are structured to enable managements

    to monitor crucial parameters of the overall ‘decentralised’ produc-
    tion process is paramount here.
   CONCLUSION
   What general conclusions can be drawn from this overview of
   technological and organisational developments in relation to the
   transformation of small batch engineering? First, it is apparent that
    whilst managers and engineers might wish to direct their efforts
   towards integrated, ‘workerless’ systems, the problems of integration
   founder on the partial nature of ‘automation’ in the individual
   components. So, problems of reliability arise from the lack of
   adequate means of monitoring and compensating for tool wear, for
   example in NC metal-cutting machine tools. Adding on flexible
    transfer systems can do little to resolve this problem. The result can
    be unreliability and extremely expensive systems lying idle for long
    periods.
     Similarly, there are also the organisational problems of catering for
   modifications in production plans and changes in product mixes
    within highly mechanised systems, whose degree of flexibility may be
    high but not infinite. The degree of control over production (let alone
    over workers) which such informational systems can provide is
   therefore curtailed. These systems must thus be recognised as
    indicative rather than controlling in nature. Their viability relies
    ultimately on the quality of information supplied to the system both
   by machines and workers and the usefulness of the new information
   generated, whether in the form of a production schedule or a
   machine program.
     It has been suggested that the end result of these attempts to
   transform small batch engineering into CAP systems is likely to differ
   from the grandiose claims of some of its most futurist protagonists.
   This is not to deny that a high degree of technical change is probable,
    but the likelihood of the fully mechanised, ‘workerless’ factory being
    the end-point of that change is similar to that of Group Technology
   forming the organisational answer to productivity bottlenecks in
   small-batch engineering. The practical result of the ‘vision’ will be
    different from the intentions of its promoters. In the case of
   small-batch engineering, rather than a centralised, highly mechanised
   system, the result is likely to take the form of tighter organisational
    control over production, but with workers exercising a relatively high

```

-----

```
 degree of autonomy and skill at a local level. As the capital intensity
 of CAP systems is high, the premium for skilled labour is marginal
 compared to the cost of inefficient usage of capital equipment. So,
 rather than cutting labour costs by deskilling, as in Fordism, the
 inducement in neo-Fordist batch production systems is the efficiency
 of capital utilisation. This is aided by skilled operators more than
 unskilled machine minders.
  These comments may go against the stream of engineering
 orthodoxy if one judges by articles in the technical press, but they
 reflect the fact that many of the ‘workerless’ factories are ex-
 perimental, pilot or showpiece systems and rely on large amounts of
 state funding, often from military sources (see Financial Times, 3
 November 1983). Nevertheless, taking a longer-term view, explora-
 tions of the technologies for such factories, whatever success they
 have as whole systems, will result in the development of partial
 technological and organisational competences. Subsequently, these
 can be successfully incorporated into smaller and simpler systems,
 where the levels of mechanisation and degrees of integration are
 lower. That there are economic and technological problems with full
 systems does not mean that small batch engineering is forever
 immune from productivity increases.°
  To conclude: in this chapter we have reviewed various develop-
 ments, both technological and organisational, in small-batch en-
 gineering and discussed how the problems of a straightforward
 application of Fordist principles of production organisation to that
 sector are being transcended by recent technological developments in
 the ‘informational’/‘control’ dimension of mechanisation. We showed
 that the technological, organisational and informational principles on
 which production processes in small-batch engineering are being
 based marks a break with Fordism as we have defined it. By
 extension, in order to realise the potential of information technolo-
 gies, to ensure an historic increase in productivity in small-batch
 capital goods manufacture and, in turn, contribute to a long-term
 upswing in economic growth in capitalist economies, would take a
 successful combination of neo-Fordist [production ] [process ] [elements, ]
 the technological, the work organisational [and ] [the ] [informational. ] [We ]
 return to this in Chapter 8.

  7 Information
   Technologies, the Service
   Sector and the
   Restructuring of
   Consumption
   INTRODUCTION
    As we first outlined in Chapter 2, information technologies are
    applicable not only to such manufacturing sectors as small-batch
   engineering but also to other sectors which have traditionally proved
    very difficult to organise on Fordist lines. In particular, this includes
    those sectors which have not been based on the use of much
    sophisticated machinery, either in terms of transformation, transfer
    or control. We refer to the application of information technologies in
    the supply and production of so-called ‘services’ to which this chapter
    is devoted. The chapter examines this sector to see whether
    neo-Fordist developments can be identified. After looking at what
    the service sector actually comprises, we examine various organisa-
    tional changes that have taken place in one part of the sector that has
    been most affected by developments in computer technology since
    the 1950s — clerical work. We wish to develop the idea that
    information technologies being introduced into such work in the
    1980s are best seen as associated with neo-Fordist organisational
    changes.
    We will also seek to demonstrate that the concept of neo-Fordism
    cannot be confined merely to describing some transition within
    existing service industries or occupational sectors. Indeed the
    promise of information technologies, their recasting of traditionally
    labour-intensive activities of information handling, implies a substan-
    tial reorganisation of the existing service industries themselves, as the

```

-----

```
  patterns of service consumption amongst the population alters. Just
  as Fordism for its extension to a large number of industries, required
  a reorganisation of the consumption patterns of the majority of the
  population so, we would argue, might neo-Fordism, though not
  necessarily of the same kind nor on the same scale. In other words,
  for a successful capitalist exploitation of information technologies,
  fairly substantial changes may be required in the way people in
  developed capitalist countries satisfy their needs. In the second half
  of this chapter we discuss this restructuring of consumption using
  possible changes in the ways in which health care is provided as an
  example.
  THE SERVICE SECTOR
  The service industries provide many of the prerequisites for the
  functioning and growth of capitalist economies. Many are concerned
  with the distribution of goods and raw materials, the circulation of
  capital, the production and reproduction of labour power and the
  provision of information and expertise. Many of these service
  industries are particularly labour-intensive and in all developed
  countries a large proportion of services are provided by the state
  rather than by private capital. Much of the non-state-financed service
  industries consist to a large extent of small capital and the
  self-employed. In contrast to manufacturing industries, few of the
  service industries have significant transnational capital, although this
   is beginning to change.
   As the current economic crisis has continued, reductions in state
  expenditure on service industries along with the search — especially
  amongst equipment manufacturers — for new markets, has made the
  service industries very attractive targets for capitalisation. Similarly,
  the current contraction of the private manufacturing sector in many
  countries has forced service contractors to look to the state sector for
  growth especially in such areas as catering, cleaning and security.
   The services do not clearly exist as a sector, they are a
  heterogeneous collection of industries. The main thing they have in
  common is that their ‘products’ are not in the main physical goods but
   are in some way intangible, impermanent and immaterial. A lot of
  ink has been spilt in attempting some embracing definition of what
  constitutes the service sector, much of it wasted by trying to bring
  unity to what is better left as diversity.' Gershuny and Miles (1983)

```

-----

```
    have pointed out that the definitions are of limited value since the
    term ‘services’ has at least four meanings.
     There are certainly service industries which provide the immaterial
    service products as well as physical products which have been
    transformed by such service activity. Such industries include the
    familiar, and sometimes overlapping, categories of tertiary industries
    (transport, communications, utilities), personal services (hair-
    dressers, dentists, catering etc.), goods services (maintenance of cars,
    consumer goods and buildings, etc.), producer services (finance,
    banking, legal and research work), cultural industries (publishing,
    broadcasting, advertising, etc.) and public services (education, health
    and public administration). But many of the service products of these
    industries are also produced by manufacturing industries who offer
    them for sale (for example, computer manufacturers who offer
    maintenance services) or who consume them internally to their own
    organisation (for example, some firms have their own transport
    departments). So, service workers, people who actually produce the
    service products, are distributed across all industries, ‘service’ and
    manufacturing. In addition, it is necessary to identify service
    functions, necessary human requirements, or ‘needs’, which can be
    satisfied in a number of historically specific and changing ways. (For
    example, the human need to move from place to place can be
    satisfied by the transport service industry of buses and trains or by the
    self-drive physical products of the automobile manufacturing
    industry).
     Exactly how the changing mode of satisfaction of various human
    service functions is linked to changes in the structure of service
    industries and employment is an important question. We will return
    to it later in considering the applications of information technologies.
    For the moment, let us note that Gershuny and Miles divide services
    into a number of categories thus:
     1. MARKETED SERVICES — namely service products which are
     provided in advanced capitalist countries predominantly by
      private capital via competitive markets. These include:
      (a) Producer services — provided in the main to and for the
         capitalist- and state-production sectors rather than to indi-
         vidual consumers; namely:
       Finance — banking, credit, insurance, real estate, etc.
       Professional — legal, research, advertising, etc.
        Other business — cleaning, security, maintenance, etc.

```

-----

```
    (b) Distributive services provided to and for capital- and state-
      organisations for the transfer and storage of people, goods
      and information of all kinds; namely:
      Transport, storage — the physical movement and storage of
      goods and people by road, rail, air and water
     Communications — the physical and electronic transfer of
      letters, Speech, financial and other data by postal, telephone
      and computerised services
      Wholesale and retail trades — that is, the sale and trading of
      manufactured goods and of personal services
    (c) Personal services — the provision of services direct to house-
      holds or individuals or to households and individuals’ posses-
       sions; namely:
     Domestic — the performance of domestic activities such as
      cleaning, laundry, personal care (for example, hairdressing)
      Lodging and catering — the provision of hotels and restaurant
      services
      Repairs — the servicing of household durables and of domestic
      buildings
      Entertainment and recreation — the provision of sports, arts,
      and general leisure/cultural services outside and, by cable,
       etc., inside the household
   2. NON-MARKETED SERVICES —- namely service products
    which tend to be provided by state-owned, state-financed and/or
    state-administered organisations in advanced capitalist countries;
    namely:
    Health care — the services of doctors, other hospital workers,
    dentists, etc. within ‘health services’
    Education — education and training services offered by nurseries,
    schools, and higher and further educational institutes
    Other welfare — personal social services (for example, social
    work), surveillance (policing) and other general government
    services (for example, public administration, communal cleaning).
   We cannot go into the likely significance of innovations in
  information technology in all these service activities. Table 7.1
  presents a summary of some of the most probable developments.
   The concern of many writers to chart and quantify the growth of
  the services over the post-war period reflects their view that
  developed countries are moving to a ‘post-manufacturing’ or, less
  precisely, ‘post-industrial’ phase of development. In this phase, it is

    said, the dominance of manufacturing employment becomes more
    and more eclipsed by the growth of the service sector as the major
    source of employment. This is seen historically to mirror the decline
    of employment in primary industries of agriculture and extraction.
   However, the post-industrial thesis of the early and mid-1970s has
    been challenged by events in more recent times. The idea that
   manufacturing would become almost completely mechanised, leaving
    labour-intensive work in the service industries or (if much less so) in
    the service occupations of manufacturing, to take up the slack,
   assumed a low level of labour-saving technological change in services.

```

-----

```
  (This low level may have been due to the sheer technical difficulty of
 mechanising service tasks, the low pay of most service workers or the
  deliberate job-creating policies of inverventionist governments in the
 public sector.) It is clear now that this is not in fact likely to be the
  case, both because new technological developments can indeed
 mechanise many service tasks and because the prevailing economic
 and political situation discourages an extension of public, labour-
 absorbing services.
   Yet while the optimistic social commentators of post-industrialism
  were replacing their vision of the ‘service society’ by a rather similar
  notion of an information society (this being a society where
  information is the dominant commodity being traded rather than
 manufactured goods)* other, pessimistic commentators foresaw the
  effects of information technology in services leading to a major
  shake-out of service workers in the so-called white-collar jobs
  (Jenkins and Sherman, 1979; Hines and Searle, 1979). The common
  thrust of these arguments was that there was likely to be a large
  degree of surplus labour—engaging either in ‘leisure’ or
  unemployment — depending on such matters as the policies of both
  the state and individual firms on job-sharing and, more vaguely,
  changing attitudes to the presumed ‘work ethic’. The rising numbers
  of unemployed in developed societies from the late 1970s seemed to
  indicate confirmation of these trends.
   Although few people would argue now that the high level of
 unemployment in the advanced capitalist countries is a direct result of
  the introduction of new technology in manufacturing and services,
  the present orthodoxy is that any upturn in the economy would result
  in jobless growth certainly in manufacturing [and, ] [most ] [probably, ] [in ]
  many services. While much of [this ] [writing ] [has ] [been ] [the ] [stimulus ] [to ]
  debates on the effects of new technology, [few ] [commentators ] [have ]
  been sensitive to the constraints [of ][political ] [economy, ] [the ] [barriers ] [to ]
  increased mechanisation especially [in ] [the ] [services, ] [or ] [the ] [emerging ]
  patterns of technological and [organisational ] [change ] [both ] [within ] [and ]
  between sectors.
   Of course there are enormous difficulties in discerning technologi-
  cal and social trends at the level of the service sector as a whole just as
  it is difficult to talk about general trends in manufacturing as a whole
  rather than in specific industries. Yet as soon as we move from the
  aggregate to the level of particular industries and types of service, the
  multiple dynamics of service industries become easier to see. Recent
  work (Robertson et al., 1982; Gershuny, 1983; Gershuny and Miles,

```

```
    1983) has examined the main locations of growth in_ service
    industries. Over the post-war period around two-thirds of service
    industry growth is accounted for by the growth of state services,
    especially administration, education, welfare and, except in the case
    of the USA where it is mostly privately run, medicine. Most of the
    other one-third of post-war growth is accounted for by the expansion
    of producer services. This expansion is, in part, a reflection of the
    increasingly complex social division of labour in the production of
    goods and of the increasing importance of non-direct, conceptual
    tasks in contemporary manufacturing. (From 1924 to 1975, the
    proportion of administrative, technical and clerical workers in British
    manufacturing industry went up from just over 10 per cent to about
    28 per cent; see Crum and Gudgen, 1978.) In aggregate terms there
    has been a relatively stable or slightly declining level of employment
    in the marketed services in developed capitalist societies. Especially
    in the cases of entertainment, transport and domestic services,
    growth in consumption in these areas to satisfy these service functions
    has been achieved through the purchase of goods like cars, television
    and domestic appliances.
     As we have said, another way of characterising this service work is
    in terms of occupational categories. This has the advantage of
    capturing service work which does not take place in service industries
    as such. By defining service industries as concerned with the
    production of intangible products, as distinct from manufacturing
    production, such a definition neglects the dependence of a sizeable
    part of manufacturing activity on a variety of indirect servicing tasks,
    often, but not always, taking place in offices. These are an essential
   component of the production of the physical product: in Chapter 6, in
    the case of small-batch engineering, we described the work of design,
    planning, stock control, cost-accounting and progress-chasing which
    are non-direct production activities but are nevertheless essential to
    overall production. Increasing in importance are other white-collar
    functions within the manufacturing sector: marketing, research and
    development (R & D), purchasing, distribution, corporate finance
    and administration. This is in addition to indirect services such as
    plant and building maintenance, catering and cleaning. In this sense,
    a more adequate coverage of services is gleaned from service
    occupations rather than service industries despite the current
    trend for many services to be hived off or subcontracted from service
    firms.
     In the rest of this chapter then we seek to focus on some specific

 service industries and occupations to illustrate some of the develop-
 ments within which information technologies might be implicated.
 CLERICAL INDUSTRIES
 Information Technologies in the Office
 Office machinery and computers, along with the telecommunications
 systems and associated software needed to operate these elements
 and link them together, collectively known as ‘information technol-
 ogy’ (IT), are certainly of great applicability to all service sectors.
 Indeed for many, IT will turn those services from highly labour-
  intensive, paper-shifting, minimal technology activities into fully-
 fledged tertiary mechanised industries, with massive leaps in labour
 productivity in a comparatively short period of time — hence the
  analogies which some writers draw with the Industrial Revolution
  which involved similar leaps for some manufacturing industries,
  cotton spinning in particular.
   Consider, for example, the simple process of composing, typing
 and sending off a letter, say from some headquarter order depart-
 ment to a customer in response to an enquiry. Envisaged as a
 sequential process, the activity can be portrayed as in Figure 7.1.
  The squares represent transformation processes in which, by hand
 and brain, words are conveyed to paper either for the first time or in
 correction. The various paper drafts are transferred, between author
 and typist and clerical assistant, entirely by hand up to the postal
 stage where their transfer to the recipient may be accomplished by
 mechanical means, either in sorting or in transport. Until recently,
 the technological component of these clerical labour processes was
  limited to dictaphones, typewriters, franking machines, post office
 sorting machines and motor and rail vehicles. Electronic office
 machinery and advanced telecommunications makes it possible
 (although over what timescale is disputed) to eliminate many of these
 steps in transformation and in transfer, as well as in some aspects of
 the control of transformation (for example, layout, pagination)
 embodied in the actions of skilled typists, by ‘electronicising’ the
 entire process after the initial data entry involved in typing. With
 automatic voice transcription devices, it has been suggested, there
 can be further reduction as even the necessity for typing is removed.°

 The manipulation of the text of the letter, its permanent storage and
 its transfer to the customer become highly mechanised in all three
 dimensions with few places left for any need of human intervention
 after the initial composing and data entry actions.
  Although such equipment is being installed at a brisk pace in the
 offices of some companies, the rate of diffusion must not be
 exaggerated. Office equipment manufacturers, as might be expected,
 forecast that fully integrated systems —the so-called electronic
 office — will rapidly diffuse into the larger offices over the next five
 years; but, as we pointed out in Chapter 2, the speed of diffusion
 depends on many factors, most particularly the presence of an
 adequate advanced telecommunications infrastructure to handle
 what would be a huge increase in the electronic transmission of
 words, data and graphics. Such infrastructures are being installed on
 a world-wide level and they make up the technological core of current
 political disputes over European state telecommunications author-
 ities which are being dismembered in order to clear the way for
 international corporations to take over the long-distance national and
 international trunk lines. In contrast to the local telecommunications
 infrastructure these are very profitable and are especially used by
 large, often transnational, business users for corporate communica-
 tion and data flows. The enormous problems of infrastructural
 provision (such as, who pays for cable TV? how can privacy be
 protected?) and equipment incompatibility beween systems of rival
 producers means that the arrival of the electronic office is not as
 imminent as the manufacturers would have us believe. A further
 problem arises from the advantages of cost, durability and portability
 which paper has over electronic communications equipment, as well
 as its being the already existing medium. The information technology
 ‘poor’ will use paper for a long time to come, hence it will be a rare
 office that turns out to be ‘paperless’. In addition, even if some parts
 of the clerical production process are mechanised, the initial
 preparation of documents in the creative act of composition will still
 be a highly skilled, professional ‘craft’.
  Many commentators have seen the introduction of computerised
 office machinery — particularly the electronic word-processor — as
 the latest and most substantial extension of a long process of
 introducing Fordism into office work. In the rest of this section we
 examine this view. We shall argue that straightforward Fordist
 reorganisation of clerical work around information technologies will
 be confined (as it has been in the past) to those types of clerical work

    where standardisation of the clerical product is easiest. For clerical
    activities of high variety however — and it is these which have the
    lowest labour productivity — information-handling devices like word
    processors and telecommunication networks, although permitting
    some standardisation and reorganisation of work structures, are more
    limited in their effects and in this respect must be examined in
    different terms. As with our analysis of small-batch engineering
    developments we prefer to see the differences as constituting a
    different form of production process, namely neo-Fordism. As
    defined in Chapter 5, neo-Fordism is intended to describe processes
    displaying technological developments in control mechanisation
    which permit high variety in their transformative capacity, organisa-
    tional changes which favour less hierarchical work-roles and an
    informational infrastructure which can integrate different sub-units of
    the production process to permit various forms of decentralisation.
    The information technologies that can be employed in offices favour
    such informational infrastructures since they permit the rapid on-line
    manipulation of all sorts of data.
    Fordism in Office Work
    (This section and the one immediately following draw extensively on
    Softley, 1984.) Offices of varying sizes are found in all branches of
    production but it has been in service industries with large amounts of
    clerical work, indeed where the service is the processing of all forms
    of paper (orders/receipts/money) where the most successful attempts
     to emulate Fordist forms of manufacturing organisation have taken
    place. The best examples of this are banking, insurance and
    mail-order administration. In his discussion of the history of office
    work, Braverman describes its reorganisation over the last sixty years
     as leading to the creation of: ‘A stream of paper ... which is
    processed in a continuous flow like that of the cannery, by workers
    organised in much the same way’ (1974, p. 301). Strassman (1982)
    refers to this as the ‘classical organisational structure’ in which
    ‘standardised management, using standard operations concepts,
    imposes standard operating procedures on its employees’ to satisfy
    customers with ‘standard tastes and standard purchasing habits’.
     Such standardisation has been underway since the turn of this
    century. As offices grew in size, efficient decision-making processes
    became more and more crucial to the successful functioning of the

```

-----

```
 enterprise. Rationalisation served to centralise this decision-making,
 which became increasingly identified with the management role.
 Fordist techniques, although first applied in manufacturing, began in
 the 1930s to be emulated in office work. Standardisation of work
 procedures, the reorganisation of office layout more on flow-line
 principles, and time and motion studies, were introduced as a means
 of increasing efficiency and productivity. Planning and co-ordination
 became centralised, thus removing decision-making from the lower
 levels of clerical work and forming the technical basis of management
 authority. Thus this attempt at Fordist rationalisation went hand in
 hand with the growth of the management role, even though levels of
 mechanisation were very low, being restricted to the typewriter,
 telephone and dictating machines.
  This rationalisation partly resulted in the division between typing
 and secretarial work through the formation of typing pools. In Britain
 typing pools existed as early as the late 1880s, although it was not
 until the dictaphone came into widespread use in the 1920s that
 typing pools became the most common working arrangement for
 typists (Benet, 1972). A dictaphone allowed the physical separation
 of those who dictate from those who carry out the transcription from
 tapes, the audio-typist. Centralisation of the typing function within
 the organisation was believed to increase overall productivity,
 particularly that of the typists themselves.
  Of course there is a considerable variety in clerical work in which
 each document may require some different processing. The low
 machine intensity remained until the 1960s when xerography and
 computers began to come into routine use.* These factors limited the
 applicability of Fordist standardisation techniques for increasing the
 productivity of office work over and above that gained by increasing
 the intensity of work through application of the division of labour.
 Attempts to standardise office work were therefore limited in their
 extent; Braverman is forced to point [this ] [out, ] [even ] [against ] [the ] [thrust ]
 of his own argument:
  The work processes of most offices are readily recognisable in
  industrial terms as continuous flow processes. In the main they
  consist of a flow of documents required to effect and record
  commercial transactions, contractual arrangements, etc. While the
  processes are punctuated by personal interviews and correspon-
  dence, these serve to facilitate the flow of documentation. (Braver-
  man, 1974, p. 312, emphasis added)

```

-----

```
     The relative applicability of Fordist standardisation is plainly
    linked to the type of office work in question. The most successful
    types are undoubtedly the clerical industries. As has been said, in
    these offices the major activity is the processing of large volumes of
    information, often in a limited range of formats. So the major
    technique for the standardisation of inputs — buffering the internal
    bureaucratic systems and clerical labour process — is the use of forms.
    Application forms, order forms, cheques, etc., are all a result of the
    demand for an input in a format which will match the standard
    operations of the clerical labour process.
     An addition to standardisation as a means of increasing the
    productivity of office work, although coming much later, has been
    the introduction of mainframe computers for electronic data process-
    ing (EDP) which became a commercial reality for most office work
    during the 1960s. In 1965 eighty-eight local authorities in Britain had
    access to a computer for administration. By 1976 the number had
    reached 260. Housing records, payrolls, accounts, engineering and
    architectural data and police records were put on computers. In
    banking, EDP lowered the cost of work, reduced labour levels and
    the high error rate, and, importantly, allowed more effective
    managerial control. Leavitt and Whisler (1958) had predicted that
    computers, by increasing the speed and quality of information from
    low to top management, would weaken the power and authority of
    middle management. Control of the organisation would thus be
    centralised. Several later empirical studies supported this view of
    Dale’s:°
     As the machines [computers] increase in number and complexity,
     they give rise to further division of labour to add to those which,
      originally, they were called in to implement. Their costs rise and as
      institutions become larger there is a strong tendency towards
     centralisation; the physical aspect of the office becomes more like
      that of a factory department and the nature of the routine changes
     from purely clerical to the manual or technical. (Dale, 1962, p. 81)
     However, there have been other views. Withington (1969) argued
     that computerisation only resulted in greater centralisation in routine
    areas, such as data processing, and that the tendency toward
    increasingly complex managerial heirarchical structures was not
    observed. Instead, some argued that computerisation would promote
     decentralisation of line responsibility (Likert, 1961). Individual

 offices that had an on-site computer, rather than having on-line
 access to the mainframe at head office, it was observed, had a greater
 local management autonomy and less centralised corporate auth-
 ority. So, as the price of computers came down in the 1970s, it was
 Suggested that as many more plants acquired their own computer
 facilities this would ‘not lead to centralisation but foster greater
 structural complexity and more autonomy at the plant level’ (Blau ef
 al.) 1976, ‘p. 37).
  These accounts of decentralisation tend to confuse the notion of
 decentralisation of decision-making over an extremely narrow range
 of issues with the relocation of power and control over the way an
 organisation is run. As Crompton and Reid (1982) point out,
 ‘decision-making does not of itself necessarily provide a reliable
 indicator of the location of power’. Instead, they argue, it is the
 ‘capacity to influence or determine the premises upon which
 decisions are made’ which is a more reliable indication of centralisa-
 tion or decentralisation of power in an organisation. Thus, those
 studies that argue that EDP-type computerisation has promoted
 multi-level hierarchies and decentralisation of authority, neglect the
 fact that decentralisation of some decision-making functions may
 coexist with increasing centralisation of other, more strategic,
 functions. Although various middle managers may be able to take
 more responsbility for decisions through the availability of more
 information they do so within pre-determined premises, that is within
 limits that have been set by higher management.
  Thus, computerisation radically affected many jobs in the office
 and altered its structure and dynamics. Unlike earlier forms of
 mechanisation, computerisation had a profound effect on the
 organisational structure. It also required a reappraisal of both data
 and information flow. The application of mathematical techniques in
 conjunction with electronic data processing and operational research
 rationalised decision-making. This directly affected planning proce-
 dures and management and often led to recentralisation as many
 previously separate departments (such as sales and marketing) were
 reintegrated into a centralised office structure.
   In the office, those adversely affected by computerisation were
 principally the female clerical workers who, with the use of EDP,
 became key-punch operators. Key-punching became the largest
 single category of computer-related work, contradicting claims that
 computerisation would immediately mean a reduction in the number
 of lower skill jobs (Shepard, 1971). Hoos (1961) studied the impact of

```

-----

```
    computerisation upon female clerks in the USA and found that
    former filing and ledger clerks, of whom the vast majority were
    women, were subsequently employed as key-punch operators.
    According to Hoos, this work was monotonous and routine, it paid
     less than clerical work, and there was little chance of promotion. The
    other jobs created by computerisation — programming and systems
    analysis — required special training which the majority of women
     clerical workers would be unable to acquire. Lack of educational
    qualifications and the responsibility of married women for household
    tasks and child-care both contributed to the difficulties for women
    attempting to take advantage of such positions. Further, key-punch
    work was more easily controlled and measured by office managers
    than other clerical work. So in conclusion, Hoos argued that there
    was little evidence to support the claim that what she called
    ‘automation’ provided work of greater interest for the clerical
    workers. Thus it was the bottom group of the office hierarchy which
    benefited least from the reclassification of office jobs and which
    today continues to fill those jobs with the lowest status and lowest
    pay. That bottom group remains almost exclusively female.
     There seems little doubt then that some principles of Fordism were
    applicable to computer-dependent clerical processes, contrary to
    those who associated computerisation with decentralisation and
    upgrading. But these early applications of computerised data
    processing were limited by two factors. The first was that only highly
    structured operations, such as accounts, wages or administrative
    functions which could be represented in terms of numerical data,
    could be easily computerised. The second was the high cost of using
    mainframe computers, which necessitated the processing of high
    volumes of data in centralised computer departments.
     On the other hand the application of Fordist principles to the
    highly varied work of most offices was not an easy one. In such
     offices, both in services and manufacturing, which exist outside the
    large-scale clerical industries, the scope for routinisation and
    standardisation of procedures has been limited. This is partly due to
    the smaller scale of office work, which has limited the sub-division of
     clerical activities such as in typing pools or filing departments. Also,
     since much of the work is based around particular customer
    requirements (as in the case of service offices) or a physical
    production process (in the case of manufacturing) the scope for
    Fordist rationalisation is more limited than in some of the ‘clerical
     factories’. Although office procedures do exist for activities such as

```

```
 ordering and invoicing, stock control and cost-accounting, a signifi-
 cant proportion of routinised office work is concerned with attempt-
 ing to fit the information to be processed into the procedures, and
 with subsequent ‘trouble-shooting’ activities. Thus, although man-
 agement, operations and customer requirements, in contrast to the
 ‘classical’ organisational structure, may be in Strassman’s (1982) term
 ‘diverse’, the procedures to be followed will be standardised. This is
 particularly the case in retail offices such as estate agents, travel
 agents, professionals’ offices, which have shop-fronts, where the
 requirements of individual customers or clients have to be dealt with.
 Where service industries are more highly concentrated, these smaller
 offices are often satellites of the larger clerical headquarters. As such
 they can be seen as buffers between customers or clients and the
 larger organisations — as in the case of the local office of a bank or
 building society, for example.
 Neo-Fordism in Offices
 So if Fordism, dependent for its success as a form of production on
 standardisation, has had only a limited application within office
 work, what difference is made by the arrival of new computerised
 technologies of a much less centralised and fixed type than the
 mainframe computers of the 1960s? Despite the familiar claims that
 electronic word-processors (the most common piece of computerised
 new technology to be used in offices) would upgrade office workers
 by eliminating tedious routine tasks like the repeated retyping of
 corrected documents, it has been argued by some authors that such
 equipment has intensified prevailing [trends, ] [making ] [Fordist ] [forms ] [of ]
 work organisation easier to install [and ] [increasing ] [the ] [division ] [of ]
 labour and speed of work.°®
  A word-processing system can be described as a combination of
 equipment and personnel, working in an environment of job
 specialisation and supervisory controls, for the purpose of producing
 typed documents in a routinised, cost-effective manner. Given this
 classical Fordist description, it is unsurprising that little has been
 claimed, either by manufacturers or the management literature,
 regarding the enhancement of typists’ work with the use of
 word-processors; this is in contrast to the favourable predictions
 concerning the effect that word-processors would have upon secreta-
 rial work. What is usually claimed by manufacturers of word-

```

-----

```
    processing systems is that they make a typist’s work easier. However,
     this must be offset by the effects [of ] [standardisation, ] [fragmentation, ]
    increased work load and supervision.
     When word-processors are introduced into a typing pool the
    overall effect is to rationalise [clerical ] [production ] [further ] [and ] [to ]
    intensify work. This process begins with an initial work study and
    continues with the automatic monitoring and increased supervision of
    work. As Softley (1984) describes:
     Before a company decides to purchase a word-processing system it
      will usually undertake some form of work study, entailing detailed
     accounting of the work being carried out in the typing pool, e.g.
      the number and type of documents typed per day and the number
     of separate revisions per document. If the decision to purchase is
     made then the results of the work study are used to standardise the
     form in which the work reaches the centre.
    For instance, an insurance company had to rationalise a hundred
     different types of forms so that a few standard layouts could be placed
     in the word-processor memory. Another insurance company failed to
    do this initially but soon realised that productivity increases
    depended on standardisation and began to alter the layout of the
    forms they used. If an organisation is intending to set up communica-
     tions systems between its different branches, then a standard format
     in all offices would be even more necessary. Another consequence of
    standards however, is the control they give to supervisors and
    management over production- and work-scheduling. Standardisation
    of work also facilitates greater fragmentation of tasks. In shared-logic
     or distributed systems, where each terminal is linked to a central
    processing unit, work can be automatically transferred from one
     typist’s terminal to another. A group of typists can then handle one
    long report simultaneously, thus increasing the division of labour in
     the pool. No longer do individual typists work through a piece of
    work but, depending on demand, they are required to work on parts
    of other documents without necessarily seeing the beginning or end
    of it, or knowing anything about what it is they are typing.
      Nevertheless, standardisation of work does not necessarily mean a
    decrease in the variety of the work performed. The majority of
    word-processor operators in Softley’s survey indicated that word-
    processing had increased the variety of their work. It could be argued
     that the incorporation of word-processing into typing systems is a

```

-----

```
 relatively recent phenomenon so that any changes now being
 observed may be purely transitory in nature. Yet, this increase in
 variety has also been reported in the USA where the average length
 of time a company had used word-processing was five years
 compared with two in Britain. The observed increased variety of
 work can be best explained by reference to the way work is organised
 in a traditional typing pool where tasks are already standardised and
 fragmented. An increase in variety in the move from typing pool to
 word-processing centre may simply indicate that different types of
 work are now being carried out, although the rules and procedures
 for completing each category of work remain standardised.
  Even though electronic word-processors seem to have exacerbated
 the Fordist aspects of typing pool work, it must be recalled that not
 all clerical workers are engaged in full-time typing so alternative
 forms of work organisation have to be envisaged. In the early 1970s
 when word-processing was first being introduced into the USA ona
 large scale the division of secretarial work into its typing and
 non-typing components, followed by centralisation of the typing/
 word-processing function, was indeed seen as the most cost-effective
 way to increase productivity. Discussion in management journals
 focused on the efficiency of word-processing centres that could
 handle the typing needs of the whole organisation. The typists, or
 word-processor operators, in these centres became known as
 ‘correspondence’ secretaries. The remaining secretarial support was
 provided by groups of ‘administrative’ secretaries, who carried out
 filing, telephoning and reception work.’ Thus, the centralisation
 extended to the secretarial function. Sometimes secretaries would
 have typewriters for short memos, otherwise all material for typing
 would be sent to the word-processing centre.
  In terms of the typing function, such centralisation represents a
 highly rationalised arrangement — the word-processing centre usually
 being administered by the office services department. In many
 companies, however, there has been considerable resistance to the
 idea of centralised control over word-processing departments.
 Individual departments and divisions often want to retain control
 over various aspects of the word-processing centre’s work — in
 particular supervision and prioritisation of work — leaving the office
 services department responsible for system and job design, installa-
 tion of the equipment and training. In the USA, there has been a
 move away from full-scale centralisation. Softley (1984) reports a
 company which, in the initial enthusiasm surrounding the introduc-

```

-----

```
    tion of word-processing ten years ago, set up a word-processing
    centre. It was soon discovered, however, that one centre did not
    provide enough flexibility. Problems arose with the scheduling of
    material and the long turnaround times, even for such things as notes
    and memos. A few years later, the secretaries, who had been grouped
    into administrative centres, were given back their typewriters and the
    correspondence centre was split into three smaller ones. The
    word-processing centre had been decentralised.
     In Britain, the introduction of word-processing has not so far
    meant much large-scale organisational change. For the most part,
    companies have simply switched from centralised typing to central-
    ised word-processing (Manpower Services Commission, 1982; Stef-
    fens, 1983). At the time of writing, word-processing is just beginning
    to have some impact on the work of British secretaries. In small to
    medium-sized companies the quantity of repetitive typing work
    carried out by personal secretaries does not usually justify the
    purchase of a word-processor and in other organisations secretaries
    have access to a word-processor but are not usually employed as
    full-time operators.
      It must be remembered that electronic word-processors are only
    one component of computerised office equipment that is likely to be
    introduced into offices over the next decade. The other equipment —
    particularly desktop computers and intelligent telecommunications
   devices — will be significant in boosting the productivity of office
    workers who are not typists. As Strassman (1982), a senior executive
    with Xerox, the office equipment company, put it, ‘(Such equipment)
    can compress the time for completing work ... by altogether
    eliminating many labour-intensive office tasks performed by craft
    specialists whose burdensome and sometimes frustrating jobs are
    now embedded into the electronic workstation by means of software’.
     Just as with manufacturing industry, some writers have suggested
    that non-Fordist types of work organisation are more appropriate for
    the operation of these high variety computerised technologies if
   maximum efficiency is to be obtained from them. However, there
    have been fewer studies of such alternative forms of job design for
    office work than for manufacturing work. Mumford is one of the
    most prolific writers on this subject. She has carried out several
    studies of the introduction and design of computer systems (Mumford
    and Henshall, 1983; Mumford, 1983; Mumford, Land and Hawgood,
    1978). Like socio-technical systems theorists (see Chapter 5) Mum-
    ford argues that the structure of workgroups need not be determined

```

-----

```
 solely by the technological system, but that a fair degree of
 ‘organisational choice’ is possible, allowing the formation of non-
 specialised, but integrated, workgroups. Designing work systems in
  this way is supposed to increase job satisfaction for the workers
 concerned, and the involvement of workers in the actual design of
 work systems is a key feature of Mumford’s approach. Most recently
 Mumford has been involved in the design of word-processing work
 systems in private companies, where unionisation among typists and
 secretaries is low.
  Mumford uses the concept of a ‘design group’ in her work,
 meaning a participative approach to changing work methods which
 aims to balance the efficiency needs of the organisation against
 worker satisfaction. Systems should be designed which are not simply
 concerned with the choice of computer hardware but also with the
 overall organisational system, ‘which includes a network of people
 carrying out a variety of roles and having individual and job
  satisfaction needs’ (Mumford et al., 1978, p. 2). The design process is
 therefore much more extensive than was envisaged when early
 training programmes for systems analysts were conceived: ‘It requires
 of the system analyst an ability to identify and specify both
 organisational and social needs and to create a socio-technical system
  that facilitates the achievement of these needs’ (ibid). The design
 process uses several of the standard analytical/design tools that have
 been traditionally used by socio-technical analysts, but by arguing for
  a group participative approach to the design, evaluation and
 implementation of new systems, Mumford departs from the standard
 way of designing work systems.
  The design process has been applied by Mumford in the redesign of
  a system at ICI’s central management division. A video, Reliving the
 Journey, has been made of the process. Between them the ICI
 secretaries work for over fifty managers. With such a heavy
 workload, the word-processors that had been installed were in
 constant demand and problems arose [with ] [the ] [scheduling ] [of ] [work. ]
 The video describes how the secretaries [analysed ] [their ] [workloads ] [and ]
 decided on the most appropriate work-scheduling [process ] [(Mumford, ]
 1983).
   In another project, involving clerical workers at Rolls Royce’s
 Derby plant, Mumford set up a programme of workers’ involvement
  in the design of a new on-line computer system. A design group was
  set up composed of workers from the departments involved in the
 reorganisation, together with a steering group made up of middle and

```

-----

```
    upper level management and a trade union official. After studying
    various alternatives, the design group drew up three system designs
    which were submitted for comments to both clerks and management.
    One version was then chosen and implemented. Kraft (1979) has
    criticised this approach because the clerks were not given the choice
    as to whether they wanted a change or not, the members of the design
    group were selected by management rather than being elected by
    their fellow clerks, no mention was made of issues such as job
    security and work loads and the trades union was relegated to only a
    minor role. In the event, management agreed to implement an
    alternative favoured by the clerks, but only as a short-term measure,
    for they intended to introduce their favoured system ‘when the clerks
    had got used to the autonomous group concept’ (Mumford and
    Henshall, 1983, p. 75).
     Kraft’s criticisms show that the libertarian, work-humanising
    ideologies of job redesigners like Mumford are severely constrained
    by the realities of management power and prerogative, but this is
    partly beside the point. What is important to managements eager to
    get the maximum productivity benefits out of new technology is that
    their workers should be sufficiently flexible in their approach to
    work-load scheduling. The reorganisation of work around ‘auton-
   omous work groups’ is simply one means to this end. Of course, some
    employees and their representative trade unions may have objections
    to such new forms of work organisation, particularly if they imply a
    reduction in employment or some uncompensated increase in overall
    work-load or some alteration of demarcation lines. This is why job
    redesign, in office work as well as in manufacturing, is easier to carry
    out where trade unions are non-existent or weak or under strong
    pressure because of some unfavourable competitive situation in their
    firm.
     From the viewpoint of managements, the successful economic
    introduction of information technologies requires some new forms of
    work organisation — one of the elements of neo-Fordism — and it is
    the opposition of workforces committed to the institutionalised
    divisions associated with existing ‘craft’ or Fordist labour processes
    that managements must seek to overcome. The job redesign
    procedures advocated by Mumford for office work based on
    computerised technologies are a means of seeking to engage the
   commitment of workers to more flexible working arrangements
    which must go with technologies that raise the productivity of high
    variety labour processes. Autonomous work-groups, implying the

```

-----

```
 participation of workers in the design of their jobs and in the
 allocation of work tasks require a more wholehearted commitment to
 the overall production process than might be expected by the
 application of more coercive Fordist principles of labour division and
 task allocation associated with standardised work routines. Such a
 view is implicit in the idea that ‘future administrative systems’ using
 information technologies will possess:
  greater diversity in procedures that can readily be customised to
  respond to the need of diverse customers. This diversity in
  procedure is built up by combining standard modules of know-
  how, usually incorporated into software, together with an in-
  creased amount of choice made possible through individual
  initiative and through work group co-operation. (Strassman, 1982)
  The use of autonomous work-groups is however not the only form
 of non-Fordist organisation that can be envisaged using information
 technologies to handle information. If close contact between mem-
 bers of the group is essential to the work they perform then group
 working will be particularly appropriate. But advanced telecom-
 munications technologies make it possible for much clerical work to
 be done in a geographically dispersed manner with centralised
 monitoring and co-ordination of the ‘remote workers’ who will be
 ‘teleworkers’ working at computer terminals in their own homes.
  Huws (1984) reports a number of examples of teleworking in
 Britain and the USA. Whereas most teleworkers at the moment tend
 to be higher professionals, often working freelance within the
 computer industry itself, there [is ][a ] [growing, ] [if ][still ] [small, ] [number ] [of ]
 non-professionals. Some are involved in ‘offshore information
 processing’. American Airlines, [for ] [example, ] [closed ] [down ] [its ] [data ]
 entry operations in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1983 and hired 200
 Barbadians to do the work, [using ] [a ] [satellite ] [link ] [between ] [the ]
 Barbados workers and the Tulsa [data-processing ] [centre. ] [(In ][the ] [age ]
 of modern telecommunications, [everywhere ] [it ] [seems ] [is ] [less ] [than ]
 twenty-four hours from Tulsa! (Pitney, 1963)).
  Given the prevailing sexual division of domestic labour, most of
 the teleworkers Huws surveyed were women, almost all with
 child-care responsibilities. Telework then, although convenient for
 otherwise housebound women who wish to work for wages, has many
 of the disadvantages of domestic outwork — isolation, unsocial
 working hours, inadequate technical support, no fringe benefits.

```

-----

```
    Such arrangements are however highly advantageous to the subcon-
    tracting firms. Huws reports:
     (One firm) estimates that homeworkers produce about 30 per cent
     more than office-based workers in the same time, while ICL claims
      that twenty-five hours work in the home is equivalent to forty in
      the office . . . Another important advantage of employing home-
     workers was the reduction in overhead costs. These did not just
     consist of floorspace, heating and lighting, but also included
     administrative support services and, where homeworkers were
     self-employed, perks such as company cars, subsidised meals,
    BUPA and pension schemes as well as holiday, sickness and
     maternity pay. Flexibility of working hours was also cited as a
     positive feature of employing homeworkers. This was particularly
     important in the jobs which made major demands on central
     data-processing facilities, since work could be timetabled to fit in
     with times when there was spare capacity on the computers, and
     off-peak telecommunication charges applied. (Huws, 1984, p. 16)
     But there are also a number of disadvantages — monitoring and
    supervision of non-routine homework is more difficult than when
    workers are on the organisation’s premises. Obviously, telework’s
    future is dependent on whether techniques of remote monitoring can
    be devised, as well as on the complex calculus, by firms and by
    potential teleworkers, of factors such as the relative costs of
    telecommunications, office rents, transport to work and wages.
    Conclusion
    To summarise this section, whereas it has been possible to transform
    the production of some clerical work services along Fordist lines, this
    has generally been limited by the degree of variety of the clerical
    work concerned. The success of such transformation and reorganisa-
    tion has been strongest in those services which could be described as
     clerical industries. These include services like banking, insurance and
    finance, mail order and public administration. In general, other
    clerical work has proved much more difficult to reorganise along
    Fordist lines, and as yet, the computerised office technologies in use
     in offices have tended to be restricted to one part of the clerical
    process — typing. The integration of separate pieces of office equip-

 ment, within and between offices, and their diffusion into many more
 service sectors—in short the increased use of flexible office
 equipment — will permit all sorts of ‘information workers’ to perform
 a wider array of non-standardised tasks at higher productivity levels.
 This suggests that the limitations of Fordist applications might be
 transcended. This will be especially the case if new concepts of job
 design are widely,adopted or if telework becomes more acceptable.
 Together one might characterise these changes as neo-Fordism in
 clerical work.
 THE RESTRUCTURING OF SERVICE PRODUCTS
 However, the application of such neo-Fordist principles to the
 organisation of clerical processes in the production of the services is
 not the sole way in which the limitations of Fordism can be overcome;
 indeed, although it is certainly important in the short term, we are of
 the view that there are much more substantial changes in service
 provision that can be envisaged. In other words, the services could
 also be transformed by changing the way in which they are delivered,
 that is by changing the form of the service product itself. This can be
 done in two ways: by externalising part of the service labour, shifting
 it on to the consumers themselves; and, more dynamically, by
 changes in the kinds of services which are offered to satisfy human
 needs. We elaborate on each of these in turn.
 Externalisation of Service Labour
 One way round the problems of significantly raising labour produc-
 tivity in services is by the externalisation of the labour of providing the
 service. Thus, rather than provide the service ‘in full’, service
 production takes the form of providing the users with the means to
 provide the service, to varying degrees, for themselves. The user
 contributes some of the labour, unpaid, whilst capital provides the
 means of production! The externalisation of labour can take various
 forms. One form is that of reorganisation of service industries so as to
 incorporate a self-service element, familiar examples of this being in
 restaurants and supermarkets. Here, it is the equivalent of the
 assembly operations of Fordism which are externalised. Going
 around a supermarket, shoppers assemble their particular basket of

```

-----

```
    goods from the module of components which are presented to them
    by waged service workers (shelf-fillers, stock controllers, etc.).
    Similarly, in a self-service restaurant a meal is ‘assembled’ from a
    choice of components. Other consumer services such as banks and
    libraries are adopting this technique, organising the self-service
    activity around information technology (such as cash points).
     The transformation of the labour process in the delivery of services
     is probably most developed in the case of supermarket retailing. This
    process began in inter-war America where use of self-service spread
    horizontally to practically all types of retail stores; only later did these
    techniques diffuse through British retailing (Dawson, 1981, p. 22).
    The development of supermarkets in the USA during the 1930s
    depended not only on the provision of private transport and a
    developed road infrastructure to enable the volume of sales to be
    increased, but also on the availability of standardised products. The
    prepackaging of food by canning and wrapping, along with the use of
    refrigeration and preservatives to ensure shelf life and also the
    grading of perishables, allowed a wide variety of goods to be
    available from different suppliers. Yet externalisation of labour
    allows the sloughing off of more labour-intensive bespoke work, the
    assembly of different individual baskets of goods, on to the
    consumer. In retailing then, the servicing tasks of selling, weighing
    out, bagging and standardisation of products, are displaced from the
    retailer to the supplier, whilst the selection, retrieval of goods and
    delivery are shifted onto the buyer with self-service and cash and
    carry; so the economies of scale of supermarket retailing only capture
    part of the rising productivity of retailing, the other parts being
    accounted for by self-service, together with food-processing and
    packaging developments.
     A similar case is that of catering, where the assembly line of the
    cafeteria resembles that of Fordist production processes. There are
    analogous problems of sequentiality and line-balancing just like the
    assembly lines in production, since the speed of the line is dictated by
    the slowest customer and bottlenecks often occur. Currently several
    of these cafeteria systems are being changed from one single line to
    several mini-lines for different parts of the meal (meat dishes, fish
     dishes, sweets, drinks, etc.) in an attempt to overcome such
    problems. Such reorganisation of flow-lines is similar to parallel flow
    reorganisation in production assembly, detailed in Chapter 6. Note
    that supermarkets do not face this problem since customers are not
    bound to follow a prearranged route through the supermarket; they

```

-----

```
  can vary their route according to the desired constituents of their
  shopping baskets. In this sense the supermarket and reorganised
  cafeteria have more in common with neo-Fordist forms of organisa-
  tion than Fordist ones. The exception to this is, of course, the
  check-out queue. It is to this bottleneck that computerised technolo-
  gies such as electronic point-of-sales systems are being directed.”
   The introduction of computerised information-handling systems
  makes externalisation possible in some other service industries. Most
  notably, the rapid diffusion of automatic tellers/cashpoints inside and
  outside banks can be seen as a way of increasing the productivity of
  bank workers by mechanising simple monetary transactions. One can
  envisage similar developments in such labour-intensive services as
  ticket sales, food and drink vending and non-complex information
  and advice dissemination.
  The Restructuring of Consumption
  An an alternative to externalisation, the means of production of
  services can be sold direct to the user in the form of a physical
  commodity. This has already been an aspect of the Fordist
  restructuring of consumption. Rather than producing the means of
  production for the collective provision of services, some industries
  have concentrated on the provision of consumer goods for individual
  or household consumption. To explore this further we will briefly
  recapitulate and extend some of the ideas of Aglietta presented
  earlier in Chapter 3.
   Aglietta characterises the historical development of capitalism in
  the USA as a regime of extensive accumulation in the nineteenth
  century followed by a regime of intensive accumulation, which was
  constituted politically in the 1930s and 1940s in the New Deal and in
  World War Two and generalised world-wide after the war. But
  Aglietta’s major contribution is his description of this shift as a
  ‘simultaneous revolution of both the labour process and the
  conditions of existence of the wage-earning class’ (Aglietta, 1979,
  p. 20), together constituting a Fordist regime of intensive accumula-
   tion. Aglietta therefore sees Fordism not only as a set of principles
  for organising a production process in a particular way but also as
  involving the fact that consumption of those products has to be
  ‘organised’ to guarantee profitable sales of the mass-produced items.”
   This change in the ‘conditions of existence of the working class’

```

-----

```
    came about through the development of a homogenised mode of
    consumption based on the commodities from old and new branches
    of production organised along mass-production lines. The change
    took place in two phases. First, the depression of the 1930s is
    explained as a crisis in the extension of the norms of consumption
    from the rising ‘middle class’, who were the main markets for the
    growing new consumer industries of the early twentieth century, to
    the working class who so far had not significantly participated in
    purchasing these new products. The New Deal in the USA and the
    adoption of Keynesian welfare state policies in Europe after World
    War Two restructured capitalist economies from their pre-war
    depression to lay the basis for a post-war phase of energetic intensive
    accumulation. Second, the most recent sustained period of accumula-
    tion from the 1940s onwards involved the diffusion of Fordism
    throughout the mass-production sectors of capitalist economies. The
    potential profitability of this form of the labour process crucially
    depended on the active construction of economies of scale, and
    therefore on the restructing of consumption.
     While we do not feel that Aglietta’s account of how labour process
    change was linked to phases of economic growth is adequate by
    itself — indeed the first three chapters of this book constitute an
    account with a different emphasis— we do agree with him that
    Fordism implies an analysis of consumption as well as production. He
    sees the consumption changes as the following:
     @ the commoditisation of the means of consumption: the transforma-
      tion of domestic household labour activities in such a way as to
     open up markets for profitable production of consumer goods
     aimed at the individual household. Examples would be factory-
     produced clothing instead of home-made; bought and semi-
     processed foods instead of domestically grown and prepared; the
      use of domestic appliances and automobiles, etc.
     © homogenisation of this consumption by means of standardised
     mass-produced commodities. The economies which this form of
     production allows undermine the necessity for and economic
      viability of domestically-produced alternatives.
     @ an extension of these consumption norms to more and more
      sections of the working class in advanced countries, not least to
     non-working dependents (the old, the sick).
     The developments in the 1930s and 1940s which Aglietta sees as
    facilitating these trends are:

```

-----

```
  @ an infrastructure of housing, roads and utilities within which a
   large consumer-durable market could arise.
  @ collective bargaining, which permitted planned increases in wages
   and the reduction of working time, especially for white, male,
   organised workers and established income security for less-well-
   organised sections of workers.
  @ welfare systems which introduced a minimum social wage and
   assisted in the generalisation of the social consumption norm.
  © financial innovations— credit, hire purchase —to facilitate
   purchases.
   Thus, by the 1950s and early 1960s it had been possible to generalise
  Fordist labour processes, extending them to industries producing
  what were ‘luxury’ goods before the war. Both old products and new
  products fitted into the Fordist production norm which was aided by
  short-life, cheap goods (planned obsolescence) and the homogenisa-
  tion of oligopolised markets by advertising.
   Despite its prolonged success there are progressive limits to the
  continued efficiency of Fordism. Aglietta, like us, sees these limits as
  part of the present economic crisis. These exist both in established
  Fordist production processes, which we have already mentioned in
  Chapter 3, and in the extension of Fordism to other sectors. 1°
   The importance of this analysis for our discussion of the service
  sector is its emphasis on how the nature and form of some service
  provision has already been radically changed by Fordism. This raises
  the question of how further changes in service provision might be
  brought about, either by development of Fordism or by neo-Fordism.
   Aglietta draws attention to the limited applicability of Fordism to
  reducing the cost of the collective welfare services of health care,
  education and public administration. Echoing some British monetar-
  ist writers, Aglietta suggests that the low growth in productivity, but
  rise in real wages, in these labour-intensive service sectors has acted
  as a brake on accumulation. This can only be resolved by ‘radically
  transforming the conditions of production of the means of collective
  consumption [the welfare services]’, renewed accumulation only
  beginning with ‘a massive transformation of unproductive labour into
  labour productive of surplus value’ (Aglietta, 1979, p. 157).
   A similar analysis of services, though not situated within the
  development of the organisation of production or within broader
  politico-economic factors relating to the progress of capital accumula-

     tion, has been put forward by Gershuny and Miles (1983). They
    argue that over the past fifty years major service functions have been
    affected by a change in the pattern of service consumption. The
    transport service function, for example, was satisfied in the 1930s by a
    transport service industry of railways, buses and trams, privately- and
    publicly-provided, which offered many people occupations in the
    transport service. Technologically, the industry combined these
    occupations with heavy machinery (the trains, the buses) within an
    established physical infrastructure of the railway and road systems.
    These combinations of technology, infrastructure and specific social
    arrangements Gershuny and Miles call ‘socio-technical systems’ (not
     to be confused with the identical term for a type of work
    organisation, as discussed in Chapter 5).
      In the 1980s, however, there is a strikingly different socio-technical
    system of transport service function provision. Whereas collectively-
    used transport service industries are still in business (and now
    embrace air travel as well) there has been a shift to the satisfaction of
     this function by ‘self-service’ modes. Encouraged by the cheapness of
    mass-produced commodities, individuals now purchase hardware
    from the manufacturing sector (namely cars in this example) and
    drive them themselves, in effect using their own unpaid labour. The
    balance between the formal service industry provision of transport
    and its ‘informal’ self-service provision has shifted. The service
    function has become ‘privatised’ in the sense that every household is
    encouraged to purchase its own car. What follows is falling
    employment in the public transport service industry and, until
    recently, rising employment in the manufacture of transport pro-
    ducts. Gershuny and Miles argue that similar shifts have occurred
     in the satisfaction of other service functions — particularly in
    the domestic, entertainment and communications service func-
    tions, which are now reorganised around manufactured com-
    modities.
      In entertainment, direct entertainment (theatre, cinema) has been
    replaced by broadcasting and receiving equipment and video- and
    audio-recording and playback equipment with associated software —
    TV programmes, records, video tapes. In the domestic services, the
    balance has shifted, notably with the provision of domestic appliances
    but also with ‘do-it-yourself’ equipment for other domestic services
    such as building maintenance, decorating and appliance and car
    repairs. In short, the parallel development of production and
    consumption based on Fordist industries has acted to expand and

```

-----

```
  transform consumption of entertainment, transport and domestic
  services away from provision by service industries towards the
  consumption of goods.'!
   The transformations in these service sectors has been termed by
  Gershuny and Miles ‘social innovation’, based on the growth of what
  they call self-servicing (to be distinguished from the form of
  self-servicing described earlier as ‘externalisation’). The penetration
  of service sectors and their transformation by, originally American,
  large capital has been indirect through the marketing of mass-
  consumption products rather than transformation of the existing
  service industries themselves.
   A necessary condition of this development, as we have already
  pointed out, was the provision and extension of particular infrastruc-
  tures on which the mass-produced commodities of cars, domestic
  appliances and electronic consumer goods were dependent; public
  roads and later motorways, the national utility networks, the
  broadcasting network. Of course, this domestic consumption was also
  linked to the increasing provision of adequate public and private
  housing over the post-war period.
   Despite the relative decline of service industries providing equiva-
  lent functions to those of the new mass-produced commodities
  (public transport, domestic services, cinemas and theatres) a new
  type of service grew — which Gershuny and Miles have labelled
  ‘intermediate consumer services’. Unlike the provision of service
  functions taking the form of final consumer services, intermediate
  consumer services involve servicing [the ] [new ] [forms ] [of ] [consumption: ]
  for example, domestic appliance repair [and ] [maintenance, ] [broadcast- ]
  ing stations, garages and recording [industries. ] [In ] [the ] [case ] [of ] [record ]
  and, later, video industries, [this ] [intermediate ] [service ] [involves ] [the ]
  production and sale of goods, [such ] [as ] [records, ] [audio ] [tapes, ] [video ]
  tapes, as a physical vehicle [for ] [the ] [‘software’ ] [service, ] [as ] [distinct ] [from ]
  broadcasting which provides [the ] [software ] [instantaneously ] [rather ] [than ]
  in the form of a material commodity.
   One crucial difference between the purchase of services and the
  consumption of service-replacing consumer goods lies in the pro-
  vision of labour needed to produce the final service. In the case of
  ‘social innovation’ the labour is ultimately supplied by the consumer.
  The ‘labour-saving’ effect of domestic appliances on domestic labour
  is a form of labour externalisation in service functions. '* Rather than
  enter and transform the low-productivity traditional service sector of,
  for example, laundries, domestic decorating or repairs, passenger

```

```
    transport or live entertainment, capital investment took place instead
    in mass-production of consumer goods.
     So the transformation of service functions by the use of Fordist
    products is complex. It fulfils certain needs (mobility, washing
    clothes, leisure, etc.) by means of a changed product but it also assists
    certain types of firms differentially because of the relative ease of
    increasing productivity and profits in, say, automobile engineering as
    compared to transport services. Also, the total level of demand for
    service functions is expanded by channelling consumers’ needs into
    the profitable consumption of Fordist commodities, rather than the
    use of collective services. The problem of increasing the productivity
    of labour in service industries is, in effect, circumvented by
    externalising the necessary labour from the formal (paid) to the
    informal (unpaid) sector. The question now is: do information
    technologies make such developments more ‘attractive’ in other
    service sectors?
    Restructuring State Services
    The group of services least affected by the developments discussed so
     far are those provided by the state. Authors of many conflicting
    ideological persuasions agree that any long-term economic upswing
     in advanced capitalist economies — at any rate an upswing which
    maintains the essential features of the capitalist mode of production —
     is threatened by the large proportion of the national product which is
    spent on state-provided services.'*’ These services may be thought of
     as welfare provisions, but they are also essential for profitable
    industry insofar as they generalise the costs of the ‘reproduction’ of
    the workforce. They provide education, training and health care for
    the workforce of today and tomorrow, and services like rubbish
    collection, sewage treatment, roads and energy supplies, which
    maintain general social health and offer cheap means of production
    and distribution for the output of private industry. As a result of the
    enormous social, health and environmental problems which the rapid
    industrial growth of the past thirty years has produced, other services
    have grown to deal with the diseconomies of capitalist production.
    Hence there has been the growth of regulatory services to deal with
    pollution and environmental problems, of planning services to
    attempt to bring some order to the otherwise anarchic locational
    decisions of modern corporations and of social work services to police

  and provide sustenance to those who do not quite fit the personality
 requirements of the modern good citizen. Added to this, for some
  countries, is the enormous cost of providing military arsenals to
  protect the perceived interests of the advanced capitalist states.
   The emergence of the welfare state in Britain after the ‘post-war
  settlement’ involved an acknowledgement by the ruling class, via the
  state, of the inability of market mechanisms to fulfil certain social
  needs — particularly those associated with the reproduction of the
  labour force and the maintenance of the non-working population. It
  was a result both of class struggles for improved housing, health and
  education and of a perceived need for more instruments of social
  control (Gough, 1979, p. 52). The post-war Welfare State took on
  responsibilities for the provision of collective social services, which
  have in turn undergone a fairly continuous growth during the
  post-war boom. The growth of collective provision in education and
  in medicine contrasts with the reduced provision of those collective
  services providing parallel facilities in transport, entertainment and
  domestic services which, as we have [already ] [argued, ] [were ] [the ] [main ]
  targets of the Fordist production of consumer goods.
   In fact, the collective services of education, welfare and medicine
  are less amenable to commodity substitution than those of transport,
  entertainment and domestic work. They involve large elements of
  professional work which has acted as a brake on social innovation in
  the provision of such services. There are some examples of
  commoditised, self-service varieties, such as home instruction
  courses, community care schemes and patent medicines but these
  form the minority of service provision. A second function of such
  services provided by the state is that of ensuring social control and the
  adequate reproduction of the workforce. In the case of welfare
  services especially, but also in large parts of education and medicine,
  state responsibility reflects a broad concern with ensuring particular
  standards of child-care, socialisation and health. This often involves
  the support and policing of family units, these being the preferred site
  of social reproduction. Institutions of education and medicine have
  been developed so as to augment rather than replace the family as a
  fundamental site of reproduction. So total service provision (for
  example, children’s homes or long-stay hospital wards) are seen as
  necessary only when family-based provision is declared inadequate
  by state functionaries. Hence the scope for self-service, commodi-
  tised replacement of state services has been limited by the need for
  the state to exercise social control functions via professional agencies.

     As the economic situation has deteriorated, increasing pressure has
    been felt to restructure this pattern of state services in all advanced
    capitalist countries, though to different degrees. This has come from
    various sources, which include:
     @ political parties and parts of the state itself. Monetarist strategies
      to reduce the overall level of state expenditure have resulted in
      cuts in state services and attempts to increase the efficiency of
      welfare services like medicine, social services, education, cleaning,
      refuse collection and public transport.
     @ private service companies, especially in the areas of cleaning,
      catering, security, refuse disposal, etc. who see their market
     shrinking because of the downturn in economic activity in the
      private sector. They see the public sector as a potential area of
      growth.
     ® capital goods manufacturers, who see the mechanisation of parts
      of the service sectors as possible markets for their new computer-
     based and high technology machinery.
     @ the users of services who see the often unresponsive and
      ineffective services provided by the state worsen as cutbacks and
     spending limitations reduce the adequacy and level of provision of
      collective services.
     The outcome of the conflicts between these competing forces is
    obviously unclear. One thing is clear: the level of state expenditure
    on the services provided by the state is unlikely to maintain the rate
    of increase of the past decade over the next one. What sort of changes
    might be expected in the functions at present provided by the state?
     An important dramatic change in recent years, particularly in
     Britain, has been the significant entry of private capital into the area
     of the economy previously accounted for by the state provision of
    collective direct services. For example, the private health care
    business in Britain accounted for £330m in 1981. Large service
    companies operate at an international level in the fields of cleaning
    and catering: for example, operating huge service-contracts in the
    Middle East and Mexico supplying street-cleaning, refuse or large-
     scale catering. Furthermore it has been government policy in Britain
    deliberately to force the introduction of private firms into state
    services in an attempt to reduce expenditure on them. Thus recent
    government directives have been issued to force health authorities in
     the National Health Service to award contracts for ancillary services
    such as cleaning, laundry and catering. At present private firms are

```

-----

```
  competing against the public provision of these services at the
  expense of the wages and conditions of their workers and the quality
  of services provided. This has been found to be the case especially in
  cleaning. Commercial catering is becoming more capital-intensive
  with the introduction of ‘cook and chill’ and ‘cook and freeze’ systems
  of meal-preparation. This form of catering has applications in industrial
  and public catering and is also being considered as a replacement for
  school meals, as well as replacing meals on wheels (provision of meals
  i a state-funded voluntary service for the elderly and housebound).
   The entry of capital into new sectors and the subsequent increase in
  capital-intensity is a well-established process within manufacturing
  but collective services are now experiencing changes along these lines
  too. The use of television monitors and electronic surveillance
  techniques in security work and the use of computers to optimise the
  movements of vehicles in refuse collection or public transport are
  further examples. It is not necessary for privatisation of services to
  take place before such transformations can occur. Capital-goods
  suppliers often have an important role in diffusing new techniques and
  technologies. (For example, British Oxygen Company, suppliers of
  liquid nitrogen, have strongly supported the development and use of
  ‘cook and freeze’ technology.) And these state services tend to have
  certain features which are ideal for technical and organisational
  changes, such as guaranteed, large and continuous markets for their
  services, attributes particularly appealing to private contractors,
  whose access to finance is greater.
  RESTRUCTURING HEALTH CARE SERVICES
  Introduction
  We do not intend to explore all the possible scenarios for the
  transformation of state sector services here.'* In the remainder of this
  chapter we will use one sector as a ‘case study’. The role of
  information technologies in health care will be a useful example for
  some speculative discussion of how service provision might change in
  the future.
   We should emphasise that our discussion is speculative. The
  technological developments we describe are not necessarily very well
  advanced in the sense that they are likely to diffuse rapidly

```

-----

```
    throughout the health-care sector of any advanced capitalist country.
    Such diffusion would anyway require substantial changes in the
    organisation of the institutions which currently provide health care
    (such as the National Health Service - NHS — in Britain) in the
    attitudes of the medical professions to certain medical technologies as
    well as substantial public investment in the appropriate telecom-
    munication infrastructures. These changes will not come about
    because developments in information technology ‘demand’ them;
    they clearly involve complex professional and political struggles.
    However, we seek to describe some of the strategic ‘options’ for the
    development of health-care services in advanced capitalist countries
    (although we focus principally on Britain) as seen from the
    perspective we have developed in this chapter — namely, the restruc-
    turing of services taking advantage of the economies offered by
    information technologies in the context of solving the long-term
    structural economic crisis of capitalist countries.
     Over the past ten years, governments in all advanced capitalist
    countries have sought to slow, or even reverse, the growth of welfare
    expenditure by a variety of means. They include: the closure of
    inefficient facilities (rationalisation); an increase in the efficiency of
    ancillary services (such as laundry and catering) either by better
    management methods and the use of less labour-intensive equipment
    or by subcontracting these services to more efficient outside agencies
    (called ‘privatisation’ in Britain) and reforms in the management and
    financial structure of the services so as to introduce stricter
    cost-accounting methods.
     The increasing cost of medical care has proved a problem for both
    the state-provided service and the private, profit-making sector; in
    the latter, increasing competition between private companies provid-
    ing health insurance which funds the majority of private health care
    has put pressure on private hospitals to economise. The effect of
    these competitive pressures has been varied. One major factor
    differentiating private from public provision has been the quality of
    cost-accounting information available in the former. This allows
    high-cost procedures, both medical and administrative, to be
    identified more easily for cost-saving. As a result, even private
    hospitals are beginning to realise the dominant role that senior
    hospital doctors play in determining the costs of medical treatment
    (Financial Times, survey, 24 January, 1984).
      In health care, the organisational changes that are under way also
    have a technological dimension, in both the administration and in the

```

-----

```
  delivery of care. In administration for example, computers are being
  used in resource management to facilitate better planning. They are
  also used in keeping records of patients and in scheduling appoint-
  ments. Such developments are extensions into medical administra-
  tion of computer hardware and software applications already in
  routine use in other spheres.'” But it is in the delivery of health care
  that the most interesting and socially significant technological
  innovations are taking place. .
   Much attention has been directed towards reducing costs by
  changing methods of surgery, the most profitable area of medical
  care in the private sector. This can be done either by the introduction
  of capital-intensive high technology medical equipment or by a
  expansion of day-care facilities, reducing the overheads of twenty-
  four-hour nursing care (currently around £100-£200 per night). New
  techniques which simplify surgical routines, such as the use of lasers,
  or even remove the need for surgery altogether, as in the use of the
  lithotripter to remove kidney stones, can be used to cut both surgery
  and after-care costs.'° Also the profit-making sector has a role in
  trying out new technologies and care techniques, even though the use
  of such techniques in private medicine may be for marketing reasons,
  to give a ‘high-tech’ image, rather than because it has proved
  efficacious (see Thunhurst, 1982, pp. 43-6).
   The process of transformation of the state-supported health care
  sector by private medical capital is likely to be a difficult business. As
  the critics of the growth of private [medicine ] [alongside ] [the ] [NHS ] [in ]
  Britain have noted, much of [the ] [growth ] [depends ] [on ] [the ] [satisfaction ] [of ]
  lucrative markets such as acute surgery [at ] [the ] [expense ] [of ][the ] [NHS, ] [in ]
  terms of the use of its trained [staff ] [and ] [facilities ] [(Iliffe, ] [1983). ] [At ]
  present, resistance to the development of the [private ] [medical ]
  business within the public [sector ] [has ] [led ] [to ] [the ] [growth ] [of ][the ] [private ]
  sector outside it. Hence the [massive ] [burst ] [of ][private ] [hospital ] [building ]
  in Britain over the last few [years, ] [which ] [has ] [doubled ] [the ] [number ] [of ]
  private beds. Current attempts [to ] [reduce ] [National ] [Health ] [Service ]
  costs revolve around [the ] [privatisation ] [of ] [ancillary ] [services ] [but ] [this ]
  would still leave much [of ][the ] [medical ] [core ] [intact. ] [To ] [transform ] [that ]
  would involve a major [reform ] [of ] [the ] [professional ] [powers ] [of ][doctors ]
  and, ultimately, consultants.
   One proposal which has been mooted for this purpose is the
  replacement of the current managerial committees involving adminis-
  trators, consultants and nursing officers in the NHS by professional
  managers. Such a radical proposal is sure to meet with resistance

```

-----

```
    from senior doctors as well as from those workers in the NHS who
    favour more democratic forms of organisation. However, in private
    hospitals, such a management structure is more likely to be
   implemented particularly in the profit-making hospitals. In fact,
    current state policies in Britain seem to be directed at dissolving the
    barrier between private and public provision rather than dismantling
    the public service as such. So the outcome of these developments and
    similar ones in other countries is open. In some countries we may see
    a two-tier system of health care emerging, much like that in the USA,
    with a large private sector backed up by a rundown public sector
    acting as a welfare ‘safety net’ for the poor. Alternatively, there may
    be a restructured universal service, although perhaps provided in
    large part by private medical firms under overall state regulation. A
    more preferable outcome might be a better-funded and more
    responsive public service under wider democratic control.
    Information Technologies in Health Care
    Apart from the technologies of in-hospital patient treatment, there
    are technological developments based on information technologies
    which are of interest for the longer-term restructuring of health
    services: computer-aided diagnosis, automatic analysis and remote
    monitoring of patients. We elaborate on these in turn.
    Computer-aided Diagnostic Systems
    Computer-aided systems of diagnosis are already used in a variety of
    contexts in the formal health care system.'’ Such systems can be used
    as computer-aided learning techniques for training medical person-
    nel. In health care itself they can be used to collect information from
    patients in advance of any professional diagnosis in a hospital or in a
    doctor’s surgery or to assist doctors by calculating the relative
    probability of various diseases from declared symptoms. Computer-
    aided diagnosis has been shown to work in hospital environments at
    levels of comparable accuracy to diagnosis performed by doctors.
    There are also savings to be made by reducing the number of
    operations and tests which are otherwise performed unnecessarily.
    There are economic incentives which could stimulate the wider
    introduction of computer-aided diagnosis into the formal health care

```

-----

```
 system. Diagnosis could be done more quickly, thus increasing the
 productivity of doctors or alternatively, diagnoses could be made
 more simply and could be performed by lower salaried para-medics.
  However, the speed with which such systems are introduced will
 depend on institutional factors, such as the attitude of the medical
 professionals and on the technical constraints of the kinds of
 computer programs that are developed. There are two general
 methods of computerised diagnosis. One — the ‘statistical’ method —
 needs a certain level of clinical knowledge on the part of the doctor to
  interpret the computer result. In contrast, the ‘logical’ method
 requires the patient to provide information in answer to video-screen
 questions, as the program runs. The computer then produces its own
  result. So in principle, such programs could be run by GPs,
 para-medics and even by patients themselves rather than only by
  specialist medical consultants. The program would then be using the
 model of the doctor’s analytical techniques, in a so-called expert
  system, which could be used by non-expert diagnosticians.
 Automatic Analysis Equipment
 Much of this equipment is expensive technology for use in hospitals.
 Examples are ECG, ultrasound and computer tomography and
 automatic tissue-fluid analysers. But some equipment for use outside
  the hospital or surgery is also being developed. Electronic machines
  for the measurement of blood pressure and pulse rate are already
  easily available. In the USA, ambulatory ECG monitoring for home
  use has been introduced with a market in 1982 of $85m. Sciencare
 Corporation launched a pilot compact ECG monitor in March 1982.
  This device is worn by the patient twenty-four hours a day; it
 measures blood presure and electrocardiogram signals which are
  stored on a cassette tape to be replayed by a doctor at her or his
  surgery on a specialised scanner. Although each unit is sold for
  $2000, the cost could drop as the market grows so that it can be used
 by a larger number of patients. Substantial progress has been made in
 home blood-glucose monitoring for diabetics. Blood glucose-
 monitoring machines are micro-electronic devices which use a
 photo-electric method of measuring the reflectance of reagent strips
 before and after staining with a small amount of blood. These tests
  can be done by the diabetic at home or at work and replace or
 supplement urine-testing which is less accurate and less convenient.
  Since the introduction of the innovation in 1978 in the UK, doctors

```

-----

```
    and patients have realised the value of controlling the blood-sugar
    level helping to prevent blindness and renal failure which sometimes
    affect diabetics.
     At present the British government is involved in the development
    of home blood-glucose monitoring machines. The Department of
    Trade and Industry has supported the firm Hypoguard in_ its
    development of a blood-glucose monitor, ‘Hypocount’. Hypoguard
    also manufactures reagent strips for blood-glucose testing and use
    with the monitor. The company is now using its expertise gained
    through the development of Hypocount to manufacture micro-
    electronic counters for blind and partially-sighted diabetics. ‘Dia-
    data’ is a unit into which the diabetic enters up to thirty days of
    readings from the Hypocount, food intake and activity levels. The
    patient then takes her or his unit to the doctor whose master unit
    prints out the information with a summary of the patient's
    condition. '*
    Remote Monitoring
    For patients with some chronic illness or longer-term condition (like
    pregnancy) frequent visits to the doctor or hospital can be incon-
    venient. This is true particularly if the distance from home to hospital
     is large as it will be in countries with scattered rural populations
    (Australia, for example). However, using various electronic devices,
    many conditions can be monitored at the patient’s home, by the
    patient, and can be transmitted for hospital analysis via established
    telecommunications systems. We will give two examples from the
    UK. ECG monitoring of adults with dangerous heart conditions can
    be done ‘at a distance’. Patients, on suffering chest pains, can
    telephone the hospital and, using an ECG monitor similar to the one
    already mentioned, can transmit its results down the telephone to the
    hospital monitor. The doctor can establish whether any heart attack
     is imminent and dispatch an ambulance if it is. A similar experimental
    system is in use to monitor the foetal heart in pregnant women. By
    means of an electronic sonic detector, the woman picks up the foetal
    heartbeat and transmits it live via telephone or, it is planned, by radio
     to a hospital computer which analyses the signal to identify any
    potential malfunction of the foetal heart. The whole procedure takes
     thirty minutes. The cost advantages of such remote monitoring
    techniques seem large — even including the cost of telephone calls

 than 6 per cent of the daily cost of a hospital bed (which many of
 these patients would otherwise have to occupy to be under direct
 hospital surveillance). '”
   Clearly such developments, insofar as they increase the product-
  ivity of the health services, are likely to receive the support of
 health-care authorities who are trying to cope with slowly growing
 budgets. As they imply an increase in the capital-intensity of some
 aspects of that care they will also have some effects on employment
 and skill requirements in the health services. But they also offer new
 markets and, wherever the production sites are located, new jobs in
  the medical equipment, computer hardware and, particularly,
 software industries. The medical equipment industry is an expanding
  part of manufacturing. In Britain, the health-care products industry,
 which includes pharmaceuticals, is growing in real terms by around 7
  per cent annually, though certain high technology sub-sectors are
 expected to grow at a much faster rate than this overall figure. For
 example, it has been estimated that diagnostic imaging equipment
 production will have expanded by nearly 180 per cent between 1975
 and 1986.°°
   Will the widespread diffusion and use of information technologies
  of all kinds alter not just the way existing health services ‘deliver’
  their care but also the kind of [care ] [that ] [will ] [be ] [demanded ] [by ] [the ]
 population? Health care as a necessary [human ] [need ] [can ] [be ] [satisfied ]
  within limits, either by the formal [health ] [services ] [(like ] [the ] [NHS ] [in ][the ]
 UK) or by other informal systems [which ] [tend ] [to ] [rely ] [on ] [privately- ]
 produced marketed services [or ] [physical ] [products. ] [In ] [this ] [informal ]
  system at present there [is ] [an ] [increasing ] [emphasis ] [on ] [preventative ]
  health care and on ‘unorthodox’, [‘alternative’ ] [forms ] [of ][medical ] [care. ]
 Encouraged partly by state [campaigns ] [of ][health ] [education ] [and ] [by ][the ]

    switches breadmaking to wholemeal baking technologies; all of them
    stimulate new branches of publishing. In addition in the 1970s there
    has been a big increase in the number of people seeking health care
    advice outside the formal system. In the UK, the number of
    ‘approved’ practitioners of such techniques as osteopathy, herbalism,
    acupuncture, bio-feedback and faith healing has doubled over the
    past five years, to nearly 8000.7!
     The expansion of health services along preventative lines might be
    the only real way both to increase good health and reduce the cost of
    medical expenditure in the long run, as Doyal (1979) has pointed out.
    But although the importance of preventative aspects of medicine in
    Britain has been recognised by the state in terms of policy — though
    with little funding — it is the private sector which has moved into this
    vacuum with most speed.
     There are two possible scenarios conceivable in the development of
    these two health-care systems, the formal welfare service and
    informal preventative and private advice sectors. One assumes that
    the balance will remain much as it is now. There will be substantial
    productivity improvements in the formal sector which, although still a
    relatively labour-intensive service industry, whether state- or
    privately-financed will continue to provide for most people’s medical
    needs. (Some of course will still seek unorthodox advice and others
    (many) will continue to medicate themselves and participate in
    self-help activities.) The other assumes that whatever may happen in
    the welfare-service side of health care, the trends to self-service, to
    purchase equipment and information to care for one’s own health,
    will expand considerably, but will also be simultaneously restructured
    around information technologies.
     Over the next twenty years therefore there could be expanding
    markets for high technology health care products to be sold, not just
    to or through the formal health services — though this will be large
    market — but also on a mass-consumption scale to individual con-
    sumers directly. The development of these markets, implying the
    manufacture and maintenance of electronic equipment and the
    production of all kinds of software to run on it, offers the prospects of
    new employment at the same time as employment in the formal
    health service may not be growing, although whether such markets
    will be mass markets is an open question.
     The balance actually struck between the two modes of provision of
    health-care will depend on many factors; a crucial economic
    determinant however will be the balance of cost between the various

 modes. There are currently a number of options available to the
 would-be patient seeking, for example, diagnosis of some complaint:
 1. to seek the advice of a medical practitioner, either in the orthodox
   or unorthodox sectors;
  2. to seek free advice from friends, the pharmacist etc., and if
   necessary, purchase proprietary drugs;
 3. consult medical books and proceed as in 2).
   (1), (2) and (3) are in no way new options, the choice between
 them depending on a variety of factors, including the costs of
 consultation and of the alternative treatments. Clearly developments
 in medical equipment might reduce these costs or at least stop them
 growing. The next two, certain technological developments permit-
 ting, are new:
 4. consult bought or rented computer programs and/or perform
   routine tissue-fluid analysis/blood pressure (etc.) measurement
   and self-diagnose; and follow therapy outlined. (This could, of
   course be some unorthodox therapy recommended by the
   computer program which was specifically purchased with this in
   mind; or be a recommendation to consult some medical practi-
   tioner.)
 5. as (4) but the whole activity carried out at some self-diagnosis
   centre not necessarily connected with the formal health care
   system, but possibly provided by [private ] [health-check ] [companies. ]
  Clearly (4) and (5) are not economic options at the present time.”
 They rely upon the generalised possession and active use of, or access
 to, personal computers and on the provision of substantial informa-
 tion technology infrastructures. Although these are being installed
 and the diffusion of personal computers is becoming more rapid, it
 remains to be seen whether they could ever be used routinely for
 anything as sophisticated as the provision of health-care information.
 A critical technological factor would seem to be the availability of
 routine techniques of self-diagnosis. As described above, such
 techniques are currently being developed, although mostly for use in
 the formal health-care system. Nevertheless there are some signs that
 larger markets are being sought. Testing and self-monitoring
 equipment of various sorts is available — particularly for accurate
 measurement of blood pressure, pulse rate and some body-fluid
 analyses as well; but it is not yet particularly cheap. The link between
 hospital computer-aided diagnosis and home diagnosis has not yet

```

-----

```
    been commercially developed but during the next five years we can
    expect a growth both in the number and range of such systems,
    particularly as some of the conceptual problems are attacked by
    increasing research into ‘artificial intelligence’ (see Alvey Com-
    mittee, 1982; Feigenbaum and McCorduck, 1984).
     There are already a number of computerised diagnostic programs
    available to those with video-disc players and home computers. The
    pharmaceutical company Smith, Kline and French has produced an
    interactive video-disc to educate doctors in the field of gastro-
    enterology (The disc however is extremely expensive at £28 000). A
    number of computer software firms offer for sale computer programs
    designed to aid doctors in the diagnosis of various psychiatric
    conditions. (They are known as ‘HEADACHE’ and FREUD’).
    There are also a number of programs available to home-computer
    owners such as Network Computer Systems’ ‘First Aid Program’
    and Eastmead’s 100 program ‘Home Doctor’ series which, claims
    Eastmead, ‘aims to complement the services offered by the NHS by
    providing patients with a series of simple health programs which
    differentiate between those symptoms requiring medical attention,
    emergency and routine, and those which could safely be treated at
    home without help (Medical News, 7 April, 1983).7°
     Self-diagnosing computer programs are thus available but they are
    not very sophisticated and are certainly not able to recommend very
    detailed courses of treatment. Nevertheless these various techno-
    logical developments make the self-service option within health care
    more possible, subject of course to other economic and political
    decisions providing both the infrastructure and the incentives for
    their development as mass market commodities. Of course, it is
    possible to envisage various intermediate stages in any path of
    development to self-service diagnosis, etc. — the high cost, in the
    formal health-care system, of continued analysis for some conditions
    may make self-analysis technologies an economic option within a
    more cost-conscious health service. Computer-aided diagnostic
    systems may be best operated by para-medics, screening out patients
    with routine ailments but under the professional scrutiny of more
    highly-trained doctors possibly within a private health care system.
    Vital here will be the attitudes of the medical profession towards
    what is quite clearly a challenge to their monopoly over medical
    knowledge (Child et al., 1983). Whatever they do, it is quite
    conceivable that preventative health programs, of both the computer
    and video kind, compiled with keep-fit routines and information on

```

```
 healthier lifestyles could infiltrate the home via the computer, video
 and cable TV markets.
  Whatever are the various paths whereby such equipment will come
 into routine use outside the existing formal health-care system, it
 does seem clear that information technologies will change in some
 fashion the way the population seeks to satisfy its requirements for
 health care. The questions remain as how, to what extent and for
 which social groups? Of course, any increase in the informal,
 self-service sector will depend on the relative costs of the two sectors
 and this is linked to the policies of the health-care authorities, of the
 health insurance companies, and of the medical profession.
 CONCLUSION
 We have tried to show in this chapter how new electronic and
 telecommunications devices, with the appropriate software of course,
 can have profound implications for the way in which service
 production is organised over the next few decades. Indeed, far from
 the post-industrial scenario of a highly mechanised manufacturing
 sector supporting a huge, low productivity, labour-intensive sector of
 service work, information technologies provide one of the means in
 which the service sector itself can show large rises in productivity.
 The service sector is the site of major [upheavals ] [in ] [the ] [forms ] [of ]
 organisation of production in advanced capitalist societies.
   In clerical work, self-servicing externalisation and the welfare
 services, there are two aspects to these upheavals: first, the nature
 and structure of the services provided, in particular the changing mix
 of waged service labour, machinery and unpaid self-servicing labour,
 and second, the labour processes whereby the waged service labour
 delivers the service product. Information technologies do not of
 themselves determine the outcome of the struggles, between firms or
 between workers and managements, over these incipient changes,
 but they do change the range of options for profit-making in services
 and thus present new areas and issues over which the struggles can
 take place. So by making possible the more rapid processing of
 variable information by means of advanced computers and com-
 munication networks, types of service product which required
 relatively large numbers of experienced information-handling
 workers can be offered more cheaply.
  However, such productivity increases need not be gained by

```

-----

```
    Fordist organisational methods of job simplification and standardisa-
     tion within some hierarchical management system. Much more
    diverse forms of production and work organisation become possible,
    although we need not assume that the favourite of progressive
    management consultants — autonomous work-groups integrated by
    interactive computer networks—is the only one. As we have
    described, organisationally highly centralised but geographically
    dispersed forms of production organisation — such as ‘tele-outwork’ —
    despite their questionable advantages for the outworkers are equally
    possible, along with ‘satellite’ offices, for some types of clerical work
     at least. It is our contention that whatever organisational forms might
    be adopted to exploit the potential of information technologies, they
     will be best understood as marking a discontinuity with Fordist forms
    of organisation that have previously been devised for some service
     industries; hence our emphasis on neo-Fordism.
     But such reorganisation of service labour processes will imply
    changes in how the service product is delivered and indeed the nature
    of the service product itself. The externalisation of service labour,
    with individual consumers providing at least part of the service
    themselves, is already established in retailing and mass catering and is
     likely to expand rapidly into the information services as higher
    capacity telecommunication infrastructures are installed and
    domestic terminals and input devices fall in price.
     As we have tried to show in our admittedly rather speculative
    discussion of possible information technology-driven changes in
    medical diagnosis and health care, information technologies in their
    application are not just limited to improving the labour productivity
     of welfare services as presently delivered. Much more substantial
    changes, satisfying human service functions in radically new ways, are
    conceivable, although, as we have pointed out, such changes will not
    inevitably occur just because they can be imagined technologically.
    Nevertheless it is clear that as new profit opportunities are sought in
     the current depression, the application of information technologies to
    service industries is a prime candidate; changes in the modes of
     service delivery — the switch from labour-intensive service provision
     to new mixes of computer-based equipment with intermediate
     services and self-service labour—are at the centre of making
    information technologies profitable. Any upswing for capitalist
    economies must be based not just on some restructuring of existing
    industries but on finding new industries in which to make profits.

 8 Conclusion: From
  Fordism to Neo-Fordism?
  In this book we try to show and investigate seven things:
  1. We demonstrate how technological developments of the past
   hundred years can be seen as a progression of overlapping phases
   of primary, secondary and tertiary mechanisation, exemplified in
   particular leading industrial sectors; those developments seen
   within certain work organisational contexts, in labour processes,
   can be shown to link with long waves in capitalist economic
   growth.
     . We argue that the technological basis of the post-World War Two
   boom period of the fourth long wave can be seen as the
   generalisation of secondary mechanisation with the emergence, in
   a small number of industries, of tertiary mechanisation.
     . We identify Fordism as the dominant labour/production process
   paradigm of the boom period of the fourth long wave.
     . We see the depression of the 1980s as one of a crisis of a specific
   form of capital accumulation, based on particular Fordist produc-
   tion methods, products and consumption patterns which came
   from and led developed economies out of the depression of the
   1930s.
     . We examine the limits of Fordism and how these might be
   overcome using new technologies and emerging new forms of
   labour process organisation — the production process paradigm we
   characterise as neo-Fordism.
     . We look at emerging forms of neo-Fordism in small-batch
   production and in the service sector and how new technologies
   offer new ways to organise both production processes themselves
   and, most significantly, the products that are available for mass
   consumption.
    . We have argued that any resolution of the present crisis which
   maintains the viability of capitalist economies, restoring capital

```

```
     accumulation and producing a new upswing in the economy must
      involve further radical changes in production methods and in
     consumption patterns over the next decade.
      In pursuing these ideas we have sought to bring together two areas
    of thought - labour-process analysis and long-wave theory — to
    show, we hope, how an adequate understanding of the current
    economic crisis demands some comprehension and integration of the
    insights of both areas. So we would claim it is not possible to
    understand the nature of the current depression (or, if you like, the
    downswing in the current long wave) without noting the importance
    of changes in production processes, seen as combinations of specific
    technologies and specific forms of the organisation of work (and
    therefore of workers). Further, the ‘trigger factors’ which might
    stimulate any upturn cannot be read off from the pure technological-
    innovation options identified in the depression. Rather we have tried
     to show that, at least in previous lower turning-points, the crucial
    enabling factor in any upswing was a specific combination of those
    technological options with appropriate forms of labour organisation
    which offered better profit opportunities for expectant investors.
    Since labour organisation is inherently political, involving such things
     as the balance of power between capital and labour, the types of
    labour required and available, the regional distribution of industry —
     all matters of local, regional, national and international political
    concern — then political factors are as vital to the upswing as
    technological options. We see the political programmes being
    pursued by right-wing governments in OECD countries, particularly
     in Britain and the USA, at the present time in this way — as attempts
     to reduce the power and wages of organised labour by specific laws
    and actions against trade unions, by the discipline of large-scale
    unemployment and by the recasting of educational and welfare
    programmes to lower the subsistence levels of large numbers of the
    population. Of course, all such political events have unpredictable
    outcomes. Indeed, as we will discuss later, other possibilities which
    do not accept the priorities in the exploitation of new technology’s
    potential set by capitalist firms and their supporting governments, are
    conceivable.
     But nevertheless — and this we definitely insist on in this book —
     the technological options are not merely subordinate to these
     political or labour organisational factors. Scientific knowledge, and
    any technological innovations which might develop from it (although

```

-----

```
 not necessarily in the format: ‘science discovers, technology applies’)
 is not completely random and unplanned; capitalist firms, with
 government support, do their best to focus scientific and technolo-
 gical research and development on to soluble problems of product-
 innovation and productivity-increasing process design and infra-
 structural provision. But there is inevitably some indeterminacy in
 their planning attempts, for all sorts of reasons — not enough money,
 bad planning, choice of wrong problem, inadequacy of scientific
 knowledge, insufficient trained people. Only some research pro-
 grammes are successful, only some technological options are finally
 presented in an economically viable form as successful innovations.
 In short, technological options available to capitalist firms at a
 particular time are bounded, and although their choice and exploita-
 tion cannot ‘guarantee’ (and retrospectively cannot be seen as an
 ‘explanation’ of) any upswing, the other determining factors within
 the labour process cannot guarantee or explain it either. A study of
 the technological options which may be involved in a solution of the
 problems of the current depression can surely illuminate what
 broader political-economic options are open, so long as these options
 are seen as diffracted through changing production/labour processes.
 If seeing the importance of technological options makes us ‘technolo-
 gical determinists’, we accept the appellation.
   In discussing labour-process analyses of production changes this
 century we have argued for some broader dynamic framework for
 these changes. Braverman, from whom most labour-process analysis
 springs either to illustrate his general claims or to refine him by
 partial refutation, saw his discussion [of ] [the ] [causes ] [of ][the ] [“Degrada- ]
 tion of Work in the Twentieth Century’ (the sub-title of his book) as
 part of the broader process of [the ] [monopolisation ] [of ][capital ] [since ] [the ]
 nineteenth century. Many subsequent [studies ] [of ] [individual ] [cases ] [of ]
 the changes in skilling levels consequent [on ] [industrial ] [restructuring ] [or ]
 technological change have [not ] [brought ] [in ] [this ] [politico-economic ]
 dimension. Or if they have, [it ] [has ] [been ] [subordinate ] [to ] [perceived ]
 underlying trends in the [capitalist ] [economy ] [which ] [have ] [continued ] [to ]
 seek to divide conception [and ] [execution, ] [to ] [deskill ] [previously ] [skilled ]
 craft workers.
  We have challenged this idea of technological change having a
 deskilling dynamic under the constraints of accumulation and
 competition, in two ways. First, we have focused attention not on the
 labour-process analysts’ favourite of Taylorism, a mode of labour
 organisation and task allocation, but on Fordism which implies

```

-----

```
    certain forms of labour organisation and task allocation but within a
    broader framework which brings together the nature of the product,
    the market size and, linking with this, the forms of consumption of
    the wider working class as well. Second, in Chapter 4, we have tried
    to emphasise some periodicity in the development of capitalist labour
    processes over the past 150 years by identifying various phases in the
    trajectory of the mechanisation element of the labour process (which,
    we must repeat, we do not see as determined, in the crude unilinear
    sense, by machine developments); and we have attempted to link
    these mechanisation phases with even broader politico—-economic
    trends as exhibited in the upswings and downswings of long waves.
     We would not like to claim too much as the consequences of our
    analysis. By definition, by identifying the long-wave lower turning-
    point as historically contingent, much more so than the upper
    turning-point, no general projections of future developments can
    easily be made. We would not therefore feel secure in proposing
    specific policies to ‘bring forward the upswing’, though others have
    (Mensch, 1979, for example). However, we would claim that from an
    understanding of the trajectories of mechanisation and of the Fordist
    underpinnings of the past fifty years some general issues emerge for
    consideration by those like us who are concerned with political
    transformations within capitalist countries.
     Chapter 7 suggested that it is reasonable to ask whether the current
    economic crisis, the recession—depression phases of the long wave as
    some would say, is associated with some ‘exhaustion’ of the Fordist
    paradigm established with the 1950s’ boom. Have Fordist production
    processes reached some limit both technically and in terms of labour
    management? Are the forms of organisation and the patterns of
    consumption that constitute Fordism ‘appropriate’ for the optimally
    efficient use of the new information technologies? More particularly,
     is Fordism, the historical form of production organisation which
    corresponds to a certain stage in the development of mechanisation
    and a specific configuration of labour organisation, ‘suitable’ in the
    sense that it is appropriate for renewed accumulation, if information
    and other technologies are to be applied successfully to those sectors
    of production which have hitherto not benefited from it?
     There is a wide literature, dating from the late 1960s as we have
    described in Chapter 5, which suggests that Fordism (or Taylorism)
    has had its day. Work redesigners, job enrichers, socio-technical
    theorists have all argued that production processes based on
    ‘automation’, in firms which need to adapt more quickly to their

```

-----

```
  competitive environment, cannot depend upon techniques of man-
  agement organisation (mechanistic Fordism-Taylorism) devised in
  very different technological and competitive circumstances. How-
  ever, few have linked the crisis in Fordist systems to any Overarching
  economic crisis or any phase of longer-term economic cycles,
  preferring mainly to argue that the new production organisations are
  more humane, more mentally healthy, more democratic or more in
  tune with an educated, affluent, modern workforce.
   Gordon, Edwards and Reich, however, have indeed tried to do this
  in their examination of the history of the American working-class, or
  more particularly of its divisions. They examined the interaction
  between what they call ‘long swings’ in economic activity, the
  organisation of work, labour market structure and what they call
  ‘social structures of accumulation’. By the latter they mean the
  ‘specific institutional environment’ within which capital accumulation
  takes place. Long swings and social structures of accumulation are
  connected.’ As they state:
  We shall propose that long swing and social structures of
   accumulation are interdependent and mutually determining in
   capitalist economies. A long period of prosperity is generated by a
   set of institutions that provides a stable and favourable context for
   capitalists. This context must provide capitalists with both profit-
   able investment opportunities and a stable societal environment in
   which to realise them. The boom begins to fade when the
   profitable opportunities inherent within the existing social struc-
   ture of accumulation begin to dry up. . . Long swings are in a part
   a product of the success or failure of the social structure of
   accumulation in facilitating capitalist accumulation. (Gordon,
   Edwards and Reich, 1982, p. 9-10)
   The concept of social structure of accumulation needs further
  elaboration. Gordon et al. argued that it comprises three types of
  institutions. First, there are the systems which guarantee the supply
  and circulation of money and credit, the banking and finance
  systems. Second, there is the pattern of state involvement, whereby
  state institutions, either through tax allowances and _ industrial
  subsidies, procurement policies, [training ] [programmes ] [and ] [regula- ]
  tions assist in profit-making or, through laws and regulations
  restricting behaviour considered [socially ] [or ] [politically ] [unacceptable, ]
  reduce profit-making. Third, [there ] [is ] [the ] [political ] [system ] [through ]

    which class struggles — in unions, political parties, riots, pressure
    groups and elections — express themselves. They are of the view that
    what they call the ‘post-war system of bureaucratic control’ has
    slowed down US labour productivity and is thus involved in the
    current economic slump. Major structural changes in the American
    economy are necessary to produce a new social structure of
    accumulation which, American capitalists would hope, would enable
    some overall increase in social productivity and profitability and set
    accumulation on a new upward trend — in short to provide a new
    sustained upswing in the American economy, a new boom.
     Gordon et al. are only able to give the briefest indications of what
    US capitalists are experimenting with in institutional and production
    organisation change which might, in some combination yet to be
    fought out in political struggles in the USA, emerge as an appropriate
    social structure of accumulation. At the national level, they suggest
    that current Democratic Party flirtation with ideas like incomes
    policies and a semi-planned industrial policy might in some corpor-
     atist compromise be an essential element of any political settlement
    (Rohatyn, 1984). At the corporation level, it is possible that various
    forms of worker participation in management might in the longer
    term be necessary to get workers in unions in established industries to
    accept drastic restructuring; also, the growing interest in ‘Japanese’
    forms of management might presage some adoption of such methods,
    both in terms of shop-floor organisation and in the growth of
    labour-disciplining sub-contracting. Freeman has similarly suggested
    that for any economic upturn a large number of institutional changes
    are required, involving changes in:
     the pattern of skills of the workforce and therefore in the education
     and training systems; in management and labour attitudes; the
     pattern of industrial relations and worker participation; in working
     arrangements; in the pattern of consumer demand; in the
     conceptual framework of economists, accountants and govern-
     ments, and in social, political and legislative priorities. (Freeman,
     1983b)
     Gordon et al. also argue that any new social structure of
    accumulation would be ‘deeply affected by recent developments in
    technology’. They claim:
     Although it is still difficult to discern the implications for the social

```

-----

```
   relations of production, it is clear that recent technical innovations
   such as robotisation and the proliferation of micro-electronic
   equipment, carry profound potential implications for the organisa-
   tion of work and the relative power of managers and workers.
   (Gordon et al., 1982, p. 221)
  We have tried to elaborate on these recent technological develop-
  ments in this book but we have said little about any emergent social
  structure of accumulation, either in the USA, Britain or at the
  general international level. The concept of Fordism we have
  presented, whilst clearly implying an appropriate social structure of
 accumulation — so as to provide necessary credit for large-scale
  purchases of mass produced goods or to provide appropriate
  infrastructures and welfare programmes for example — is not in-
  tended to specify all the necessary institutions in a social structure of
  accumulation. Instead we have chosen to keep Fordism to a
  description of a process of labour organisation and associated
 consumption patterns.
   If the last boom can be characterised as being structured on the
  combination of a specific technological form (the phase of the
  maturation of secondary mechanisation and the emergence of control
  mechanisation) and a specific system of labour organisation, all
  within the Fordist production process, on what might any new boom
  be structured? As Chapters 5, 6 and 7 argue, we see neo-Fordism
  within production processes as the likely combination. Neo-Fordism
  has three elements: the technological element of control mechanisa-
  tion which permits the mechanisation, at high levels of productivity,
  of more flexible production of a higher variety of products; the
  labour-organisational element confers [greater ] [choice ] [in ][the ] [combina- ]
  tion of tasks into jobs and [work-roles ] [thus ] [moving ] [away ] [from ]
  individual repetitive jobs; the [informational ] [infrastructure ] [element ]
  permits the integration of different [productive ] [sub-units ] [by ][electronic ]
  methods. In addition, we have [argued ] [for ] [seeing ] [changing ] [patterns ] [of ]
  consumption, particularly of [service ] [industries, ] as an aspect of
  neo-Fordism.
   As Aglietta has pointed out, the current economic crisis is partly a
  result of the ‘crisis’ of Fordism comprising both the resistance of
  workers to Fordist work organisation and barriers to the extension of
 Fordism into small-batch capital-goods production and the produc-
  tion of labour-intensive services, particularly those collectively
 consumed. Given the extent of this crisis, the process of the

```

-----

```
    restructuring of capitalist economies for a new upswing would have to
    overcome these complex and interrelated barriers to accumulation.
   We have discussed these in Chapters 6 and 7 in relation to possible
    neo-Fordist changes. However, neo-Fordist developments do not
    rule out the further extension of Fordist systems to production pro-
    cesses in newly industrialised manufacturing sectors in developing
    countries — what Lipietz (1982) has called ‘global Fordism’. He
    argues that since Fordist production processes separate out the
    unskilled assembly of products from the skilled production of parts
    and the conceptual tasks of design and planning, then in pursuit of
    lower costs these different parts of any process can be located in
    different countries. Firms in mass-production industries have thus
    sought out sources of cheap labour in the so-called ‘newly indus-
    trialising countries’ (NICs) and have applied Fordist and Taylorist
    techniques to labour organisation there. Whether this will continue in
    the NICs and spread to other third world countries critically depends
    on the struggles of workers in those countries to raise wages and resist
    the worst features of Fordist mass-production organisation (what
    Lipietz calls ‘bloody Taylorisation’). But it also depends on political
    and economic developments in the advanced countries. Neo-Fordist
    changes, apart from offering markets for new manufactured goods
    and intermediate consumer services, are associated with the reorga-
    nisation of those industrial sectors not yet transformed along Fordist
    lines. It is possible to envisage neo-Fordism in the advanced capitalist
    countries coexisting with Fordism in the NICs, though we do not
    insist on the division.
     To conclude we shall now summarise our discussions drawing out
    some broader conclusions indicating the issues our analysis would
    suggest will be on the political agenda over the next ten years. We
    refer to issues concerning the response of workers, particularly ‘craft’
    workers in both the conceptual and executive aspects of production,
    to the introduction of new technology into their workplaces and
    concerning changes in service provision in the public sector that
    consumption restructuring signals.
   WORKERS’ STRUGGLES AND THE PROBLEM OF ‘CRAFT”
    As we have already pointed out, product changes and productivity
    increases in capital goods production have ‘ripple’ effects through all
    sectors of the economy because of the lowered cost of machinery or
    the increased productiveness of new capital goods produced. Such a

```

```
  process is a continuous one but in a depression, as firms rationalise
 and as profit expectations change, there is an opportunity for a
 wholesale re-equipping of production processes, using machinery
  based on newer technologies. This point is crucial to a characterisa-
  tion of technological change during a depression period leading to an
 upswing and forms the basis for our stress on developments in
  mechanisation. “As we demonstrated the potential increases in
  productiveness which particular new technologies bring about are not
  achievable without wholesale changes in the products, organisation
  and techniques of production within particular branches of industry.
  The scale and problems of such changes and thus the actual rate of
  change have not been appreciated by many writers describing the
  likely timescale of the micro-electronic revolution who assume the
  widespread use of ‘bolt-on’ labour-displacing control systems in
  manufacturing industry and the computerisation of white-collar
  functions leading to ‘automated’ factories and massive unemploy-
  ment.
   Periods of restructuring, then, result in the emergence of new
  industries but also involve related shifts in techniques of production
  in many existing industries. As we have shown, this is the case with
  small-batch engineering where this ‘backward’ sector (in that it did
  not go through a Fordist phase of development) is being ‘leapfrogged’
  into a neo-Fordist phase by the use of computerised technologies. A
  similar case might be made for printing in the British national
  newspaper industry as well as for many other so-called ‘sunset’
  industries; neo-Fordist techniques could well allow them to rise
  again, rather than be effectively relocated to other countries,
  although levels of employment would still be lower than in those
  industries during the last boom.
   Such neo-Fordist developments put in doubt the trajectory of
  ‘deskilling’ that might have been observed previously or might have
  been expected as Fordism ‘crept’ into those industries. Those who
  identify such Fordist tendencies, such as Kraft (1977) in computer
  software production, Cooley (1980) in engineering design work or
  Barker and Downing (1980) in clerical work, suggest that deskilling
  should be resisted and existing craft-based job-roles should be
  defended. However they do not necessarily reject the use of new
  technologies completely, suggesting instead ‘capturing’ strategies in
  which the new technologies are operated by existing workers under
  their control (a strategy which has been tried with some success by
  predominantly male typesetting workers in Fleet Street).

```

```
     There is certainly much scope for the further development of these
    strategies if you assume, as we do, accepting many of the arguments
    of socio-technics writers discussed in Chapter 5, that the organisa-
    tional choices in the use of new technologies that managements make
    are not always the most appropriate even for assured profit-making.
    The design of software to operate the technological infrastructure of
    neo-Fordist systems is one area where design criteria ‘alternative’ to
    those currently conceived by managements can be invoked. Some
   Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) systems incorporate
    routines for carrying out synthetic timing of jobs (‘built-in time and
    motion study’) a political choice by management to embody in the
    system some means to control piecework payments. Yet, rather than
   CAM taking the form of a one-sided management information system
    which collects data on the work-performance of individuals for
    disciplinary purposes as well as monitoring and co-ordinating the flow
    of work through a machine shop, the former functions can be
    eliminated from a system in the process of bargaining over its
    introduction. Further, attempts by management to restrict access to
    the database, excluding shop-floor workers, are also negotiable. The
    relative technical ease of modifying informational systems opens up
    opportunities for the extension of collective bargaining to wider
    issues than pay and conditions. Compared with the difficulties of
    contesting the design and layout of production machinery where
    these had limited flexibility, there is a high degree of choice in design
    and operation of the new computerised machines and information
    systems.
     However, to contest change of this substantial technical kind
    requires considerable expertise regarding the likely effects of the new
    systems being installed and possible alternative forms of utilising
    them; this expertise tends to be concentrated in technical workers
    who, while becoming more unionised in recent years, have generally
    failed to ally themselves to broader working-class movements and
    tend to have a technocratic view of the use of new technology. It is
    surely an important priority for trade unions in all countries to
    develop structures and procedures whereby the expertise in computer
    systems design and associated technological infrastructures can be
    obtained and workers in possession of that expertise be encouraged
    to consider alternative design criteria.*
     Such strategies, to regulate the introduction of new technologies
    into existing industries and seeking alternative design criteria, can
    only be partly successful however, for these reasons. The severing of

```

-----

```
 the Fordist link between mass-production and economies of scale,
 allowing the production at lower costs of smaller but still economic
 batches of both goods and, most significantly, services — which until
 now have depended on physical concentrations of workers in large
 production units — is one of the technological bases of the possible
 reconstitution of production on a new basis. The number of workers
 required may be reduced (per unit of output and thus, unless markets
 expand substantially, absolutely); the types of skills required may be
 different and may thus be found from different pools of labour-power
 in different locations.* But communication problems, the informa-
 tional links between sub-units of an overall production system or
 between a system and its suppliers will be made easier by advanced
 electronic devices and telecommunications infrastructures.*
  Thus ‘deskilling’ can occur not through direct confrontation of new
 technologies with craft workers but rather through industrial rationa-
 lisation and redundancy, in parallel with the introduction of new
 employment using different, cheaper, more amenable workers.
 Further, much new technology is likely to be introduced into the
 service sector, and it is traditionally in those sectors where union
 membership is low and, in particular, there is a low level of craft
 union tradition.
  However, focusing on craft strategies in resisting and controlling
 new technology reveals their divisive nature. Strategies for controlling
 labour supply through, for example, apprenticeships and closed
 shops with restricted conditions of access, or for ensuring a supply of
 work through, for example, demarcation, have succeeded in the past
 but at the expense of less well-organised sections of labour (see
 Elger, 1979 and Cockburn, 1983). There are real differences of
 interests between sections of the working class, so it is necessary to
 devise new forms of democratic decision-making within which these
 differences can be resolved rather than concentrating on further
 developing competitive strategies.
  In fact in view of the radical cross-sectional implications of new
 technologies, we would argue that it is often impossible to devise
 successful employee strategies at the level of occupational group or,
 often, even at the level of a particular firm or industry. One of the
 most innovative political developments of recent years has been the
 emergence of workers’ plans within large firms in particular
 industries. This type of strategy emphasises [wide ] grass roots
 involvement in the construction [of ] [alternative ] [corporate ] [plans. ] [The ]
 plans incorporate alternative decision-making [criteria ] [in ][the ] [design ] [of ]

```

```
    products, organisation of production and R&D policy which are
    oriented to the provision for social need, democratic control of produc-
     tion and participation in choices associated with the process of
    research and development. Such ideas have been taken up in recent
    years by left-wing local authorities in many countries, a prime
    example being Greater London Council.°
     There are of course a number of difficulties in the construction of
    such alternative corporate plans. Not least, is the problem that in
    many firms research and development as such is actually carried out
     in the firms of their capital goods suppliers, many of which may be
    foreign-based or foreign-owned. In Europe, as Holland (1983) and
    Radice (1984) have pointed out, this implies that radical policies
    which are seriously to affect the strategies of large corporations are
    pointless if restricted to the level of national states —- a European
    dimension is more than ever necessary to control the introduction of
    new technologies.
    SERVICES, JOBS AND WELFARE
    Whereas production in the expanding industries of the post-World
    War Two era was very labour-intensive, the new micro-electronic-
    based goods of the 1980s will be produced in highly mechanised
    plants which are hardly likely to absorb the labour surplus from the
    job-shedding industries of the past ten years. Worse, as we have
    pointed out, mechanisation within service industries would seem to
    point to extensive job-loss in these industries which up to recently
    have been expanding in employment. Some have responded to this
    by arguing against the introduction of such job-destroying new
    technologies in the first place; others, accepting the ‘inevitability’ of
    technological change, suggest that the introduction of new techno-
     logies should be planned and ways found to cope with the large number
     of otherwise permanently unemployed by the better distribution of
    existing working time and by ‘education for leisure’.
     Gershuny and Miles (1983) have yet another view. They argue that
    with the installation of the telecommunication infrastructures cur-
    rently under way (digital transmission systems, cable TV, satellites)
    many direct producer and consumer services will indeed experience
    rapid rises in productivity which will cut their costs and more than likely
     their employment. But there are considerable prospects for new
    employment in industries which supply the hardware that will plug in

```

-----

```
 to the new telecommunications infrastructures, such as home
 computers. More intriguingly, new jobs might come from new service
 industries that will produce the software in the forms of TV
 programmes, computer programs and information packages — the
 so-called ‘intermediate service products’ — that consumers will use to
 satisfy those service functions which are at the moment still provided
 by direct service industries. So in this ‘social innovation scenario’,
 investment in a new, large-scale but flexible telecommunications
 infrastructure may not produce many jobs in the short run but in the
 longer run there would be many jobs in the production and
 distribution of software. Initially, the new domestic equipment
 installed in each household would be for entertainment and for
 further education. However, some services might grow as informa-
 tion about them became more accessible (for example, fringe arts,
 library reference); others might spring up later, such as computerised
 car-sharing pools, community shopping. (The list is not long.) If such
 constructive leisure facilities presented themselves, then reduced
 working-hours might be more acceptable, increasing the attractive-
 ness of job-sharing and, acceptable wage-levels permitting, reduce
 unemployment somewhat. There would thus be an employment shift
 to the provision of intermediate consumer services.
  Gershuny and Miles’ scenario therefore sees service provision as
 being transformed from a different direction by the diffusion of
 information technology equipment into households to substitute for
 those services previously externally provided but now either cut back
 or too expensive. Services become [software ] [commodities ] [purchased ]
 to run on mass-produced information [technology ] [devices. ] [So, ] [as ] [new ]
 technologies profoundly change [the ] [means ] [of ] [producing ] [physical ]
 goods and services, new consumption [patterns ] [are ] [also ] [established ]
 that imply a radically different mix of service-provision. The
 self-service trend provides [new ] [markets ] [in ] [the ] [medium ] [term ] [for ]
 manufactured goods and [new ] [consumer ] [services ] [all ] [of ] [which, ] [after ]
 some unknown transitional [period ] [and ] [after ] [some ] [changes ] [in ] [the ]
 length of working day/week/year/life, [forms ] [the ] [technological ] [core ] [of ]
 a new socio-technical [system ] [that ] [is ] [the ] [basis ] [of ] [a ] [new ] [capitalist ]
 boom. At the same [time ] [a ] [wide ] [variety ] [of ] [services ] [previously ]
 provided by the [state ] [— ] [in ] [education ] [and ] [health ] [care ] [for ] [example ] [— ]
 are, in a radically new technological form, brought into the
 household along with [other ] [information ] [services, ] [creating ] [new ] [large ]
 markets of individual [consumer ] [purchases ] [for ] [private ] [firms, ] [permit- ]
 ting a reduction [in ] [state ] [provision ] [yet ] [further. ]

```

```
     Now clearly this self-service scenario for a capitalist resurgence is
    not an unmixed blessing. As Gershuny and Miles point out there are
    crucial questions to be asked about distribution and access (what
    social groups will be the first and the largest beneficiaries of this
    change of service provision and who will be the losers? What regional
    disparities will be intensified? How will privacy be ensured?). One
    might add, how is the neo-Fordist self-service trend tied in with the
    trends to returning various caring services ‘to the community’ or
    towards more ‘homework,’ both of which hide the reality of the
    increased burdens such trends place on women — for self-service read
    ‘housebound-women serviced’?
     There are of course many open questions. For example, how
    should the information infrastructures upon which new products and
    services depend, be designed. In principle it is possible to envisage
     political campaigns through which social rather than market criteria
    can be brought to bear on what telecommunications options are
    selected. However, whereas one can keep an open mind regarding
    information technology’s potential to assist such things as ‘citizen
     initiatives to achieve self-managed health’ and _ tele-information
    systems which provide social security claimants with better informa-
     tion on their rights, etc., it is not clear what one’s attitude should be
     to the very idea of the restructuring of services along neo-Fordist
     lines. In the current political situation, as we have tried to show in our
    discussion of health care, it comes within the context of the cutting of
     the collectivised non-marketed services without it being obvious that
    better alternatives for the majority of the population are going to
    be on offer from the information technology sector. The rising
     cost of the public services and the bureaucratic administration of them
    which encourages people to seek ‘private’ alternatives, whether
    these be private direct services (such as, private medical care) or
    information technology-assisted self-services, pose political ques-
     tions.
      It is reasonable to argue that the trend to the self-service,
    ‘commoditised’ provision of service functions has in many cases gone
    too far already. In transport, for example, the disbenefits of mass
    individual automobile use have long been known — an increase in the
    provision of collectively-provided services by an expansion of
    metropolitan transport systems, perhaps using information techno-
     logies to facilitate booking and routeing, etc., might make more sense
     in terms of resource usage and urban planning (see Best and Connolly,
     1982, p. 86-92). And as it is inevitably more labour-intensive than

```

```
 manufacturing goods and less skill-intensive than software produc-
 tion the prospect for job creation may be better.
  The reconstruction of consumption in those services that were
 reorganised in the last boom is, however, uneven. In Europe,
 although as much as 80 per cent of expenditure on travel is accounted
 for by the purchase and running of motor cars, 20 per cent is still used
 to purchase final transport services. Part of these will be accounted
 for by non-domestic consumption which is undertaken by choice, for
 example, train travel rather than car travel for long distances.
 However, the rest is accounted for by the failure of provision by
 Fordist commodities of public transport for the poor, elderly or
 disabled — or members of a household who do not have privileged
 access to the family car. For these non-consumers the provision of
 collective services is crucial and thus the relative reduction in these
 services over the post-war boom is the other side of the Fordist
 expansion of markets.
  For many services, their low productivity, reflecting low capitalisa-
 tion and difficulties in transformation, has resulted in a significantly
 low rate of profit and limitations in the market growth of many of
 these final services. In an attempt to respond to the high costs of
 service provision and delivery, both private firms and the state have
 responded by tapping low-wage segments of the labour market. By
 using young workers, part-time labour (often married women with
 child-care and domestic responsibilities) or ethnic labour at a
 disadvantage in the labour market, many services have been
 populated with low-wage workers [with ] [little ] [training ] [in ][an ] [attempt ] [to ]
 increase profits in absolute terms.
  This is particularly visible in low-skill service sectors such as
 cleaning, catering and retailing. But it also applies to the lower levels
 of professional services too. In state services, where labour organisa-
 tion tends to be easier, it has been possible for workers to raise their
 wages and improve conditions a little, in comparison with other
 service occupations in retailing and private cleaning firms. Where
 profits are high in services, this is at the expense of the majority of
 service workers and the cost to users of services in terms of price and
 quality. It is clear that the necessary condition for this situation to be
 changed must be a way of breaking the blockage to productivity
 increases in service provision and delivery. Obviously, information-
 technology-driven mechanisation is one such way; but what is not
 certain is the effect of such changes on wage levels, if service workers
 are not better organised.

```

```
     But to say this is not to suggest that information technologies have
    no role to play in providing better and more extensive public services.
    Campaigns to maintain or restore high levels of public provision and
     to introduce more democratic forms of management of the services,
    however vital, need some view on how new technologies can be
    utilised to improve the productivity of those services. Such produc-
     tivity improvements can allow the increased wages of service workers,
     as well as providing the basis of an extension of public service in more
    labour-intensive functions. Successful application of information
    technologies to ensure some historic increase in productivity in the
    various sectors we have discussed (thus possibly contributing to some
    upswing in economic growth in capitalist economies) depends on the
    successful assembly of the elements of neo-Fordist configurations of
    production organisation. The exact forms of such configurations are a
    matter for speculation; in addition, it is not assured that such a
    configuration will be put together as there are technological and
    labour organisation problems. The labour problems, which vary from
    country to country, are concerned with such matters as the
    availability of labour at the right wage levels and with the necessary
     skills, and these in turn are linked to national and international
    economic and political developments. The resolution of these
    problems in favour of capital is not reducible to the technological or
    labour organisational level. In that they involve political and
    economic struggles it is possible that different political conceptions of
    production and industrial organisation could make their mark. What
    we have tried to show in this book is that although people make
     history it is useful to examine from which options, in this case
    centring on technological ones, they have to choose.

              . An alternative way of stating this is that a consistent increase in
       productivity of labour is central to the ability of the economy to follow an
       equilibrium growth path.
              . This section is based on material from sources listed in Note 1 (Chapter
       3) drawing principally on Landes (1969).
             . There were exceptions, such as in some branches of the armaments
       industry which — for example in the USA — had been using interchange-
       able parts since the 1820s. Such developments were called by their
       British admirers the ‘American system of manufactures’; see Smith
       (1977).
          Nn . It is indeed curious that, even though ‘Fordism’ has been used by many
       writers to describe aspects of production organisation from the 1920s,

```

```
   there has been no attempt to define it more rigorously. The principal
   sources are, of course, the writings of Henry Ford himself (1922, 1929).
  A fascinating contemporary analysis of Fordism’s (or ‘Americanism’s’)
   political significance is by Gramsci (in Hoare and Nowell Smith, 1971,
   pp. 279-388). Other discussions of Fordism are Sohn-Rethel (1978),
   Palloix (1976), Sabel (1982) and Dunford and Perrons (1983).
    . From 1929 to 1939 the proportion of houses connected to electricity
   supply rose frony 20 per cent to 70 per cent in Britain and from 45 per
   cent to 90 per cent in Germany (Hannah, 1979). From 1930 to 1948 the
   proportion of consumer expenditure on domestic electrical appliances
   went up nearly eightfold in Britain; by 1948, 86 per cent of households
   possessed an electric iron, 64 per cent an electric fire and 40 per cent a
   vacuum cleaner. The market for electrically-powered consumer durables
   between the wars in Britain and the USA is discussed in Corley (1966)
   and Cowan (1976). The rise of new industries in the inter-war period is
   described in Aldcroft (1970), Pollard (1969), Cook and Stevenson (1979)
   and Dunford and Perrons (1983).
    . See Beynon (1973), Rothschild (1973), Linhart (1981) and Kamata
   (1983) for descriptions of conflict in British, American, French and
   Japanese car plants. Though no less real, the conflicts can be less
   dramatic in other industries; see Pollert (1981), Herzog (1980) and
   Nichols and Beynon (1977).
    . Aglietta seems to be either ill-informed or else to have chosen
   unfortunate terminology in his description of this hardware; he refers to
  DNC as a transfer line (1979: p. [125). ] [His ] [grasp ] [of ][the ] [consequences ] [of ]
   mechanised control is accurate, however.
     . Sabel (1982) discusses changes in some high volume industries stimulated
   by changing markets and the arrival of more flexible technologies.
  MECHANISATION AND LONG WAVES
    . In our discussions in this chapter we assume some knowledge of the basic
   evidence for long waves (see van Duijn (1983) for a review); recent
   discussions and elaborations of long wave theories are in Freeman
   (1983a). Long-wave theories are far from being accepted by all
   economists (see Maddison, 1982 and Beenstock, 1983). Scepticism arises
   from the statistical problems of testing the theory; and, one might
   suggest, from the long-standing project of neo-classical economists to
   elaborate a theory of equilibrium growth. Such a theory might possibly
   tolerate some fluctuations of an exogenous character in the time-path of
   the equilibrium, but would not tolerate endogenous cyclical fluctuations
   of a long duration. There are other problems in establishing the validity
   of the long wave which are cogently discussed by Rosenberg and
   Frishstack (1983).

      smoother, though not continuous, gradation of innovation types; see
      Freeman (1982) and Abernathy and Utterback (1975).
            . Rowthorn (1976) has criticised Mandel’s model; he has pointed out the
      imprecise nature of Mandel’s notion of ‘idle capital piling up’ from cycle
       to cycle in anticipation of radical investment projects in the further
       future. The practical question of the actual location and forms of this
       capital is not clearly dealt with by Mandel. Is it money-capital (in banks)
       or is it temporarily under-valued assets which are later realised in the
      context of enhanced profit expectations?
              . The resemblance of Mandel’s approach to the ‘random shocks’ approach
       of Maddison (1982) is more apparent than real. For Mandel, exogenous
       factors are important mainly at the lower turning point but for Maddison,
      who sees no evidence of waves at all, long depressions and long booms
       are explained by much more contingent factors.
            . There are great similarities with the model of the relationship between
      innovation and industrial development proposed by Abernathy and
      Utterback (1975) who note that the development of an industrial unit on
       the basis of one radical innovation progressively creates obstacles to any
       other radical innovation in that unit.
             . Freeman points out that not all technologies might follow this sequence
       and, despite the supposed general world synchronisation of the long
      wave, particular technologies might be following different time-paths in
       different countries. He cites as an example the difference in time
      between the booms in the US and European car industries.
             . Most of the pitfalls concern the manner in which the product titles are
      chosen, and become embedded in the Standard Industrial Classification
      scheme which is used for the presentation of Census of Production data.
      Within any particular branch of the classification scheme, a sub-category
       such as, say, machine tools will of course encompass a large variety of
       actual machines. If this category were not broken down further, it would
       be of little use for the present purpose. Fortunately, it is broken down
       into many sub-categories. The choice of these further sub-divisions is
       partly dictated by some obvious production-sequence discontinuity, such
       as that between drilling machines and milling machines, and partly by the
       possibility of some identifiable group of machines achieving a particu-
       larly significant fraction of production. In general both these criteria
      have to be present before the census organisers revise their categories to
      incorporate a new sub-division. Revisions are anyway conducted only
       infrequently, and the achievement of these criteria is dependent on the
      product being by common consent an ‘established’ product.
       Therefore, the Census categories themselves are a double-edged
      sword as indicators of technical change. On the one hand, the
      appearance and gradual rise to significant fractional share of a new
      category in the Census is a very reliable indicator of the middle and later
       portions of the diffusion curve of that product. On the other hand, there
       can be a significant and randomly variable delay between the real
      appearance of the new product and its appearance as a census category.
      Therefore, the new categories might be very poor guides to the very early
       portions of their diffusion curves. This feature of the way in which the

```

-----

```
    categories of the Census evolve is therefore a major constraint to be
    borne in mind when using their data for a purpose such as the present
    one.
    A further problem lies in the actual nomenclature of the Census
    categories and its interpretation. The term chosen by the Census to
    describe two closely related types of machine may be ambivalent with
    respect to the technical property in which we happen to be interested.
    So, while ‘pressure vessels’ made in the ‘fabricated platework’ industry
    will be quite likely to find their way into continuous flow in production
    industries, ‘tanks’ made in the same industry will presumably be used in
    the variety of applications beyond our particular concern of continuous
    flow production; and there is no information in the Census to help to
   determine the distribution of tanks between various applications. Here
    we are forced to use all of one category in our calculations and none of
    the other, when neither assumption is likely to be completely accurate.
     The last problem with the data is that of measurement. Our objective
    is to identify that fraction of machinery which falls into our several
    categories of mechanisation and to express its quantity as some sort of
    proportion to the total amount of machinery, of all sorts, produced in
    each Census year. In this way we hope to generate a time-profile of the
    process of mechanisation as revealed by the structure of the output of the
    capital goods industries. But how are we to express the proportion? If we
   work in terms of numbers of machines we encounter enormous problems
    of incommensurability. It is hardly appropriate to count both the
    complete transfer line and a single lathe as one unit of account, yet there
    is no simple conversion factor. It seems obvious then to use value as a
    yardstick. The problem here is that the relative price of the new
   commodity generally changes in a manner different from a general trend
    of price movements in any period. Therefore, £1m of NC machine tools
    will not bear the same relation to the total output of the machine tool
    industry in 1963 as in 1965 for example. The significance of this
    complication varies depending upon what one is looking for from the
    data. In one sense it represents useful information, since the high relative
    prices of new goods at the beginning of their life-cycles contain in part
    the temporary surplus profits which are the very stimulus to production
    which is associated with cyclical theories of new product generation.
   Thus the potential ‘inflation’ of our measure of the volume of
   mechanised equipment is not simply [‘false’, ] [it ][has ] [a ][complex ] [significance. ]
    For further discussion of these problems, see Coombs (1982).
      . It is nevertheless interesting to note that the mathematical and analytical
    foundations of Control Theory, so fundamental to the later development
    of practical electronic control devices were given a large push in the early
    1930s by Nyquist and Hazen. Modern control theorists regard their work
    as vital for the transition from what they call mere ‘sequence controlled
   mechanisation’ to ‘genuine automation’ (Healey, 1975: chap. 1). This
    distinction corresponds to the terminology of secondary mechanisation
    as compared with control or tertiary mechanisation used in this book.

      and peripheral roles draw on different sectors of the workforce; see
      Gordon ef al. (1982) for a discussion of segmentation in American
       industry.
             . See Thompson (1967), Williamson (1975), Galbraith (1977) and Perrow
      (1979).
     10. Of interest here is the fact that the realisation of such work intensifica-
       tion and responsibility for quality was dependent on such factors as the
      existence of individualised payment systems and a reduction of the role
      of ancillary workers. Kelly argues that this can be held to account for
      productivity increases with more plausibility than can the effects of
       ‘satisfaction’ postulated by job redesign theorists.
     11. For example, see Hackman and Oldham (1980) and Lupton (1975).
     12. See examples from the ‘micro-electronics revolution’ debate in Green
      (1984).
             . Thus it is not clear that level 7 (remote control of a power tool) is more
      ‘mechanised’ than level 6 (fixed sequence control over power tool).
       Similarly, is the mechanisation of workpiece insertion on a fixed
      sequence machine more mechanised than a hand-fed machine with some
      kind of workpiece measurement capability? Bell’s 3-D model of
      mechanisation with independent scales avoids this problem in Bright’s
       scalar classification.
     14. For example see Nichols and Beynon (1977) for a description of the
      heavy manual work which can still exist within a supposedly automated
      chemical plant.

  16. An exception is Sabel (1982) who discusses the work organisation aspects
    of neo-Fordism in the context of the ‘end of Fordism’. He draws his
   examples from a number of industries, almost entirely in manufacturing,
    seeking to show that even Fordist mass production firms are required to
   respond to the demands of flexibility. Though neo-Fordism can be
    discussed in relation to existing Fordist-organised industries, we prefer to
  rae se its special significance for the sectors we discuss in Chapters 6
    and 7.

  NEO-FORDISM IN SMALL-BATCH ENGINEERING
      . In the case of skilled labour shortages much of the blame must lie with
   inadequate levels of apprentice training; see Engineering Industry
   Training Board (1975), National Economic Development Office (1980)
    and Noble (1979: p. 42).
      . Reviews of GT appear in Edwards (1971), Gallagher and Knight (1973),
   National Economic Development Office (1975) and Burbidge (1975).
   Examples of it are described in Ranson (1972), Marklew (1970, 1972a,
    1972b) and Craven (1974). Criticisms of these expositions of GT can be
   found in Bornat (1978) and Green (1978).
      . This is especially so in the case of British metal-cutting craft workers, as
    described by Penn (1982) and More (1980).
      . If skilled workers carry out the handling and loading tasks, the skilled
    content of their work is likely to be increased by the removal of these
    less-skilled transfer functions. [It ] [is ] [possible ] [that ] [this ] [may ] [result ] [in ] [the ]
   displacement of some skilled workers [assuming ] [no ] [increase ] [in ][output, ] [yet ]
    given the volume of work necessary [to ] [amortise ] [any ] [such ] [investment ] [in ]

      . In April 1984, the Japanese Agency of Industrial Science and
   Technology opened a ‘dream factory of the twenty-first century’ in
   Tsukuba, near Tokyo, in which ‘the only human roles are inspection
   and sweeping the floor’. (The Guardian, 17 April 1984, p. 25). The
    Financial Times, 3 November 1984, p. 9, however, reports that an earlier
    version of this factory had not proved itself economically. Although the
   number of employees had been reduced from 215 to 12 and the
    processing time from 35 to 1.5 days the financial return over the first two
    years was less than $7m. on an investment of $18m. What is more, a
    survey conducted by Ingersoll Engineers showed that only two or three
    of the fifty Flexible Manufacturing Systems in Japan, Europe and the
   USA seemed financially viable. For a review of Japanese developments
    in ‘mechatronics’ (‘the combination of micro-electronics and mechanical
    engineering’) by Japanese and European engineers and industrialists see

   USA and Europe (both Western and Eastern).

    INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, THE SERVICE

            . It should be said that voice-driven electronic equipment is in the very
       earliest stages of its diffusion. A ‘voice-driven financial spreadsheet’
      software package is now on sale in Europe (at £1000) with which ‘a user
      can give commands, enter data, perform ‘“‘what if?” analyses, insert or
      delete rows of information . . . just by talking to the system through a
      microphone’. (Computing, 12 April 1984, p. 3).
            . And even in the late 1970s office workers had an average of only one
      tenth of the capital equipment of shop-floor workers (TUC, 1979: p. 24).

      (1970) and Argyris (1973).
            . Such a view has been argued thus:
       While there has been a tendency historically for the secretarial
       worker's job to develop as a completely manual function, many
        secretarial workers find they have auxiliary tasks to perform, such as
        filing, the responsibility for an individual’s mail and making coffee.
       The object of word-processing systems is to fragment the secretarial
       job further. High levels of efficiency and cost-effectiveness are best
       achieved by stripping away all possible distractions from the actual job
        of typing ... Proponents of word-processing argue that the new
       technology will lighten the burden of office work and free secretarial
       workers for more interesting work. Perhaps the top secretaries will be
       given a more administrative function, but the largely working-class
       women who are on the lower levels of the hierarchy will find their
       work becoming more boring, routine and intensified. (Conference of
        Socialist Economists Micro-electronics Group, 1980: pp. 48-9)
             . See McCabe and Popham (1977), Bird (1980) and West (1981).

      Green et al. (1983).
             . Aglietta describes Fordism rather indigestibly as ‘the principle of an
      articulation between process of production and mode of consumption
      which constitutes the mass production that is the specific content of the
      universalisation of wage labour’ (1979: p. 117).
     10. Aglietta lists the ‘limits to Fordism’ as applied to the mass production
       sectors thus:
       @ the synchronisation of production sequences to keep labour and
        capital working all the time; this includes such problems as the time
        taken to start up and balance the work between workers on the
        production line.

```

```
    @ the limits of speed-up imposed by the ‘nervous exhaustion’ of
     workers.
    @ the difficulties of tying individual effort levels to collective output
     within a collective means of production. As a result there are attempts
     to work collective bonus schemes, with measured day work replacing
     piecework, and to introduce ‘worker participation’ against the
     collective resistance of certain groups of workers. This was less a
     problem in post-war Europe as workers’ collective power had been
     weakened by fascism and war but as trade unions organised through
     the 1950s and 1960s, the flexibility of task allocation became more
     difficult. This was reflected in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the
     literature concerned with higher absenteesim, labour turnover, strikes
     and sabotage in Fordist industries.
     These problems facing firms in the mass production sector have not yet
    been solved, although there are a number of means being sought to solve
    them. Technological developments, in computer-aided management and
    in robotics for example, provide means of coping with synchronisation
   problems and with the resistance of organised workers by reducing their
    crucial role in the production process. Either by different forms of work
    organisation (autonomous work groups, quality circles) by political
    action (legislation restricting workers’ trade union power) or by
   economic pressure (through higher [unemployment ] [or ] [international ]
   movement of new investment) [the ] [forms ] [of ] [worker ] [veto ] [over ] [the ]
    reorganisation of production on more [profitable ] [lines ] [can ] [be ] [circum- ]
    vented. :
  fit Thus, in 1954, 60 per cent of the average British household expenditure
    on entertainment was spent on cinema, theatre, etc. admissions and 40
    per cent on the purchase and hire of televisions, radios, etc. By 1974 the
    balance had shifted, to 21 per cent and 79 per cent respectively. A similar
   change can be observed in the balance between domestic ‘help’, laundry,
    etc. and domestic appliance purchase (1954: 67 per cent to 33 per cent,
    1974: 32 per cent to 68 per cent). In transport the shift was even greater
    from services to goods (1954: 50 per cent to 50 per cent; 1974: 18 per cent
    to 82 per cent). See Gershuny (1983: p. 18).
  Le This is an effect only partly realised in practice because of the elastic
    nature of domestic labour requirements; see Huws (1982: p. 92).
  43: In Britain, such convictions have been a continual theme of the post-1979
   Conservative government, although the rhetoric has often concealed the
    practical difficulties of radical reductions in state spending; see Hall and
   Jacques (1983) and Riddell (1983).

     CONCLUSION: FROM FORDISM TO NEO-FORDISM?
              . Perez (1983) has made a similar point, although with less historical
       detail, seeing boom periods of expansion as indicative of a ‘good match’
      between new technological systems and the socio-institutional arrange-
      ments. Depressions are thus periods of mis-match between these two.
            . Such arguments have been put forward recently by Hales (1980) and by a
      number of liberal engineers; see Rosenbrock (1979), Council for Science
      and Society (1981) and Thring (1980). The engineering research that
       their ideas suggest would require more substantial state support than is at
       present forthcoming, and could be part of some ‘alternative’ research
      programme enacted by a radical government of the left. (See Group for
      Alternative Science and Technology Strategies, 1982.)
             . This of course has been the subject of much study by geographers
      seeking to describe recent locational changes in industrial production;
       see Massey and Meegan (1982) and Fothergill and Gudgin (1982). These
       locational factors — the shift of industry to the US ‘sunbelt’ or the UK M4
       corridor — have important political implications; for the UK, see Massey
       (1983) and for the USA, see Davis (1984).
            . Murray (1983), using examples from Italian industry, discusses the
       influence of new electronic-based technologies on the location of
      production units. He emphasises how managements can use such
      technologies to gain greater control over production and weaken the
       constraints placed on their prerogatives to organised workers.
              . These points are discussed further in Blackburn, Green and Liff (1982);
       for a preliminary assessment of the innovation and employment
       strategies of the Greater London Council see Elliott (1984).
