             THRE AISTORY OF THE BOOK
 Throughout human history, the world’s knowledge and fruits of the creative
 imagination have been produced, circulated and received through the medium
 of the material text. This Companion provides a wide-ranging account of the
 history of the book and its ways of thinking about works from ancient inscription
 to contemporary e-books, discussing thematic, chronological and methodologi-
 cal aspects of this interdisciplinary field. The first part considers book cultures
 from local, national and global perspectives. Part two, organized around the
 dynamic relationship between the material book and the mutable text, develops
 a loosely chronological narrative from early writing, through manuscript and
 early printing, to the institution of a mechanized book trade, and on to the
 globalization of publishing and the introduction of the electronic book. A third
 part takes a practical turn, discussing methods, sources and approaches: biblio-
 graphical, archival and reading experience methodologies, as well as pedagogical
 strategies.
 LESLIE HOWSAM is University Professor in the Department of History at the
 University of Windsor. She is author or editor of seven significant books and
 numerous articles, most notably Old Books and New Histories: An Orientation
 to Studies in Book and Print Culture (2006) and Past into Print: The Publishing of
 History in Britain 1850-1950 (2009).
     A complete list of books in the series is at the back of this book.

               LESLIE HOWSAM
     The study of book history
  The history of the book is a way of thinking about how people have given
  material form to knowledge and stories. Knowledge and stories are intangi-
   ble; it is their material forms that make them accessible across the barriers
  created by time and space. But those forms vary. It is difficult to find two old
  books that are exactly alike, while new media too are remarkably unstable in
  their ways of capturing texts. The variations among copies and editions, and
  among conventions and practices, are the result of human agency: of political
  and personal choices, of belief and aesthetics, of economics and marketing.
  Studies in the history of the book discover and analyse the connections
  between the people who used books as readers, and those who wrote or
  compiled them. These relationships are often revealed indirectly, by focusing
  upon the contribution of the mediators between reader and author. Those
  who make, sell and save books — the scribes, printers, editors, publishers
  and retailers, the librarians and collectors — are essential figures in what is
  sometimes called a book culture. Their interactions make up a web of con-
  nections, each person influenced knowingly or unknowingly by the actions of
  the others. Commerce becomes involved; so does state authority, and so
  might literary art, entertainment, scholarship, piety, polemic or instruction.
  Thinking about old books gives us access to traces of the past, and reminds us
  that new books embody concrete evidence of the practices of our own time.
   The history of the book is a field of study with extraordinary academic and
  popular energy. Many readers, aware of the changes occurring in contem-
  porary publishing and bookselling and of the digital reading experience, are
  newly intrigued by the Gutenberg moment and the ways in which print and
  writing were disseminated in earlier times. Undergraduates find book history
  an accessible introduction to literary and historical approaches to knowledge
  and culture. Scholars are discovering, or rediscovering, its specialized skills of
  paleography and bibliographical analysis. This Cambridge Companion to
  the History of the Book is addressed to general readers, to scholars seeking

                            topic,
     reading ideas. Readers will learn that the history of the book is an interdisci-
     plinary field of study. Some of the disciplines in question are: literatures
     in various languages; history and its sub-disciplines; bibliography (which
    may connect both to literatures and to rare-book librarianship); communica-
     tion studies; cultural studies; digital humanities; publishing studies; library
     and information studies. Scholarship in these fields, as in most humanities and
     social science disciplines, has been challenged to interrogate its Eurocentric
     biases and aspire to be transnational and transcultural. While this
    Companion includes extensive discussion of western literatures, historiogra-
     phies and bibliographies, the ambition has been to show the book, and people
     of the book, in global perspective. Chapters address the traditional European
     questions and methods, while demonstrating their particularity and differ-
     ence from practices that have developed in other parts of the world, and the
     chronology and glossary address key events and complexities of terminology.
                 What is the book?
     Despite its undisputed materiality, ‘the book’ is a more flexible and abstract
     conceptual category than many people imagine, and it is this very quality that
    makes it interesting. There were books before printing, and the manuscript
     practices that reproduced texts before the use of printing still flourish genera-
     tions after Gutenberg. There were scrolls before codex volumes, and the scroll
     form, too, persisted in some cultures (it has metaphorically taken on a new life
     in the way we respond to digital texts on computer screens). Before there was
     paper, there were animal skins, papyrus rolls and clay tablets, and these and
     other surfaces continue to serve as the base, or substrate, to carry texts across
     the limits of time and space. The history of the book extends beyond the
     western alphabet, to many different kinds of marks ona material base, used in
     various cultures as a means of communicating knowledge or stories. The
     book is an awkward and ambiguous term by which to convey all this
     diversity, but it is the only one we have. Most dictionary definitions of ‘the
     book’ are, moreover, unabashedly Eurocentric and modern. The Oxford
     Dictionaries Online, for example, refers to ‘a written or printed work, con-
     sisting of pages glued or sewn together along one side and bound in covers’.
     For the book historian, such a definition presents several problems. Not every
     book is a ‘work’, whether of literature or of some non-literary genre. Some of
     those pages glued or sewn together contain writing that does not fall within
     the purposeful-sounding parameters of the term, while other ‘works’ appear

   its words spoken aloud or repurposed in digital form, a book is still a book -
  but what is that?
    For the book historian, then, the dictionary definitions (which tend also to
  be the definitions commonly used in journalism and the popular culture) can
  be problematic. They refer only to the codex, a specific form of the book
  introduced in Europe in about the second century CE, which began to be
  challenged (although not defeated) in the second decade of the second millen-
  nium CE. When a text is loaded on a digital reading device, it remains a book,
  although not a codex. There were books before Gutenberg started printing
  with moveable type in central Europe — manuscript books where he lived and
  printed books in China and Korea. Since the eighteenth century, a magazine
   or journal, if not exactly a book because of its periodicity and hybridity, has
  been very much part of the book culture in which it is published. So has a
  pamphlet, a comic, a blank form or an edition of the sacred text of any one of
   the world’s religions. In ancient India, a palm leaf could carry the text of a
  poem and the same poem can be published, collected and read in print. In
   central Canada, the wampum belt used by First Nations people to commu-
   nicate memory and story was a book of sorts." In Mesopotamia, the clay
   tablets that have survived (where other more fragile forms of writing got lost)
   are books too. And so are the papyrus sheets of the Nile Valley, the sheepskin
  vellum that made sense in Europe, and the rag-based paper first used in China.
   In one sense, the mission of the history of the book is to unsettle conventional
   definitions of its very subject.
   The objective of the present volume is to help readers recognize the
  lineaments of book history. To that end, definitions in terms of research
  practice and scholarly findings may be of more utility than sketching the
  range of possible book forms and formats. In one sense, ‘the history of the
  book’ is a narrative constructed to emphasize change over historical time
  and hence an argument about the past. But the history of the book is also
  something more abstract: a way of thinking about how forces within the
  media culture of any era have acted upon the authors and compilers who
  produced the works that became books and periodicals during that era. The
  approach includes consideration of how those works were reshaped to make
  new books and periodicals for succeeding generations of readers. The
  history of the book is also a field of academic study, although it is not an
  autonomous academic discipline. It draws upon a range of literary, histor-
  ical, bibliographical and social science approaches to do its work. Although
  none of the four aspects analysed [below ] [can ] [be ] [separated ] [from ] [any ] [of ][the ]

     business of both authors and readers, and scholars have shown that the same
     text was interpreted differently by different readers. Literary criticism considers
     texts without necessarily assessing their social and economic context, but the
     history of the book makes a vital contribution to criticism. Scholars investigate
     what can be found about an author’s intentions and about how those intentions
     were thwarted — or enhanced — by the actions of those who were involved in its
     production, multiplication and preservation. Editors interpolate; typesetters
     misprint; publishers consult the bottom line; and authors respond. Charles
     Dickens, for example, was once disparaged because he wrote for money, not
     for literary art. Robert L. Patten has shown, however, that Dickens’s art was to
     create his own persona as the author, using (and modifying) the tools of the
     print culture emerging around him in early Victorian England.*
      The book is a material object. From the literary and historical perspectives,
     the materiality of books is often overlooked, so powerful are their texts and the
     impacts of those texts upon their times. But bibliographical scholarship demon-
      strates that the book-as-object holds the evidence of its own making; it carries
     not only the obvious text on its pages but a further ‘text’ in its format, materials,
     design and impression. The periodical is also an object, whose material text
     reappears, repeatedly and systematically, bearing a different written text each
     time. Such design elements are sometimes called the ‘paratext’, a useful concept
     introduced by the literary theorist Gérard Genette. Paratextual elements (bind-
     ings, blurbs, design and so forth) supplied by editors and publishers can affect
     the meaning of the text they embellish. Moreover, since books are reprinted,
     reissued, edited and excerpted, pirated or plagiarized, they also contain the
     evidence of their remaking, and point to the agents of revision. It is the
     combination of textuality and materiality, perhaps unique among human-
     made artefacts, that gives the book its power to convey a sense of its past.
     The New Zealand and Oxford scholar D. F. McKenzie showed how a play-
     wright’s typographic disposition of his plays crucially affected the way in which
     eighteenth-century readers understood them. McKenzie spoke of bibliography
      as a kind of ‘sociology of texts’ — a way to embed the study of material texts in
     the human and social contexts from which those texts emerged and within
     which they circulated.’ Bibliographical scholarship in practice is highly special-
     ized, like the knowledge of physicists. But (like the knowledge of physicists) its
     findings can be interpreted for a lay audience; and (unlike most scientific
     knowledge) bibliographical scholarship is accessible to new practitioners in
     the form of workshops and master classes.
      The book is a cultural transaction — a relationship of communication and

  writer implied in every act of reading.‘ It includes the agency of the book trades,
   a complex set of practices that can easily be overlooked because the names and
   roles of the agents have changed with shifts in materials and technologies. In
  Europe’s middle ages, for example, the key figures in book culture were
   the stationer (who controlled the trade in materials and whose shop was an
   intellectual centre) and the scribe (whose scriptorium was set up to reproduce
   texts needed by the major institution of his time, the Church). For three centuries
   after Gutenberg, that key agent was the master printer, an entrepreneur and
   intellectual as well as a craftsman. A scientific, medical or literary author who
  wanted to ensure accurate reproduction of a text was careful to work closely
  with a trustworthy printer. In Britain and early America, the term ‘bookseller’
   referred to a dominant entrepreneurial figure in the eighteenth century, but to a
   less powerful retailer later on. In the nineteenth century, when printing and
  papermaking were made cheaper and faster by new technologies, the key agent
  became the publisher; printers and booksellers were less influential, and the
  gateway was controlled by this new figure. The roles of both entrepreneurial
   publisher and retail bookseller are being challenged in the twenty-first century
  and it is unclear which agent has become the more powerful.
   Another element in the concept of the book as a cultural transaction is the
  agency of librarians and other collectors, including the power of institutions
  such as libraries and archives to shape a tradition or define a heritage. Many
  more books and periodicals were published than have survived, and survival
  has often depended upon the decision to put something in a library — and keep
   it there.
   Some scholars have adopted methodologies addressing a wide-ranging or
  ‘macro’ analysis to capture the role of books in social and cultural transac-
   tions. The Annales school of historians in mid-twentieth-century France
  introduced methodologies for tracking the numbers of titles, editions and
  copies in circulation of certain books. Aspects of this methodology for quan-
   tifying and visualizing the penetration of significant works into their cultures
  (sometimes called ‘historical bibliometrics’) have been adopted by scholars
  using database methodologies and continue to be remarkably fruitful.
   The book is an experience — the reader, the collector and the scholar, in
   their different ways, all react emotionally as well as intellectually to the books
   in their purview. Such responses are based on material and commercial
   factors as well as factors associated [with ] [content ] [and ][genre. ] [Although ] [reading ]
   is a private activity, leaving [little ] [trace ] [on ] [the ][historical ] [record, ] [its ][importance ]

    book and more generally the copying practice as ‘commonplacing’.
     H. J. Jackson has demonstrated how scholars can use the notes made by
     readers who used the margins of a book to converse with the author and (as it
     happens) with posterity.° To collect books can be a passion. Collectors range
     from the wealthy investor in incunables or first editions, to the Book-of-the-
    Month-Club member, to the adolescent ‘book geek’ who is keen to gather a
     full set of graphic novels. What collectors have in common is a response to
    books as books, with all their materiality, multiplicity and variability. They
     are moved by the replication of some specific, idiosyncratic amalgamation of
     text and object and respond by seeking to possess a complete set. Some
     aspects of the scholarship in the history of the book attempt to capture this
     elusive phenomenon, recognizing that intangible emotional responses may be
     part of the reason why the book form has survived for millennia as a medium
     of communication. And some of the new scholarship in the history of the
    emotions has used as evidence the sentimentality of literary genres arising in
     the eighteenth century.°
      That the history of the book draws upon all four of these approaches may
     go some way to explain how difficult it has been clearly to define ‘the book’ in
     a few words. But people who think in terms of book history share two key
     principles: the book is mutable (both text and material format keep changing,
     and much of our scholarship serves to document those changes); and the book
     is the product of human agency (despite the importance of technological
     innovations and impersonal forces, what we are interested in is the way
    human beings have used those innovations and responded to those forces).
              What is the history of the book?
    The opening paragraph of this chapter defined the history of the book as ‘a
    way of thinking about how people have given material form to knowledge
    and stories’ in the past and in our own time. At least five aspects of this way of
     thinking can be identified, and serve to illustrate what these words really
    mean in everyday practice.
                  Chronology
    The most conventional and straightforward approach to the history of the
     book might be to start at the beginning, continue to present time, and then
     stop — on either an up beat or a down beat according to one’s level of optimism
     about the future. In Europe-based scholarship, that chronology most often

  century CE. Rather than unrolling a papyrus scroll, readers turned a parchment
   or paper page, and scribes began to leave spaces between the words. Scholars
  of premodern Europe regard this turning point as even more significant than
  the next one, from manuscript codex to printed codex, about 1450 in Mainz,
  Germany, personified in the compelling figure of Johannes Gutenberg.” For the
  next three and a half centuries, printing and publishing were adopted enthu-
   siastically throughout Europe and the world, but with virtually no change
   to the mechanism of the hand press. That technology was robust enough
  to support ‘the birth of the novel’ in eighteenth-century Europe as well as a
  vast Output of newspapers and other periodicals. A further transformation
  occurred in the first half of the nineteenth century, beginning in Britain,
  where printing and related trades became industrialized — paper was cheaper,
  and machine-made; bookbinding was mechanized; steam power was applied to
  the press, and publishers made use of steam-powered shipping by rail and sea to
  distribute their products worldwide.® Further technological innovations were
  introduced throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, most
  notably linotype and photocomposition. In the mid-twentieth-century decades
  the innovations applied to marketing, when paperback binding and mail-order
  book clubs acted to further commodify books that were aimed at a new
  ‘middlebrow’ readership.’ In the first two decades of the twenty-first century,
   it is the e-book that seems to be a significantly different way of delivering words
  on the page. The page, however, remains virtually the same as it has been since
  the codex was introduced a millennium ago.
   Whether oriented to substrates, materials or genres, these compelling and
  coherent (though oversimplified) chronologies highlight similarities as well as
  differences. But they are all Eurocentric. They do not allow for the history of the
  book in Asia, where pictographic writing systems have meant different devel-
  opments in relation to printing and to genre. Nor do they apply to any situation
  where scholars want to take into account the writing or notation systems used
  by indigenous peoples.*° And there is an inherent problem in the teleological
  notion of progress, which might seem to imply that something called ‘the book’
  has ‘evolved’ from a primitive to a more sophisticated way of preserving knowl-
  edge and stories. Fortunately, the study of the history and culture of books
  complicates this sort of developmental paradigm, because it embeds changes in
  book form, technology and practice in the cultures where they were used.
       A circuit of composition, mediation and production
  Perhaps the most influential piece of writing in the study of book history is a

```

-----

```
    ‘communication circuit’. Impressed by the range of methodologies for
    approaching book history, but troubled by the tendency of interdisciplinarity
     to ‘run riot’, Darnton offered a tentative model. It showed the book moving
    around on an oval track from author, to publisher, to printer, then on to the
     shipper, then the bookseller (both wholesale and retail) and on to the reader.
    The reader, he argued, ‘completes the circuit’ because the writer is also a
     reader. It was a compelling way to capture the complexity of a book’s
     trajectory through space and time, and to demonstrate the influence of the
    book trades on the way in which readers interpret the work of authors.
     Darnton’s own research has focused on eighteenth-century France, and the
     circuit he drew reflected that time and place, but the circuit can be modified to
     illustrate the processes in use elsewhere. **
     A number of scholars have critiqued Darnton’s circuit diagram, recogniz-
     ing that it still captures only a narrow slice of the life of a book. It fails, for
     example, to demonstrate the movement of a single text through decades and
     centuries, and among various textual and material forms. There is no way to
    show the interplay in a literary culture, between purists and profiteers,
     perhaps characterized in gender terms as men of letters and women who are
     mere ‘scribblers’. Scholars who focus primarily on the book as a material
     object have criticized the abstract nature of the ‘book’ characterized by
     Darnton, substituting a ‘map’ that identified the five events in the life of a
     material book — publishing, manufacturing, distribution, reception and sur-
     vival. Darnton himself, in a 2007 article, recognized this shortcoming, and
     also admitted that he hadn’t left a space for the survival of the book as an
     object, collected and collectible, enduring in libraries.** But the strength of the
     original model remains its emphasis on human agency in the making and use
     of books, and its potential for showing the relationships between those two
     functions.
         Disciplinary boundaries and interdisciplinary opportunities
    Another way of characterizing the history of the book is by identifying the
     intellectual formation of the people who research and write about it. Many
     scholars in this field can be located in one of three disciplines and related
     perspectives. As delineated above, but now from the perspective of disci-
     plines: bibliographers look at the book primarily as an object; literary scho-
     lars think of it in terms of text; while historians conceptualize the book as a
     cultural transaction. It can be difficult to integrate the circuit of authorship,
     publishing and reading with the three core disciplines, since each process can

```

-----

```
  The bibliographical object and the literary text are two sides of the same
  coin, and when the book is conceptualized as is a transaction, the biblio-coin
  becomes a currency, used for exchange.*? Every scholar whose work includes
  book history uses all three of these approaches, but the set of assumptions
  drawn from each person’s core discipline is likely to dominate.
   The contemporary culture of the book, however, is not the purview of those
  disciplines looking into the distant, or even the recent, past. Plenty of people
  want to know more about the authorship, publishing and reading of the
  books we read today. Certainly the insights of book history are relevant to
  the study of contemporary publishing, where the mutability of texts in con-
  temporary society, and global media, is a dominant theme. The marketing of
  a phenomenon like J. K. Rowling’s Harry Potter books is a case in point: a
  biographical narrative of the author made her an attractive figure; titles and
  stories were widely known to have been revised for a transatlantic audience;
  and the popularity of the series became inextricable for a time from peda-
  gogical and parenting discourse about boys as readers. The disciplines look-
  ing at contemporary culture and communications have found the interplay of
  production and reception inherent in book history useful for studying such
  phenomena as the adaptation industry, and transmedial authorship.**
              Categories, genres, formats
  Another useful way to structure the history of the book is to think in terms of
  how works are categorized — by the trade, by librarians and by scholars. Such
  designations affect the way books are written, made public, received and
  preserved. From a literary perspective, the term ‘genre’ addresses some, but
  not all, of the variables. The original, classical, genres are poetry, drama and
  prose (the latter subdivided into numerous sub-genres). In the contemporary
  publishing business, however, ‘genre’ has become a term for categorizing
  books for the purposes of marketing. ‘Genre fiction’, for example, differenti-
  ates mystery, sci-fi, romance, fantasy and horror, while ‘self help’ and ‘bio-
  graphy’ are two of several forms of ‘non-fiction’. For book historians,
  however, it is often more interesting to work with subject categories, looser
  groupings such as literature, science, history, philosophy etc. These sub-
  divisions might perhaps be characterized as genres of the material book.
  The disciplinary proclivities of people who embrace the history of the book
  are often reflected in the categories of the books on which they work. In

     scientific books and periodicals, by historians of science; a handful of studies,
    by historians, discuss the publishing history of history books, but few scholars
    have focused as yet on philosophy or mathematics as book-historical
    categories. Another category, again sometimes called a genre, is the material
    format in which a text appears. Such labels may relate to the anticipated
    readership or target market of the book: some of the distinctions include
    hardcover (versus paperback) edition; trade (as opposed to mass-market)
    paperback; comic book (versus graphic novel); various kinds of periodical
     (as opposed to monographs); and manuscript book (versus print-book or
    e-book). Scholarship in the history of the book is attentive to the ways in
    which historical actors, both producers and consumers, thought in their time
    about how books were categorized.
             National and transnational approaches
    To scholars oriented to national canons of literature in particular languages,
    and to national historical narratives, it has been of compelling interest to
    study the history of the book from the perspective of one country. Following
     the lead of the history of publishing in France appearing in 1986, national
     libraries, major publishers and prominent scholars initiated ambitious pro-
     jects to chart the trajectories of the book in Britain, the US, Ireland, Scotland,
    Canada and Australia, to name a few. In most cases, a combination of
    chronological and thematic approaches was adopted, and strenuous efforts
    were made to fill lacunae in the research record. The bibliographical record
    associated with each national library was a key source document, as were the
    archives of publishers and the records left by authors and readers, libraries
    and booksellers. The similarities revealed by this new canon of book histor-
    iography are striking; but the differences are more interesting. The practices
    of composing, making, distributing and reading books have differed from one
    place to another and those variations derive from differences of geography,
    population and economy. Still, the national approach forced researchers to
    ask a new question. In an industry where the raw materials, the producers, the
    products and the customers all routinely cross national boundaries con-
     stantly, why should ‘nation’ be the paradigm in any case? Transnational
    and postcolonial approaches began to yield rich results, such as Isabel
    Hofmeyr’s study of how that quintessentially English book, Bunyan’s
    Pilgrim’s Progress, attained its status in England as a result of how it was
    read and used in Africa. It became apparent that the nation state approach is
     also about theory, a theory of nationalism. Many scholars, both within and
    outside the history of the book world, have been strongly influenced by

  whereby they define themselves in national terms because they think of
  themselves as reading the same novel, or the same newspaper, as someone
  else in the same town, or the same country. Now the book history approach is
  being used to critique Anderson’s compelling ideas.
   The chapters that follow have been commissioned to showcase the history
  of the book in the way that scholars have come to understand the subject in
  the twenty-first century. Part I considers book cultures from the local,
  national and global perspectives, beginning with books in the library, where
  collections and individual volumes are preserved, catalogued and made
  accessible (Chapter 2 by Karen Attar). At the level of countries, the historio-
  graphies of printing, of the nation state and of modernity itself have become
  fused in a compelling but problematic narrative that has become book his-
  tory’s task to rewrite (Chapter 3 by Trish Loughran). Moving out to the
  transnational level that transcends nation and yet embraces locality, a focus
  upon the book’s habit of travelling across the boundaries of time and space
  (undergoing transformation as it goes) has been captured in a challenging
  new model of ‘situated knowledges’ (Chapter 4 by Sydney Shep).
   Part II is roughly chronological, with its seven chapters organized around
  the dynamic relationship between the material book and the mutable text.
  The first fundamental question concerns the way in which the surfaces (or
  substrates) upon which text is preserved — and the formats in which such
  materials are arranged — have worked over the centuries to convey meaning
  (Chapter 5 by Peter Stoicheff). Next comes handwriting, which in relation to
  the history of the book includes the persistence of manuscript as an
  effective medium of publication, not only in the European context before
  Gutenberg but in certain cultures long afterwards, indeed until the present
  day (Chapter 6 by Margaret Ezell). The coming of print to Europe appears
  midway through the volume, and the remarkable experiments made by
  Gutenberg are balanced against the equally important narrative of the
  means by which his contemporaries came to terms with the new technology
  (Chapter 7 by Adrian Johns). The following chapter lingers in the early-
  modern period to emphasize the dual character of the new ‘print culture’ in
  early-modern Europe, where the new medium undeniably exercised institu-
  tional authority but at the same time enabled subversive ideas (Chapter 8 by
  Cyndia Clegg). The industrial revolution of the book incorporated not only
  the new technologies that appeared in the nineteenth century, but also the
  new management processes that began to be established during the eighteenth
  century (Chapter 9 by James Raven). [The ] [book ] [in ][the ] [long ][twentieth ] [century ]

    bringing the study of the book up to present-day concerns, the scholarship of
    book history, working in collaboration with that of digital humanities, 1s
    helping us to understand the e-book (Chapter 11 by Jon Bath and Scott
    Schofield).
     The study of book history is full of promise and excitement, but it is also
    rigorous and exacting, because much of the scholarship is based on the
    interpretation of empirical evidence. Part II is concerned with methods,
    sources and approaches to book history. The chapter on book history from
    descriptive bibliographies introduces a highly technical field of study from the
    perspective of the user, in order to help students of book history to interpret
    these useful (but often challenging) resources (Chapter 12 by Michael
    Suarez). Bibliographical analysis is crucially important because, often, the
    book itself contains all the evidence that survives about its own making. The
    essay on book history from the archival record, however, offers practical
    advice to the researcher who has either author—publisher correspondence or
    book-trade statistics to deal with (Chapter 13 by Katherine Bode and Roger
    Osborne). If it seems difficult to find evidence for the idiosyncrasies of
    printers, or of the motives of publishers, how much harder must it be to
    discover the responses of readers? Researchers have learned how to read the
    margins, as well as engaging with other evidence of the reading experience
    (Chapter 14 by Mary Hammond). And because none of this rich scholarship
     will survive unless it is conveyed to the next generation in a meaningful and
    attractive way, the final chapter examines the question of teaching and
    learning the history of the book (Chapter 15 by Leslie Howsam).
     The book you are reading has a history, too, commissioned as it was as part
    of the reputable and popular series of Cambridge Companions. That commis-
    sion, and the investment behind it, itself indicates the significance of this field
    of study in the second decade of the twenty-first century. It is the editor’s book
     as well as the publisher’s — another authority in the field might have designed a
    very different plan for a volume on the same subject. Each chapter was
    instigated by an invitation to contribute to the editor’s larger design, and
    shaped by the publisher’s guidelines, but at the same time each speaks with the
    contributor’s individual voice. The Cambridge Companion does not claim to
    be exhaustive, or to offer the final word on the subject. Rather, it seeks to
    engage vigorously in the conversation that is the history of the book.

      Books in the library
 Books in a library differ fundamentally from books anywhere else in that each
  one is part of a collection, an aggregation that imposes its own meaning derived
 from the decisions and accidents that went into its formation. Administration is
  an essential part of the difference, as librarians acquire, describe and arrange
 books, and make them available to multiple users. Still more crucial is the
  survival and transmission of knowledge which can extend far beyond the life of
  the individual library; when this knowledge is lost, the sense of cultural devas-
  tation is palpable. This chapter explores some aspects of these institutions, from
 the ancient world to the present day. It is based primarily on western (especially
  British) libraries, with particular emphasis on national and large academic
  libraries. These are the repositories with the largest numbers of books and the
 greatest responsibility for preservation. While technological progress renders a
 certain focus on the modern period inevitable, an historical perspective reveals
 that the basic principles of collection, preservation and the provision of access
 have transcended time and space.
                  Storage
 The earliest libraries consisted of clay tablets kept on shelves, sometimes in
 receptacles (as in jars in Ashurbanipal’s library in Nineveh in the seventh
 century BCE). The papyrus rolls forming the books in ancient Egyptian
 libraries were kept on open shelves or in pigeonholes in storage areas. The
 Romans introduced the armarium (‘chest’) as a receptacle for books used
 well into the Middle Ages. These were cupboards divided vertically and
 horizontally to house rolls, or by horizontal shelves only for codices, the
 norm from the fourth century CE. Books lay on their sides. With the increase
 in the size of libraries in the fourteenth or fifteenth century, sometimes from
 a few hundred to a few thousand books — a process encouraged by the
 advent of printing in the 1450s — armaria gave way to library rooms; some

         Cathedrals. standard late medieval ecclesiastical
      library, intended for books and readers, was rectangular, three or four times
     longer than it was wide, with high ceilings and large, high windows to
     maximise natural light, and stone walls, floor and ceiling to protect against
      fire. Libraries were on upper floors to protect against damp and floods.
     Books were kept on lecterns, or sloping desks, on spaces between the win-
     dows, perpendicular to the side walls, on either side of a central aisle. Some
      lecterns had a shelf approximately nine inches below the desk and/or a
     narrow shelf at the top to accommodate books. In some places such as
     Cambridge and Leiden, and generally in France, readers stood to read; else-
     where (notably Zutphen in the Netherlands) they sat on benches, with one or
     two benches between each pair of desks. Books were chained, attached to a
     bar at the top of the desk, and were kept facing outwards. Following the
      lectern system came the stall system, similar except that books were kept on
      short double-faced bookcases above the desktop (which might be hinged),
     with books beneath and benches at which to sit between.
      The ‘wall system’ of bookcases against walls, allowing more storage, began
      at the Escorial Library in Spain (completed in 1584) and was soon adopted
     throughout Europe; in England, the eastern wing of Oxford’s Bodleian
     Library (completed 1612) was an early example. Unchaining in Britain and
     concomitant storage of books with their spines outwards occurred largely by
      the second half of the eighteenth century. Some books still show how they
     were stored by signs of chaining where a staple was removed or by a title
     written on the fore-edge.
                  Selection and acquisition
     The kinds of books in libraries vary according to aspiration and purpose. The
      desire to collect comprehensively dates back millennia. Ashurbanipal in
     ancient Mesopotamia, the Ptolemies at the Alexandrian Library (fl. c. 300
     BCE-c. CE 270), the royal library in Cordoba in Muslim Spain (founded in
     approximately CE 850), Pope Nicholas V, founder of the Vatican Library,
     Charlemagne at Aachen and Sir Thomas Bodley in Oxford, all sent emissaries
     across Europe or (for the ancient libraries) the known world in quest of texts.
     Medieval monasteries contained primarily religious works, with the emphasis
     depending on the order (for example, church fathers and Franciscan com-
     mentaries in Franciscan libraries; sermons, canon law and rhetoric in libraries
     of the mendicant orders), and some practical ones (medicine, agriculture and
      so forth) required for the everyday administration of the monastery. Medieval

 Since the Middle Ages, school and parish libraries have existed, as have
 professional and special libraries — for law, for medicine, for heraldry — to
 serve specific groups. Fee-paying subscription and circulating libraries origi-
 nated in the eighteenth century. Commercial circulating libraries dealt chiefly
 in fiction (and were sometimes reviled for their demoralizing influence);
 subscription libraries were more serious, with titles in politics, religion,
 natural sciences and philosophy. Later, municipal libraries stocked both
 fiction and non-fiction, with frequent tension between the demands of educa-
 tion and entertainment. Some countries developed libraries to serve ideologi-
 cal purposes: Russian public libraries in the twentieth century were intended
 to inculcate the ideals of Communism, and German public ones during the
 Third Reich to further National Socialist views.
  Books in libraries have not always been those that were wanted. Much
 acquisition in the manuscript period was by copying, which implies choice,
 and, much later, members of subscription libraries pooled resources to select
 what they wanted to buy. But most libraries were largely donation-driven
 until well into the nineteenth century; the university library at Gottingen in
 the eighteenth century was exceptional precisely for its purchasing capacity,
 with an acquisitions budget of 400 Taler a year from its foundation in 1737.
 Victorian British public libraries were as badly placed in this respect as
 academic libraries on both sides of the Atlantic, as the acquisition and upkeep
 of buildings devoured the available funds. Bequests were likely to be a gen-
 eration behind scholarship.
  Single major gifts or purchases frequently created or transformed impor-
 tant libraries: the Bibliothéque Mazarine in Paris, based on the personal
 collection of Cardinal Mazarin; the Biblioteca Marciana in Venice, based
 on the founding collection of Cardinal Bessarion; the Staatsbibliothek zu
 Berlin (State Library of Berlin), from the library of Frederick William, Great
 Elector of Brandenburg; the Sloane, Harley, Cotton and Royal collections at
 the British Library; the personal library of Thomas Jefferson at the Library of
 Congress, to name just a few. Early public libraries absorbed the entire
 holdings of mechanics’ institute libraries.
  The significance of books in libraries changes over time, as the content moves
 from up-to-date knowledge about a subject to sources for the history of that
 subject. Books now valued as history were once discarded as merely out-of-
 date. Manuscripts which were once carriers of knowledge are now preserved in
 libraries as artefacts and are studied for their paleographical, codicological, art
 historical or transmission value. [Incunabula, ] [also ] [originally ] [carriers ] [of ][know!l- ]

      sive purchasing in the nineteenth century. German National Socialist textbooks
     acquired for doctrinal purposes have now become historical witnesses to the
     Third Reich and warnings to future generations.
                        Access
     The book in the library is a shared resource, open to members of a particular
     geographical area from parish to national level, professional or religious group,
      educational establishment, or other community or (for subscription libraries)
      those able and willing to pay. Access has never meant unrestricted or unlimited
      access. Lack of full-time library staff and reliance on natural light (for the
      centuries when artificial light depended on flame and was a fire hazard) com-
      bined to limit opening hours to only a few hours a day or even week. As an
     extreme instance, rules for Harvard (America’s largest college library during the
      colonial period) from 1769 decreed that the library was to be open 9.00-11.00
      on Fridays, with students entering singly. Commercial circulating libraries in
      Britain, on the other hand, opened for up to twelve hours a day, precisely
      because they were business ventures and the books commodities. By the end of
      the nineteenth century, most American college libraries (but not European
      university ones) were open for six or seven days a week from morning to
      night. Evening opening access was essential in taxpayer-supported public
      libraries, whose working-class clientele could not visit otherwise. Moreover,
     numerous libraries from antiquity onwards have been, at least in part, reference
      rather than circulating collections. Loan conditions have not been generous, as
     when medieval English Benedictine monks, in accordance with decrees handed
     down by Archbishop Lanfranc around 1070, borrowed a single book for a year
      at a time, exchanging books formally on a designated day. Political factors have
     hindered access and research, as when the progress of the Gesamtkatalog der
     Wiegendrucke, based in East Berlin, was crippled between 1940 and 1972
     through world war and the Iron Curtain. The e-book has revolutionized access
     by enabling multiple simultaneous use of a single volume.
       Sharing resources extends beyond single loans. The monastery at Fulda,
     founded in CE 744, lent numerous manuscripts to monasteries in France and
     Germany. An official system of interlibrary loan existed in the US and Canada
     from 1876, Italy from 1879, Prussia from 1893 and internationally from 1937.
     Linked with interlibrary loan is cooperative acquisition, whereby libraries
     maximize resources by a group of libraries deciding that each will specialize
      in certain areas and borrow from the others. Mass digitization projects of
      library holdings are a significant way of sharing books and knowledge of book

  and its continuation to 1800, Eighteenth-Century Collections Online (ECCO,
  2003), both subscription databases based on the holdings of multiple libraries;
  mass digitization projects agreed between Google, Inc. and major American
  and British libraries; and the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek’s undertaking to
  digitize all its incunabula, the world’s largest collection of fifteenth-century
  books in terms of copies. Apart from the obvious benefit of providing access
  to numerous early texts and their layout, such databases enable comparison
  between a copy in hand and the digitized one, thereby exposing variations in
  early printing. They do not replace actual books because they cannot reproduce
  physical features such as watermarks, and do not always reproduce features
  they could, such as preliminary leaves showing evidence of provenance.
  Moreover, images are of one copy only: other copies may vary in elements
  ranging from mispagination or ornaments to the replacement of text, as when a
  description of scriveners being ‘so rude, grosse, clownish, ignorant, that you
  would wonder’, and one in particular being a ‘rich vilaine, without learning,
  ciuilitie, humanitie & courtesie, whose face sheweth that he is always shiting’
  (copy at Senate House Library, University of London) turns with the substitu-
  tion of a gathering to a commendation of M. X., ‘a verie skilfull man in his
  trade’ (the Harvard copy, reproduced by EEBO).”
   An implication of books as a shared resource is a long-standing need to
  ensure socially acceptable treatment through rules and curses against theft,
  mutilation or the over-long retention of books. As long ago as 668-627 BCE,
  tablets in Ashurbanipal’s library bore threats such as: ‘Whoever removes [this
  tablet ...], may Ashur and Ninlil, angered and grim, cast him down, erase his
  name, his seed, in the land’.* Library rules attached to front pastedowns may
  testify to a book’s past. Marks of institutional ownership are a security measure
  helpful in tracing provenance, from the manuscript ‘ex dono’ or ‘ex libris’ to
  bookplates, known from late-fifteenth-century Germany, and blind and ink
  stamps. Further sophistication may apply: the colour of British Museum stamps
  indicated whether a book was acquired by legal deposit (blue), gift (mostly
  brown or yellow) or purchase (red or black, depending on the year).
                Cataloguing
 A large collection of books requires a key to what is there and where.

     tablet missing’. Medieval catalogues were essentially similar, starting as brief
      lists of titles arranged by subject, author or donor. The late-twelfth-century
     catalogue of Christ Church, Canterbury, was the first to include location
     symbols. Thirteenth- and fourteenth-century catalogues recorded the opening
     words (incipits). Following a practice employed at Dover (1389) and Durham
     (1391), it soon became common for medieval catalogues to record the open-
     ing words on the second leaf of a manuscript (‘secundo folio’), to identify a
     book if the first leaf had been lost, and to differentiate between different
     copies of the same text. Physical features, such as decoration, were sometimes
     also recorded to assist identification. A subject arrangement predominated.
     Catalogues of printed books were short-title catalogues, stating the author,
      title, edition, place and date of publication and format. Short-title catalogues
     arranged by subject or author, depending on preference, remained the norm
      until the end of the nineteenth century.
      The French government issued the first national set of cataloguing rules
      in 1791. The British Museum Cataloguing rules devised by Anthony Panizzi
     (1841), Charles Ammi Cutter’s Rules for a Dictionary Catalog in the US
     (1876) and the Preussische Instruktionen in Germany (1899) followed and
     helped to standardize descriptions between libraries, especially when instruc-
     tions intended for one library were adopted by others. Globalization began
     with the issue of the first edition of the Anglo-American Rules in 1908, and
     leaped forward with Paris Principles of 1961 and the International Standard
     Bibliographic Description (ISBD), the first volume of which, for monographs,
     appeared in 1971. ISBD was the standard behind the various national catalo-
     guing codes. It introduced international library punctuation, such as a colon
     between the place of publication and the name of the publisher in the imprint,
      so that users could discern the elements making up a book description with-
     out comprehending a particular language.
      Catalogues were normally printed until the late nineteenth century,
     when, except for catalogues of manuscripts, the guard-book catalogue, sheaf
     catalogue and ultimately the card catalogue took over. The printed catalogue
     became a more specialist feature for subsets of library collections such as
     books of a certain age or printed in a certain country, like the series of short-
      title catalogues for books of various European countries printed to 1600 in
     the British Library, books acquired by a particular collector or books on a
     certain subject. The later-nineteenth-century dictionary catalogue merged sub-
      ject and author into a single sequence. Automation from the late 1960s led to
     online public access catalogues (OPACs) from the 1980s which rendered
     arrangement redundant, as searching could be by multiple index points —

                    - or keyword. Moreover, the computer screen
  ended the restriction for descriptions to fit on to a card typically measuring three
 by five inches and thus allowed for much more detail. Inevitably much of this
  detail pertained to the history even of machine-press books, such as when the
  previous edition appeared, and whether the book was a translation.
   In the 1990s a drive began in Anglo-American libraries to emphasize copy-
  specific features of older books, such as provenance, bindings and annota-
  tions. The new practice was clear in the level of copy-specific detail both
  in printed catalogues such as the three-volume Catalogue of Scandinavian
 Books in the British Library Printed before 1801 (2007) and Lotte Hellinga’s
  Catalogue of Books Printed in the X Vth Century Now in the British Library.
 BMC Part XI: England (2006), and especially electronically. It transformed
  the function of the library catalogue. Hitherto the functions of a library
  catalogue had been those defined by the Harvard librarian Charles Ammi
  Cutter in 1876: to enable a user to find a known item, or to see what was
  in a library in what edition by a given author or on a given topic. Now
  the provision of extra details, combined with sophisticated electronic search
 methods, enabled the library catalogue itself to be used as a research tool. For
  example, the indexing of former owners enabled the reconstitution of dis-
  persed libraries. It also made possible analyses of a particular owner’s books
 by subject, date, author or even (depending on the level of copy-specific detail
  supplied in the catalogue and the application of vocabulary control) by
 how many of his books he annotated. Provided that libraries had entered
  the information, readers could furthermore locate publishers’ advertisements
 and ascertain such things as what books had been given as Victorian school
  prizes, or how different copies of the Eikon Basilike were bound as an
  indication of how owners regarded them. The mere availability of online
  records revealed knowledge hitherto buried in printed or card catalogues
 about the history of books, particularly with respect to dating: for
 example, we can date Pablo de Santa Maria’s Scrutinium Scriptarium (ISTC
 ipoo2z01000) to ‘not after 1470’ on the basis of a rubricator’s date on the copy
  held by Eichstatt University Library.
   The concept of shared cataloguing emerged in the seventeenth century,
 when interleaved copies of the 1674 Bodleian Library catalogue were printed
  as a starting point for custodians of other libraries to create their own by
 annotating what they had and adding books held which were not in the
 Bodleian. Implicit was a notion of excellence and comprehensiveness against
 which other libraries could match [themselves. ] [In ] [r901 ] [the ] [Library ] [of ]
 Congress in Washington, by [then ] [America’s ] [legal ] [deposit ] [library, ] [began ] [to ]
  sell cards of its holdings to other [libraries ] [in ][a ] [large-scale ] [effort ] [of ][cooperative ]

            of the cataloguing format
      in 1967-8, a division of the elements of book description into fields and sub-
      fields that enabled international sharing of catalogue records, revolutionized
     cooperative cataloguing. The introduction of the world wide web was a
     further revolution, and OPACs are now the norm.
      Realization that it was useful to have an overview of the contents of several
      libraries together came by the thirteenth century, when the Cistercian abbey
     of Savigny listed the holdings of four other libraries in Normandy as well
      as its own. A particularly ambitious medieval union catalogue is the early-
     fourteenth-century Registrum Librorum Angliae, a list by Oxford Franciscans
     of the holdings of ninety monasteries in England, Scotland and Wales; John
     Boston of Bury added twenty new libraries in the early fifteenth century. Only
      in the twentieth century did printed catalogues (now also available online)
     attempt this again — the Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke, begun in 1904; A
     Short-Title Catalogue of Books Printed in England, Scotland, and Ireland and
     of English Books Printed Abroad, 1475-1640 by Alfred Pollard and G. R.
     Redgrave (first edition 1926), based on the holdings of four main libraries, but
     with additions from nearly 150 more; and later the Verzeichnis der im
     Deutschen Sprachbereich erschienenen Drucke des 16. Jahrhunderts, started
      in 1969 and taking the holdings of 152 libraries in eight countries into account.
     The advent of computerized cataloguing facilitated union catalogues: Copac in
     the UK, launched in 1996; the Catalogue Collectif de France (1997); the Online
     Computer Library Center (OCLC)’s WorldCat (1971); and the Research
     Libraries Information Network (RLIN, founded in 1980 and merged in 2006
     with WorldCat) in the US. An outstanding example is Germany’s Karlsruher
     Virtueller Katalog (1996), which in addition to allowing a search across
      libraries in German-speaking countries provides a portal for the union cata-
     logues of other countries. In the most global manifestation of the union cata-
     logue, books in libraries merge to form international bibliographies, such as the
     Incunabula Short Title Catalogue (ISTC, istc.bl.uk) begun in 1980 and the
     English Short-Title Catalogue (ESTC, estc.bl.uk) of books printed either in
     the English language or in English-speaking countries to 1800, begun as the
     Eighteenth-Century Short-Title Catalogue in 1976 and extended in 1987 to
     include earlier books.
      Yet in addition to divulging the history of books, in some ways libraries
     obscure it. Catalogues invariably include a degree of librarianly interpretation,
     old printed ones by paucity of detail, newer ones by certain rules. Unlike
     bibliographies, library catalogues make no attempt to reproduce the appear-
     ance of a title page. Although specific rules for early printed books dictate
     accounting every page volume, more general codes ignore unnumbered

```

```
  date of publication in arabic numerals, whether or not it was in roman numerals
  on a title page; ISTC similarly interprets dates by standardizing those expressed
  in the publication in terms of a saint’s day. Most rules provide for omitting the
  names of publishers after the first or third in a publishing syndicate, for omitting
  publishers’ addresses given in imprints and for omitting the qualifications or
  other information about an author given on a title page. Libraries do not
  necessarily indicate when their copy of a title is a reprint, although reprints
  enhance our knowledge of book history, indicating popularity and sometimes
  evincing non-textual changes such as a price increase or new dustwrapper
  design. Catalogues are liable to confuse authors with identical names living
  at the same time, such as Edward Edwards, the pioneer of English public
  libraries (1812-86) and his contemporary Edward Edwards, a compositor.
  Retrospective cataloguing, namely the keying in of catalogue records or copy-
  ing of other electronic catalogue records from sketchy card descriptions, can
  result in the wrong book appearing on the catalogue, especially in the case of
  variant editions. Copy-cataloguing perpetuates mistakes, as one library un-
  critically adopts erroneous records produced by another.
   Libraries can obscure the history of books in other ways, such as by
  removing dustwrappers (which can contain advertisements and information
  not recorded elsewhere in the publication), rebinding books or pasting book-
  plates over indications of previous ownership. Private collections have been
  dispersed when entering institutional libraries. The books in libraries are not
  always the books as they entered libraries: institutional owners follow the
  practices of private owners in binding discrete items together for convenience,
  and composite volumes have been broken up, for example, to separate manu-
  scripts from printed texts.
                  Classification
  Like cataloguing, library classification has been practised, albeit crudely,
  since ancient times. Ashurbanipal (r. 668-627 BCE) is known to have kept
  a different subject in each room of his library. Roman libraries divided their
  stock into two sections by language, Latin and Greek. In the Middle Ages,
  books were classified broadly by subject, sometimes including those of the
  medieval university curriculum, the trivium (grammar, logic, rhetoric) and
  quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, [music, ] [astronomy). ] [This ] [could ] [be ][in ][sim- ]
  plified form: when the Bodleian [Library ] [opened ] [in ] [1602, ] [it ][did ][so ] [with ] [books ]
  in four categories — theology, [law, ][medicine ] [and ] [arts ] [— ] [divided ] [by ][size. ] [Within ]

```
                                        lettered,
    with subjects grouped together under a particular letter, and books were
    assigned numbers according to their position on the shelf: for example,
    H.2.4 indicated the fourth book on the second shelf of bookcase H. Such
    shelfmarks can still be found in parts, at least, of some major libraries,
    perhaps most famously among the Cottonian manuscripts in the British
     Library, where each bookcase was known by the bust of the Roman emperor
    which adorned it, such that the Beowulf manuscript, for example, has the
    shelfmark Cotton Vitellius A.xv. When they can be traced to particular
     libraries, old shelfmarks are a valuable element of provenance research.
      Classification as we know it, whereby broad subject areas are divided and
    subdivided and books are assigned codes which describe their relationship to
    each other rather than a fixed point on a shelf, began in the third quarter of
     the nineteenth century. It became prevalent in conjunction with the increase
     of open access to shelves in public libraries from the 1890s to facilitate
     subject browsing. (Previously readers had selected books from catalogues.)
    The first classification system to be published was the Dewey Decimal
     Classification, devised by the American Melvil Dewey for the library at
    Amherst, Massachusetts, which appeared in forty-two pages (twelve each
     of introductory material and tables and an eighteen-page index) in 1876. It
    was a numerical system which divided knowledge into ten broad classes,
    broken down further by tens: for example, 000 ‘Computer science, informa-
     tion and general works’; o90 ‘Manuscripts and rare books’; 092 ‘block
     books’. Dewey’s system rapidly became popular. A second edition, expanded
     to 486 pages, was published in 1885; the twenty-third edition was published
     in four volumes in 2011. Classification helped to internationalize books in
     libraries: whereas with a shelfmark system the notation for a particular book
    would be unique to the holding library, a book classified by a particular
    scheme would theoretically have the same classmark (or call number) as the
    same book classified by that scheme anywhere else in the world. By
     1927, when a Survey of the Libraries of the United States was published,
    Dewey’s system was employed in 96 per cent of American public libraries
    and 89 per cent of college and university ones. The system reached the UK
    by 1878, when it was adopted by the National Library of Ireland and, by
     the time of the 1927 survey, was thought to be used in more than five
    hundred libraries in England. Today it is the most prevalent system in the
     world, used in more than 200,000 libraries in 135 countries. The Universal
    Decimal System, developed in Belgium, first published in r904-7, and used
     in some 125 countries, derives from it. The Library of Congress developed an
    in-house alphanumeric system of classification with twenty-one main classes

      First in Britain the National Library of Wales in 1913, it, too,
  is now used worldwide, especially in national and academic libraries. Smaller
  classification schemes have distinguished books nationally. Two faceted
  classification schemes, S. R. Ranganathan’s Colon Classification (1933) and
  the second edition of the Bliss Bibliographic Classification (of which the
  first volume was published in 1977) have been welcomed as theoretical
  developments, but are applied almost exclusively in Ranganathan’s native
  India and in England (the country where the Bliss system was developed)
  respectively.
                    Use
  The importance of cataloguing and classification is that they facilitate use, for it
  is in being used that books gain their meaning. While private collectors such as
  Robert Cotton in Britain and Cardinal Mazarin in France have opened their
  libraries to scholars, it is primarily the book in the institutional library that has
  had a major impact on knowledge and research from the earliest times onwards.
  Callimachus used the library at Alexandria to compile his extensive bio-
  bibliographical Pinakes, ‘Tables of Persons Eminent in every Branch of
  Learning, together with a List of their Writings’, covering all Greek writings.
  Multiple holdings of the writings of Homer were used at the Alexandrian library
  to compile what was considered to be the definitive account. Jerome in the late
  fourth century CE used the early Christian library at Caesarea to write his Latin
  Vulgate and other works. Bede relied upon the monastery libraries of
 Wearmouth and Jarrow in the eighth century to compose his Ecclesiastical
  History of England. The scholar-printer Aldus Manutius based many of his
  early-fifteenth-century Greek classics on manuscripts from the Biblioteca
  Marciana in Venice. Karl Marx did much of his research and writing in the
  round Reading Room of the British Museum Library. Institutional library
  holdings are the basis for retrospective national bibliographies, and to a large
  extent for censuses of specific works detailing the history of copies of texts as
  diverse as Shakespeare’s First Folio, the Kelmscott Chaucer and the first and
  second editions of Copernicus’s De Revolutionibus, the latter based on the
  holdings of libraries in thirty-one countries. A list of eminent users of the
  British Museum Library provides a glimpse into the research value of institu-
  tional libraries, with names ranging from the philosophers David Hume
  and Jeremy Bentham to the historian Edward Gibbon, mathematician Charles
 Babbage and economist Walter Bagehot.*

    considered to be the founder of modern Chaucer editing: of the twenty-six
    manuscripts he consulted for his text, nine were at the British Library, six
     at the Bodleian Library, one at New College Oxford, two at Cambridge
    University Library and two at Trinity College, Cambridge. It is when books
     reach institutional libraries, moreover, that historians of reading are enabled
     to see how famous intellectuals have interacted with them through marginal
     notes, scribbled legally before the books became institutional property or
     illegally afterwards. Examples include Thomas Carlyle’s notes on his books
    about Oliver Cromwell and Frederick the Great (at Harvard University) and
    Martin Heidegger’s on books at the University of Freiburg.
              Wider implications of libraries
    Reading and research are the raison d’étre of books in libraries, but their
    impact is more widespread. The book in the library has had, and continues to
     exert, an influence on publishing patterns. Most notably, the circulating
     libraries’ support of the three-volume novel in Victorian Britain enabled its
    continuation after the single volume became common: when Mudie’s and
     Smith’s decided in 1894 to stop purchasing the so-called three-decker, it
     collapsed. The decision by Mudie’s to buy or not to buy a novel in bulk
    could make or mar an author’s prospects. American school district libraries
     originated in New York State in 1838 and acquired 400,000 books over three
     years, providing several publishers with a ready market for cheap books
    which the publishers sold on commission through local representatives.
     Sales of scholarly monographs and journals today are driven by the academic
     institutional market. The social impact of books can be yet wider: the histor-
     ian George Grote, Vice-Chancellor of the University of London from 1862 to
    1871, used the regular presence of ‘a considerable number of females’ reading
    and writing in the British Museum library to argue in 1862 that women
    should be permitted to take University of London degrees, an innovation
     finally agreed in 1877 which made his University the trailblazer of tertiary
    education for women in England.> Arguments for and against the establish-
    ment of public libraries supported by the taxpayer in England focused on such
     factors as the power of the book to stir up discontent among the working
     classes on one hand and its ability to educate them and entice them away from
     less salubrious haunts (public houses) on the other; the same arguments that
    were used across Europe for and against the inculcation of literacy.
     Moreover, books in libraries confer status on authors, on collections and
     on library owners. For classical authors, acceptance of works they donated

     to thereby their reputations
 (depending on the retention policy of the library) to immortalize themselves.
 Conversely, exclusion from a library was a mark of social disapproval,
 demonstrated when the Roman poet Ovid, banished from Rome to Témis,
 lamented the removal of his works from the public libraries of Rome. While
 the quantity of holdings overall and in particular areas, typically early printed
 books, has been a status symbol, digitization from the 1990s onwards has
 been an equalizer. It enables numerous libraries, large and small, to offer the
 same journals and early printed books in electronic form. With further books
 from the holdings of such major collections as Oxford and Harvard being
 made available electronically and freely via Google, Inc., emphasis has turned
 to what libraries can offer that is unique or ‘special’, with particular stress on
 books given added significance by their context, such as their place within
 named special collections, and on copy-specific features.
   Status extends from the library to its owner, sometimes with political over-
 tones. Ancient libraries were located in temples or palaces. Ptolemy I is thought
 to have founded the library at Alexandria in order to stabilize Greek culture in
 Egypt. The library at Pergamon was established in the second century BCE to
 compete with that at Alexandria; a large statue of Athena and busts reinforced
 the message of dominating culture. Trajan’s library, dedicated in CE 112/113,
 contained lavish stone and marble decoration. Outstanding large and airy later
 examples include the Vatican Library, begun in 1475, with marble, frescoes and
 some stained glass, and Michelangelo’s Bibliotheca Medicea Laurenziana in
 Florence, opened in 1571, with a carved roof, patterned floor, walnut book-
 shelves and stained glass windows featuring the arms of the ruling Medici. The
 Escorial Library near Madrid, commissioned by Philip II, had walls and a high
 barrel vault roof painted in fresco, fluted Doric columns and large mahogany
 bookcases inlaid with ebony, cedar and other woods: magnificence which
 redounded to the monarch’s glory. That the large, domed Viennese court library,
 finished in 1735 with space for 200,000 books, was designed to show state
 power is evident from a fresco on the ceiling depicting Karl IV (1685-1740) asa
 warrior. Closer to our own time, the Library of Congress was built 1886-97 in
 an Italian Renaissance style with a gold-plated dome and plentiful use of granite
 and marble. It was adorned inside with sculpture and paintings as a cultural
 monument intended both to link the US to European Renaissance learning and
 to demonstrate American wealth, culture and technology.
               Preservation and loss
 A reason why libraries are integral to the history of the book is their instru-

     began in the US with the microform publication in 1936 of the New York
     Times, 1914-18. The microfilming of other newspapers soon followed, as did
     that of early printed books (the first unit of Early English Books appeared in
     1938), and subsequently other items which provide an insight into book
     history, such as marked-up auction sale catalogues. Large-scale digitization,
     combining preservation and access, began in the 1990s.
      Sheer acquisition is another element of preservation. The function of
     national libraries is to collect and preserve all publications emanating from
     or pertaining to the respective nation, as well as a selection of other important
     literature. They have been assisted in this by laws requiring the deposit of
     one or more copies of every title printed in a given country in a particular
     library or libraries of that country. To an extent the collection policy of
     national libraries has rendered preservation a national preserve. Practical
     considerations (readability) reinforce the national aspect. A library in an
     English-speaking country will probably have foreign translations of an
     English writer’s work only as part of a special collection (often based around
     an author and designed to include as many manifestations as possible of the
     chosen writer’s work), whereas the translations are the norm in libraries in
     countries where the language of the translation is spoken. A full picture of a
     book’s history might thus be acquired through manifestations of that book in
     libraries in several countries. But as demonstrated by reference to the ambi-
     tious acquisition policies of people like Ashurbanipal and Sir Thomas Bodley,
     books have always travelled, and sometimes books emanating from one
     country are present only in another. According to an analysis done in
     2002-3, 12 per cent of Italian editions of incunabula were not held in Italy,
     for example, and roughly one-third of incunabula with imprints from the
    Low Countries were present only outside them, while ro per cent of British
     imprints 1476-1800 were not held in Britain and 628 items with American
     imprints were to be found only outside the US.°
      This latter point draws attention to a less positive feature, the failure of
     libraries to preserve books. The quantity of books apparently surviving in very
     few, unique or indeed no copies testifies to this: an estimated 27 per cent of the
     28,000 editions recorded on the Incunabula Short-Title Catalogue (ISTC) are
     recorded in unique copies, while possibly more editions have been com-
     pletely lost than have survived.” These are not the only printed books, not to
     mention manuscripts, to have disappeared without trace. Cheap, small, ephem-
     eral publications which were read to tatters, such as chapbooks and
     schoolbooks, were particular victims. The first English ABC book, Thomas
     Petyt’s The BAC [sic] Bothe in Latyn and in Englysshe ([1538]) is known from

     1594, in England, to the Bodleian Library, in 1610, in Spain in 1619, Prussia in
     1624, Sweden in 1661, Denmark in 1697, Finland in 1702 and in Italy in 1743
      (in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany) and 1788 (in the Duchy of Milan). It was not
     always upheld, such that, for example, although 693 new items were published
     in 1800 in London alone, Cambridge University Library received just over fifty
     publications from that year, at least twenty-two of them provincial. Only when
     Cambridge University Library and the British Museum undertook prosecu-
     tions in the early and mid-nineteenth century respectively did British publishers
     observe it seriously. And even when publishers found it in their interests to
     observe legal deposit, libraries were cavalier: in the eighteenth century both the
     Bodleian Library and Cambridge University Library sold non-academic mate-
      rial to local booksellers. Libraries have ejected books in standard weeding
     processes in the interests of space and relevance, and in order to raise funds
      for new stock or other purposes. Only in national and major academic libraries
      is permanent retention a goal, and even the British Museum sold duplicate
     editions in major sales between 1769 and 1832. A vivid example is portrayed in
     Figure 2.1. The stock of dispersed libraries is known today partly through their
     ownership marks in books in other institutions.
      Moreover, even when libraries were hampered in their acquisitions, they
     could decide what to exclude. Most Roman emperors before Constantine
     suppressed Christian writings, while some Christian bishops suppressed
     pagan writings. The great medieval Islamic libraries collected all subjects
     except the literature of other faiths. Mudie’s Select Lending Library assured
      its Victorian readers that it stocked no books which could cause the slightest
     embarrassment when read aloud within the family circle. After the 1917
     Russian Revolution collections were weeded for books containing undesir-
     able information, and public libraries in Russia could acquire only books
     published in Russia or officially approved for Russian use. In Communist
     countries the state aimed to use libraries to propagate Marxist-Leninist
     philosophy and help people become better Soviet citizens. Public libraries
     everywhere supported the dominant political and social system, such that in
     1928 the American Library Association cautioned, in its guide to periodicals
     for small libraries, against magazines with dubious political and social theo-
      ries and undesirable fiction. The Association decided in favour of lifting
     censorship with a Library Bill of Rights only in 1939, with censorship linger-
     ing for children’s books as a protective measure.
       In more thoroughgoing censorship, Caliph Omar is reputed to have
     ordered the destruction of the Alexandrian Library in CE 640 on the basis
     that if the writings of the Greeks agreed with the Qur’an they were not

             libraries of and Cambridge under Henry VIII
  (1535), Edward VI (1549) and Mary (1556-7) to purge the universities of
  heretical books, first Catholic and then Protestant, resulted in wide-scale
  conflagrations. The 1930s and 1940s saw the systematic removal and burn-
  ing of writings by Jewish writers in German public libraries, and this was
 followed by the removal of Nazi propaganda from such libraries by the Allies
  after their victory.
  Whereas censorship is focused, other forms of destruction have been less
  discriminating, and it is precisely the aggregation of books that makes them
  vulnerable. Some libraries, like Thomas Bray’s British and American paro-
  chial ones, withered from neglect. Others across the ages have been the partial
  or complete victims of fire: for example, the Palatine Library in CE 64; the
  Imperial Library of Constantinople in CE 476/7; the Royal Library of Sweden
  in 1658; the Escorial Library in 1761; the University Library of Copenhagen
  in 1728; Harvard in 1764; the Library of Congress, most notably in 1851; the
  University of Virginia in 1895; the National Library of Peru in 1943; and the
 Academy of Sciences in St Petersburg in 1988. Floods have also wreaked
  havoc, for example at the Royal Library of Portugal (accompanied by earth-
 quake) in 1755; at the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale and other libraries in
  Florence in 1966, resulting in the loss of more than two million volumes; and
  in the Czech republic in 2002. Warfare has caused further wanton destruc-
  tion, from Danish and Viking invasions of Anglo-Saxon England to the
  Peasants’ War in Germany of 1524-5, the Thirty Years War of 1618-48,
  the First World War (including the burning by German troops in 1915 of
  the University Library of Louvain, founded 1425) and the Iraqi War of 2003.
 Air raids during the Second World War saw the loss of 250,000 books at the
  British Library alone. Italy lost two million books in air raids, Germany and
  Britain more (Britain is thought to have lost over twenty million volumes
  in libraries, bookshops and publishing firms), and over 100 million books
  are thought to have been lost between 1941 and 1944 in the Soviet Union.
 The dissolution of monasteries — in England in 1536-40; in Austria,
 France and Germany in the late eighteenth century; in Portugal in 1834;
 in Spain in 1836 — resulted in enormous losses, and the French Revolution
 led to the removal of books from the libraries of noblemen and religious
 institutions.

     others were sent to enrich the university library of Uppsala and the royal
     library at Stockholm. Archbishop Matthew Parker’s salvation of manuscripts
     from English monastic libraries benefited the Parker Library at Corpus
     Christi College, Cambridge. Numerous books confiscated during the French
     Revolution made their way to the Bibliotheque Nationale and to new French
     municipal libraries. The Bayerische Staatsbibliothek in Munich was a major
     beneficiary of the dissolution of the German monasteries, although by no
     means the only one: via the individual German collector Georg Kloss, who
     garnered entire monastic libraries and whose books were sold by Sotheby’s in
     London in 1835 and 1841, German monastic books entered institutional
      libraries throughout Great Britain and America.
      The book in the library contributes to the history of the book not merely
     through its own artefactual value but through institutional records. Accounts
     provide information about chaining and unchaining; donors’ registers and
     other accession lists indicate what entered a library when and from what
     source and possibly, if subsequently annotated, what was discarded when;
     library committee minutes reveal a library’s treatment of and attitude towards
     books. Registers of users can suggest the influence of books in libraries, and
     circulation registers imply the popularity of particular books as well as their
     influence on specific people (although borrowing and reading do not always
     equate): an early example is the loan records of the endowed library of
     Innerpeffray in Scotland, whose loan registers go back to 1742.
       In 1986 John Feather wrote: ‘[Book history and library history] are depen-
     dent upon each other, for the books whose history the book historian seeks to
     study are very largely the books that have been preserved for him by generations
     of collectors and librarians, while the library historian cannot ignore the books
     which are, after all, the raison d’étre of the library itself. Just as the history of the
     book is a vital part of the history of our culture, so the history of libraries is a
      vital part of the history of the book.”? By digitizing holdings and by cataloguing
     books with growing attention to their history, libraries are making books
     increasingly available and research on those books increasingly feasible —
     among other elements, the history of reading. But for the history of libraries,
      it is the collection as a whole that compels attention.

                TRISH LOUGHRAN
        Books in the nation
     The history of the book is that rare field that speaks simultaneously in
     two registers, describing epic transformations via small scraps of paper. The
     great titles of print history in particular announce themselves with fanfare.
      In 1958, Lucien Febvre and Henri-Jean Martin wrote of ‘the coming of the
     book’, as of some great sacral event. In 1962, Marshall McLuhan conjured
      ‘the Gutenberg galaxy’. And in 1979, Elizabeth Eisenstein titled her massive,
     two-volume history of post-Gutenberg Europe The Printing Press as an
     Agent of Change, arguing that printing was ‘an unacknowledged revolution’
     that had remade the world from 1450 forward. In each case, the historical
     model is one of impact (like an asteroid) or revolution (like a world-historical
     war). Even Benedict Anderson, in his more modestly titled study Imagined
     Communities (1983), insists on the seismic impact of what he calls print
     capitalism. All of these scholars imagine print, the printing press, the book
     and/or print capitalism as emanating from a singular point in time and space —
     from Gutenberg’s press, which in 1450 first introduced moveable type in
     Europe and then seems to have exported it everywhere. The purpose of this
     chapter is to revisit that argument and place pressure on it from below, with
     special attention to the question of how, when and why two deeply European
     forms — the nation and the (Gutenberg) book — came to be synonymous not
      just with one another but with liberal progress and, indeed, with our ongoing
     idea of what it means to be modern.
                The printing press cometh
      Eisenstein’s Printing Revolution in Early Modern Europe opens with an
     image titled “The Press Descending from the Heavens’ (Figure 3.1), which
      first served as the frontispiece to a much earlier history of print: Prosper
     Marchand’s 1740 Histoire de l’origine et des prémiers progrés de l'imprim-
      erie. As Eisenstein notes, the image depicts ‘the spirit of printing ... descend-

     iconic hand press ‘first to Germany, who then presents it to Holland, England,
     Italy, and France (reading from left to right)’.* Allegorical figures representing
     these different countries hold ‘medallion portraits of master printers’ (includ-
     ing the Germans Gutenberg and Fust; the English Caxton; the Italian Aldus
     Manutius; and the Dutch Laurens Koster). In this way, the image quietly
    makes a point that many of the foundational figures of modern book history
     were also making in the 1970s and 198os: it implies a strong link between
     nation and print, evoking an orderly, isomorphic, proto-nationalist series of
     territorially delimited identities.
      The image operates on two planes. It illustrates the top-down transmission
     of the hand press, first from the heavens to earth and then from royally garbed
     allegorical figureheads (very like kings or queens) to the mere men represented
     on each medallion. But it also figures (in its evocation of Germany, England,
     Italy and Holland) the horizontal spread of the liberal nation state as it exists
     geographically in real (European) space, with different countries spread out
     fairly evenly along a horizontal plane (though Germany is given a slight sense
     of vertical priority, as the site of printing’s origin). It thus depicts something
     both mythic and mundane, commemorating a key moment of historical
     change in which the printing press is almost always present. We are witness-
     ing here not just the divine transfer of a technology or its iconic object but
     what Karl Polanyi calls ‘the great transformation’ from feudal to capitalist
     culture. Eisenstein famously emphasizes this moment as a shift from antiquity
     (with its Greek gods) to modernity (with its earthbound humans). A number
     of book scholars after her would go on to intensify that account, describing
     the emergence of print culture as a shift from an old world order, in which
     objects, people and power are hierarchically organized in vertical tiers (as in
     dynastic monarchy) to another, more modern world order, made up of equals
     spread evenly across the globe (Germans, Englishmen, Italians, Frenchmen,
    Dutchmen), people whose only difference in the syntax of world history will
     be where each one appears in the unfolding narrative of what Marchand
     called ‘progress’.
      The image thus renders the Coming of Print as a story of European people-
     hood — a geopolitical story, as the story of print inevitably must be, but also a
    modern and classically liberal geopolitical story with a representative human
     being at its centre (the Master Printer), who facilitates the emergence of the
     new order of the modern liberal state just as much as presidents and prime
     ministers do (and via the same representative logic), We are witnessing here
     not just the birth of printing but the birth of all the (western) things we
     habitually associate with print: Europe, modernity and the nation state itself,
      still tricked out in the trappings of monarchy but already embedded in the

           lies
  receives the gift of print) and space (where each lies on the European map, or
  in the syntax of the sentence of progress).
   Placed at the front of Eisenstein’s book, as it once sat at the front of
 Marchand’s, the image serves as a kind of long Enlightenment mise-en-
 abyme, a wormhole that viscerally connects Eisenstein to her print-history
  precursor. Many scholars date the current practice of book history to work
  like Eisenstein’s, but as her homage here suggests, her work is the Second
 Coming of something much older. The image works, for Eisenstein, both as
  an icon in its own right and as a more mundane archival example of how
  printers advertised their own importance. By placing it where she does yet
  assigning this circumscribed (even petty) function to it, Eisenstein does what
  print history has always done: she capitalizes on the depiction of a moment
  of transformation, a shift from this way of organizing the world to that, in
  order to evoke the longer history of western progress (or modernization),
  an unfolding series of events that places her, and the field she represents,
 somewhere far right (reading, like a book, ‘from left to right’), out of the
 frame but still in the same unfolding sentence whose first uttered syllables
 were ‘Gutenberg’.
         Imagined Communities as universal history
 Benedict Anderson’s Imagined Communities — the most well-known and
  influential book to link nation and print — was built on the earlier work of
 Febvre, Martin, McLuhan and Eisenstein, just as theirs were built ideologi-
  cally on accounts like Marchand’s. Anderson’s subtitle, in fact, uncannily
 echoes Marchand’s. Where Marchand spoke in 1740 of “The Origin and
 Early Progress of Printing’, Anderson speaks of “The Origin and Spread
 of Nationalism’. Writing in a period marked by renewed ethnic violence (in
  eastern Europe, central Africa and South Asia), Anderson was working, in
 1983, to recuperate nationalism, taking the sympathetic position of the
 anthropologist-observer, whose conception of culture involves not just an
 expanded gaze across space but an equally comprehensive grasp of what is
 sometimes called modern history, a periodization that continues to start the
 clock on the world we live in today at or around Gutenberg-time: c. 1450.
 While the book historians who preceded him favoured smaller (national
  or continental) scales, Anderson’s [account ] [is ] [improbably ] [and ] [impressively ]
 global. He is very much a theorist [of ][what ] [Immanuel ] [Wallerstein ] [calls ] [the ]

      Anderson memorably defines the nation as ‘an imagined political commu-
     nity’, and this definition proves plastic enough to service his spatially far-flung
     but temporally staggered account of ‘the origin’ and ‘spread’ of the modern
     nation state.* Neither idea was new in 1983. Earlier scholars had already
     begun to place pressure on the idea of national antiquity, questioning the
    commonplace, racialized assumption that nations were the lineal descendants
     of ancient groups whose origins reached back to the deep recesses of ethnic or
     tribal history. Indeed, by 1983, scholars had already decisively denaturalized
     the nation state, showing that ‘in spite of [its] claims to antiquity, nationalism
     was a late eighteenth-century creation’ that ‘owed its origins to [the] secular-
     ization of political thought generated by the Renaissance and the
     Enlightenment, to the egalitarian principles of liberalism, and to the concep-
     tions of republicanism and citizenship popularized by the upheavals of the
     American and French revolutions’.’
      Anderson intervened in this emerging consensus in two notable ways.
     First, he shifted the origin-site of nationalism from the Old to the New
     World, arguing that the nation-form originates in the Americas, where,
     between 1776 and 1830, ‘the first substantial plurality of nation-states’
     emerged.* The US is thus given pride of place at the scene of creation (as
    Germany was in Marchand’s engraving), followed closely by those Latin
    American states that forged themselves out of the debris of Spanish and
     Portuguese empire to the south. Anderson’s second major intervention was
     his famous turn to print. Imagined Communities was, in 1983, a far more
     materialist approach to nationalism than had ever been theorized by poli-
      tical scientists, even as it offered a far more extended account of the decisive
     linkage between print and nation than any book scholar had yet produced.
    And though later editions of Imagined Communities extended its reach to
     institutions like museums and objects like the chronometer, it has been
     Anderson’s turn to print culture - and especially to what, with enduring
     specificity, he calls print capitalism — that has most impacted existing
     scholarship, generating an enormous number of nation-based readings of
     print culture (and, conversely, print-based readings of nationalism) that all
     tend to share four premises. This scholarship generally assumes, first, that
     nations are invented, and they were invented rather recently, dating to the
     rise of global capitalism in the Renaissance in some accounts and to the late
     Enlightenment in others. Second, this body of scholarship understands
     nationalism to consist primarily of imagined connections between people
    who will never meet face to face yet who identify with each other as
     fellow nationals in ways meaningful enough to power life and death.
     Third, printed texts are agreed to be the primary mechanism by which

                              to vice
  versa.
   Anderson’s Imagined Communities is by far the most famous of these studies
  linking nation and print, all of which generally focus on the same momentous
 transformation depicted in ‘The Press Descending from the Heavens’. But
 Anderson does something for book history that few others had done before
 him: he aggressively reorients Marchand’s epic snapshot into linear historical
  time, in the process assembling a much more attenuated narrative history of
  print’s spread across global space — a kind of morphology of modernity, in
 which print and nations will play equally important, mutually constitutive
  roles. Marchand’s frontispiece emphasizes in one elegant freeze-frame the
 well-known antinomies of ancient and modern, mythic and historical, heaven
 and earth, the sacred and the secular, monarchy and nation state. For
 Anderson, however, this scene emphatically initiates a series of dialectical
 ruptures on a much longer timeline. Imagined Communities identifies four
  stages of nationalism in all, variants that are presented not as a static taxonomy
  (as we sometimes see in comparative histories) but that instead evolve at
 staggered intervals in a series of ‘waves’ that wash across the planet through
  the long arc of several centuries, moving from the western hemisphere to the
  east between the years 1776 and 1983, at which point the nation is said to have
 emerged as ‘the legitimate international norm’.* The first of these four waves is
  Creole Nationalism, originating in the Americas between 1776 and 1820. The
 second is the class of popular ethno-linguistic nationalisms that spread
 throughout Europe in the mid-nineteenth century, borrowing from the first
 variant as they went. The third, again formed in reaction to what preceded it, is
  styled Official Nationalism (explicitly generated through state propaganda that
 was ‘historically “impossible” until after the appearance of popular linguistic-
 nationalisms’). And finally, the ‘Last Wave’ completes nationalism’s spread
 when it reaches the colonial territories of Asia and Africa in the twentieth
 century, as ‘a response to the new-style global imperialism made possible by
 the achievements of industrial capitalism’.°
   Just as nationalism is understood to have variants, print capitalism likewise
 has room to develop and adapt alongside these variations. Anderson’s
 account of Creole nationalism, for example, is dominated by a small number
 of master printers and newspapermen; popular-linguistic nationalisms
 involve a much wider diffusion of texts; ‘Official Nationalism’ seizes these
 populist energies from the top down and rechannels them through propa-
 ganda; and the ‘Last Wave’ [benefits ] [not ] [just ][from ] [print ] [but ] [from ] [numerous ]

     a grand universal history. In this way, Anderson’s account of print capitalism
    proves wonderfully plastic and contingent. Sometimes it’s conceived of as
    something that materially circulates across space, creating fields of exchange.
    At others it’s described (as in Eisenstein) as a technology that standardizes
    text and creates ‘print-languages’. And at others it is merely the carrier of
    literary genres (like novels and newspapers, or philologies, dictionaries and
    grammars). For Anderson, each new ‘wave’ offers both repetition and differ-
    ence — a framework for formal innovation that he calls modularity, in that
    each wave models itself on the previous one but also adapts the blueprint in
    order to bequeath a new model to the next wave. Successive waves of
    nationalists are thus dubbed borrowers, adapters and even pirates — with
    Europe positioned midpoint in the narrative between America and Africa,
    dethroning it from its conventional (more primary) position in other modern-
    ization narratives.
     This overt attempt to provincialize Europe works best, however, only in an
    Anglo-American context (and especially from an American point of view).
    On the global scale on which Anderson’s story takes place, the shift from
    Europe to the Americas hardly makes his history less European in deeper
    origin. Because the (American) colonies in this case are all some version of
     settler colonies, the Western Hemisphere winds up serving as a proxy for
    Europe rather than a decisive displacement of it. And though Anderson never
    says so, the revolutions that fabricate the nation-form are in this account all
    white revolutions, initiated by a class of settler-revolutionaries unironically
    dubbed ‘Pioneers’. (The Haitian Revolution, which spanned 1791 to 1804,
    would be an exception to this racial rule, but Anderson doesn’t explore it,
    making it a silent anomaly in his dialectical taxonomy of New World, Old
    World and Third World nationalisms.) The view from Port-au-Prince or
    Kolkata, Johannesburg or, indeed, from the Pine Ridge Reservation in
    Indian Country, is not likely to look that different, whether the nation-form
    originates with the white nation states of Europe or the white settler-states of
    the Americas.
     Nevertheless, this model has proven compelling to scholars of both nation-
    alism and print culture because it’s a model — a flexible account that can be
    applied almost anywhere or any place we see print and nation collide on the
    world historical stage. It sees the nation state, like the Gutenberg press, as a
    kind of moveable type, positing ‘the nation’ as a modern, western form that
     starts in one place and then is exported in temporal and spatial ‘waves’ that
    spread like a Euro-American tsunami, as the culture of the Global North
     solidifies itself (first here, then there, there and there) and then slowly washes
    over the Global South. It thus reinforces a linear, western account of world

                to — and today, post-Cold War, or
  neoliberal — narratives of progress. The fact that this story germinated during
  the Cold War and became a cornerstone of academic orthodoxy just as a new
  phase of globalization was getting under way is hardly a coincidence. Print-
  based accounts of the rise of nationalism do not, after all, simply theorize
  history; they take place in it.
      Particularizing the universal: case studies across the timeline
  The Imagined Communities thesis, which elaborated a link between nation
  and print that book historians were already gesturing towards in the 1960s
  and 1970s, triggered two successive waves of book scholarship. The first has
  tended to develop and affirm the link between nation and print (describing the
  rise of national print infrastructures, for example, in tandem with the rise of
  democratic polities), while the second has begun to test the limits of the
  imagined communities thesis and in some cases to dismantle it. And while
  this second school of thinking is a diverse and robust one, it’s rarely one that
  approaches the question within the generalized framework I’ve described
  here. Historians — especially book historians — have generally contested the
  idea of the imagined community on the more local ground of different area
  studies, where it has proven easier to contest the shifting specifics of how print
 works in this or that setting, in this or that epoch (from sixteenth-century
 Europe to the eighteenth-century Americas to twentieth-century Africa and
  Asia). It is thus not unusual to see engagement with Anderson’s core narrative
  across a wide array of regional or national studies within highly specific
 temporal brackets.
   Scholars in early American studies, for example, have questioned the
  notion that New World print culture is directly linked to the rise of nation-
  alism there. Ed White notes that this argument relies ‘on a sleight-of-hand
  conflation of the American Revolution with the Latin American revolutions
  of a generation later, with a misleading caricature of print culture to
  the north’. Sara Castro-Klarén and John Charles Chasteen’s Beyond
 Imagined Communities takes an even more local approach, insisting that
 Anderson’s description of ‘the operations of Creole printing presses’ in Latin
 America is ‘false’ at ‘virtually every step’. They cite Frangois-Xavier Guerra,
 among others, whose research has shown that there was neither a newspaper
  nor a press in all of Chile until 1812, even though a ‘local junta had already
 assumed power’, well on their way to state-formation in the region. Even

     it was only in New Spain that ‘real newspapers’ flourished in the formative
    period, and scholars in the US context have argued much the same for North
    America. In both settings, local news was not the staple described in print-
    based readings of early nationalism, nor were newspapers. These scholars
    decisively show that print did not generate a sense of national identity in the
    materialist ways that someone like Anderson describes, if at all. To be sure,
    local and regional identities did exist in this period, but as work like Guerra’s
    proves, ‘periodical publications ... and the print market did not create those
     identities’, and they were, in turn, ‘not yet national in character’.”? The same
    point can be made for the state of print culture in 1776 Philadelphia or New
    York.® The now well-known fantasy of a class of incipiently national printer-
    newspapermen is just that —a fantasy, largely based, Ed White suggests, on an
    overreliance on Febvre and Martin’s hagiographic treatment of Benjamin
    Franklin in The Coming of the Book.’ In fact, Anderson’s belief in the
    universal utility of early modern print diffusion probably derives from the
    same source. He is especially fond of quoting The Coming of the Book’s
    diffusionist account of early European print culture and then extending that
    account out across other continents. ‘From [1480]’, Febvre and Martin
    declare, ‘it may be said of Europe that the printed book was in universal
    use’.*° And Anderson mistakenly assumes that this ‘universal’ process of
    diffusion is both accurate in its own right and infinitely extendable.
     Scholars working in later periods and other locations continue to test the
    link between nation and print in ways that place pressure on the particulars of
     this universal history of diffusion. Shawn Frederick McHale has shown that
    in Southeast Asia, print was not as secularizing as we might expect, even in the
    twentieth century: in Vietnam, the ‘imagined community’ of print tended to
    reinforce, rather than replace, religious belief, and Buddhist and Confucian
    identity was far more important in twentieth-century Vietnamese print cul-
    ture than political identity. In the African context, Christopher Miller and
    others have described a drive to use print capitalism to create a cosmopolitan
    African identity alongside nationalist ones. Finally, South Asian scholars like
    Rochelle Pinto and Anindita Ghosh have shown that nationalizing accounts
    of print culture tend to homogenize key differences between parts of massive
    continents (print means one thing in Delhi, another in Gao), even as they
    overstate print’s ability to create national coalitions across class.**
      In focusing on the relation between print capitalism and today’s nation
     state system (an outcome that was never inevitable and is still only provision-
    ally legitimate), the concept of the print-based (and highly modern) ‘imagined
    community’ minimizes all the other book cultures that flourished both before
    and after the coming of the hand press, before and after western-style litera-

                         not be linked at all to the rise
 of the global nation-form.** China, of course, is notable because it possessed
 indigenous print technology centuries before Gutenberg, but Reed shows that
 printing did not find a place in Shanghai until western lithography was
 imported in the nineteenth century, and even then it continued to be con-
 sumed by elites for many decades before ‘print capitalism’ in the modern sense
 could be said to have taken hold. The Gutenberg letterpress held little pur-
 chase in an elite calligraphic culture like Shanghai’s, which for quite some
 time had no use for it, either before or after western-style presses arrived on
 the mainland. Scholars who work on Muslim book culture across Africa and
 elsewhere note much the same disregard for letterpress printing even in a
 culture in which all classes had access to the Qur’an. In Muslim culture,
 readers continued to prefer handmade books or, later, lithographic reproduc-
 tions (as opposed to type) because in Islam, script is sacred.*? Both China and
 Muslim Africa, then, are cultures that resist the modernization narrative as it
 pertains to print capitalism, not because they weren’t or aren’t modern but
 because their writing systems and book cultures were in fact already more
 highly developed than Europe’s by the time the Gutenberg press arrived. In
 each case, a fixed set of cultural values was already well developed that the
 letterpress could not satisfy or revolutionize and certainly had no claim to
 modernize.
        The nation and the book as derivative discourse
 Still, it is not the specifics of any given nationalism that have made the idea of
 the imagined community so powerful but the putative symmetry and adapt-
 ability of the isomorphic nation-form — something that seems to have the
 ability to transcend language, culture and even power. Anderson repeatedly
 embraces ‘the formal universality of nationality’, noting that ‘in the modern
 world everyone can, should, [and] will “have” a nationality, [just] as he or she
 “has” a gender’. In today’s world, he writes, the nation state is the ‘legitimate’
 and ‘overwhelming norm’, the very saturation of which makes it available
 to all. ‘The ... idea of “nation” is now nestled firmly in virtually all print-
 languages; and nation-ness is virtually inseparable from political conscious-
 ness’. And while the temporal staggeredness and spatial spread of nationalism
 across the last three centuries has inevitably produced uneven effects in real
 time and space, the Andersonian narrative I have been describing here reads
 these gaps more as opportunities [for ] [collaboration ] [and ] [innovation ] [than ] [as ]
 part of the larger process of [incorporation ] [we ] [call ] [imperialism. ]

     similarly pure container for local differences. Perhaps it is not surprising,
     then, that Anderson’s favourite artefactual emblem of national isomorphism
     is the bilingual dictionary, a printed text that, he writes, first became popular
     in nineteenth-century Europe at the height of the philological craze that was
     spurred by growing national consciousness and that later became the first
     object of study for would-be revolutionaries during the bilingual decoloniza-
     tion struggles of the Last Wave. Nineteenth-century bilingual dictionaries,
    Anderson writes, ‘made visible an approaching egalitarianism among lan-
     guages — whatever the political realities outside, within the covers of the
    Czech—-German/German-Czech dictionary the paired languages had a com-
    mon status’.** Convinced that the symmetrical form of the bilingual diction-
     ary solves a problem of power, this account overlooks the ways that formal
    symmetry masks and often enables inequality. The first bilingual dictionaries
     and grammars, after all, actually far predate the populist productions of
     nineteenth-century Europe; such books were less the handbook of bourgeois
     revolution than the first thing printed on any imported press in colonies just
     about anywhere — a tool not of ‘approaching egalitarianism’ but of adminis-
     trative empire in North America, India, South Asia, the Caribbean and Africa.
      This is the problem with global readings that link print culture to modern
     nation formation. They read the liberal spread of national autonomy (and all
     the things that come with it: like dictionaries, novels and newspapers — and
     the western ontologies they carry) as a sign of freedom, rather than one of the
    cascading after-effects of empire. Nation-based accounts of print capitalism
     inevitably incorporate and coopt the cultural production of formerly
     colonized populations in liberated states (like India) even as they continually
     minoritize the writing of those indigenous and diasporic communities who
     continue to live in imperfectly decolonized spaces (like the US or New
     Zealand). When such accounts do consider how print capitalism was experi-
     enced and adapted by colonized populations (both slave and native) in places
     like the New World, that analysis is pressed into the service of a liberal master
     narrative to which such populations inevitably arrive belatedly. More often
     (as in Imagined Communities itself), such populations are not considered at
     all. Indeed, the borrowing and adaptation that mark Anderson’s account
     occur along a dispersed timeline, not within a synchronous and fragmented
     (and still quite vertically organized but contested) space like, say, the nine-
     teenth century Americas or contemporary Australia. Such spaces — the planet,
    we might say, at this or that particular moment — are instead naturalized in
    Anderson’s modernization narrative as planetarily uniform (or world-
     historical). New World slavery and the rise of settler colonialism are linked
    phenomena that are rarely mentioned in grand narratives like Imagined

 sively vanquish the latter. Anderson, for example, repeatedly describes great
 dynastic empires giving way to the flatter, more homogeneous and egalitarian
 form of the nation state. The doomed remnants of older empires (which
 persist in Europe and its dominions around the globe through the Official
 Nationalism period) are then, in his account, finally vanquished by the Last
 Wave of decolonization struggles — proof enough that the nation state is the
 political and spatial solution to the problem of empire, which is itself treated
 as a decaying remnant of premodern culture.
  But neither nationalism nor print capitalism is a natural antinomy to
 empire. The Gutenberg book and the nation form are both western inven-
 tions, as is the story that links their global spread. Though the nation state is
 often treated as a universal, neutral and unmarked form, equally available to
 all, it is in fact, as Partha Chatterjee states, ‘an export from Europe, like
 the printing press, the radio, and television’. And the implications of this
 ‘export’ are profound. ‘In agreeing to become “modern”,’ Chatterjee writes,
 the postcolonial nation state ‘accepts the claim to universality of this “mod-
 ern” framework of knowledge’ at the expense of its own history, its own
 tradition and its indigenous material (book) cultures, which forever after can
 and often are consigned to the realm of the premodern particular. *>
  In the end, however, all nationality is particular, and in the post-Gutenberg
 era it is also always already part of some larger colonial formation of identity.
 To think otherwise is to create a zero-sum historical condition in which all
 parts of the planet must either convert or be accommodated to the norm in
 order to be legible — or to survive as part of ‘modern’ history. Jean O’Brien
 has shown how a similar logic operated in the early Americas via the
 belief that ‘Indians can never be modern’: there, native cultures either assimi-
 lated to settler norms to prove their modernity (thus erasing their own
 cultures and their difference from the settler-state) or they were marked as
 primitively unassimilable and extinguished — either by forced ‘removal’ or by
 ethnic cleansing.’® A similar sort of absorption-and-erasure is in play in many
 accounts of how the nation state — and print — finally came to the Third
 World. An excellent example comes again from Imagined Communities,
 where Anderson describes Ieu Koeus, a Khmer revolutionary, as ‘a lineal
 descendant of the illustrious philologists of an earlier Europe, [who] ...
 designed a typewriter keyboard for the Khmer script and published a weighty
 two-volume Pheasa Khmer [The Khmer Language]’.'” This example poign-
 antly illustrates how postcolonial [nationalisms ] are consigned to what
 Chatterjee has called a ‘derivative’ [status ] [— ] [and ] [it ] [does ] [so ] [at ] [the ] [level ] [of ]
 both language and print.*® [Ieu ] [Koeus ] [was, ] [in ] [fact, ] [a ] [radical ] [anti-western ]

     history, Koeus’s philological work is not understood as either revolutionary or
     original but is instead styled ‘a lineal descendant’ of a model inherited from
    Europe — a derivative, last-wave knock-off. This is the dilemma faced by all
     postcolonial book cultures and indigenous writing systems that arise after
    Gutenberg — from Koeus’s Khmer typewriter to the Cherokee syllabary to
    West Africa’s Vai script — when understood within a model that naturalizes
     the universal diffusion of western forms, a model in which both modern book
     culture and the current nation state system are deeply implicated. Yet this is not
     a critique that has been taken up by book historians in the same way that it has
     been taken up by political theorists like Chatterjee. While book historians have
     chipped away at the facts and figures behind this master narrative,
     they continue to ignore the ways in which print capitalism is accepted not
     just as regional history but as universal history. But it is, in fact, the cult of
    Gutenberg — and our faith in universal diffusion — that we would do well to
     unsettle.
            The challenge of decolonizing book history
     Even today, with intense intellectual and economic pressure to recast the
     national in more global terms, the history of the book as a field has trouble
     not thinking about print as the agent of a western liberal tradition, with the
     nation state as its political cornerstone. David Finkelstein and Alistair
    McCleery cite no fewer than twenty-two multivolume but explicitly national
     publishing initiatives, most of them ‘Anglophone ... surveys covering
     Australia, the UK, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, Scotland, and the USA’,
     all of which are devoted to showing ‘the development of national print
     infrastructures’ and all of which were first published, remarkably, between
     1997 and 2010.” Even encyclopedias that take a more theoretically and
     spatially ‘global’ view — like Blackwell’s Companion to the History of the
    Book (2007) or the Oxford Companion to the Book (2010) — often inadver-
     tently reinscribe the viral logic of the liberal nation state in the kinds of stories
     they tell and the shape those stories take within their table of contents. The
     Blackwell volume, for example, aggressively emphasizes the Gutenberg book,
     with just two chapters on “The World before the Codex’ followed by six on
     ‘The Book beyond the West’ and culminating in eighteen on ‘The Codex in
     the West 400-2000’.*° The Oxford volume likewise shows a strong Anglo-
    American bias, with three chapters on Britain bookended on the other side
     with one on ‘the History of the Book in America’. Within this stable
     Enlightenment framework, chapters on ‘Sub-Saharan Africa’, ‘The Muslim

 difference — that are either on their to
 belatedly absorbed into the existing system (like India) or that do the ideo-
 logical work of serving as minority discourse within the volume at large.
  Even as they attempt to include book cultures and writing systems from all
 times and places (from papyrus rolls to the undifferentiated ‘Muslim world’),
 such global accounts cannot escape the recurring imprint of universal history —
 the idea that ‘the book’ has evolved over time, as has geographic space, which is
 often organized in such volumes within the categories of national area studies.
 Thirty of the fifty essays in the Oxford Companion, for example, deal with
 geographic areas and regions, most of them nations, and their titling employs a
 generic repetition that makes them parallel, very much like the recurring
 medallions that march across Marchand’s frontispiece (‘The History of the
 Book in Britain ... in Ireland ... in France ... in Japan ... in China ... in
 Australia ... in New Zealand’). That isomorphic repetition is the formal mark,
 the sign and syntax, of the nation state system, the Westphalian grid and
 grammar that so compellingly materializes, before our very eyes, as on a
 map, the international norm so central to modern book history. The lingering
 residue of area studies is all the more interesting in the case of the Oxford
 Companion, because it specifically imagines itself as a global antidote to
 western parochialism. The preface offers the project as a ‘history of the book
 around the world, including the Muslim world, Asia, Latin America, and Sub-
 Saharan Africa’ (a list that clearly expresses a postcolonial desire to go global)
 while reviewers from Choice have praised its ‘global approach to the world of
 the book’.** Despite those ambitions, however, the Oxford volume, like the
 Blackwell volume before it, overwhelmingly rehearses a passion play about
 modernization, with a strong emphasis on narratives of liberalization and
 planetary development that is less postcolonial than what we might call neo-
 liberal: a justification for the world as we know it that absorbs local differences
 within a totalizing picture of the Gutenberg book’s global spread.
  Though there are exceptions, this is what postcolonial book history tends
 to look like today. It is, as Choice notes, ‘global’ — but it’s not yet decolonized.
 Book history today is dizzying in its diversity, filled with a seemingly infinite
 and quite ungraspable number of unique facts, figures and dates. But in more
 important ways, its encyclopedias and monographs often speak in unison. In
 particular, they almost all tell the story of modernization on the differentiated
 ground of this or that geographic locale. Ancient writing systems and book

     hence uneven, geographic diffusion). It is a story that is sometimes told as a
     tale of materials (from palm leaf to papyrus roll to parchment to paper to
     computer screen), sometimes as a tale of format (from orality to manuscript to
     print to digitization), and quite often as a literal tale of cultural diffusion, of
     that which is and is not European encountering one another, in different sites
     across the globe, to one common endpoint: the endpoint of the present, the
     globalized world of today. This narrative has not, of course, gone unchal-
     lenged, but it’s never gone away either. Choice hails the Oxford Companion
      as a guidebook for ‘the world of the book’, and in doing so concisely
     translates the incommensurability of geographic space (‘the world’) into the
     universal register of one object: ‘the book’. The totality of that formulation is
      a problem as old as empire itself.
      The challenge of decolonizing book history for the future will involve
     finding new ways to provincialize print capitalism, but this won’t be easy.
     The Anglophone tradition of the history of the book has a quite specific set
     of historical strategies for containing difference, a method that yokes it to
      its own twentieth-century origins, regardless of which century or continent
      it looks (back) at. Susan Buck-Morss calls for scholarship that can work
     through ‘the historical specificities of particular experiences, approaching
     the universal not by subsuming facts within overarching systems or homo-
     genizing premises, but by attending to the edges of systems, the limits of
     premises, the boundaries of our historical imagination’.** Book history
     would seem a perfect location from which to launch such a trouble-making
     project because it’s materialist, detail-oriented and historical. More than that,
      it’s about the ways that people connect and communicate across the divides of
     space, time and language. Nevertheless, the fact remains: there is no radical
     history of the book, no comprehensively leftist or revolutionary or decoloniz-
     ing tradition to speak of. There is no queer history of the book; there is no
     Marxist history of the book; and despite a massive global diffusion of the
     field, with production that ranges across every continent and in every known
     century, there is very little (in English) that we might truly call a postcolonial
     history of the book. The problem lies, I’ve suggested here, in how the field has
     historically mediated the universal and the particular — and to what ends. In
     this, the iconic picture of ‘the book’ (and in particular, the technology of print)
      is itself a major player, for the book seems like a neutral object but it’s one on
     which we have grounded a number of core cultural fantasies about equality.
    And none are more important, today, than the stories we continue to tell
     about the book’s relation to naturalized political forms like the nation state.
      The non-Gutenberg variation of the book has existed for centuries in parts
     of the world that had no use for moveable European type before — and, in

 state and the linear logic of geographic diffusion that sustains universal
 history? Like Anderson, the field at large accepts both the Gutenberg varia-
 tion of print and the nation as a ‘legitimate international norm’, and even
 as it tries to globalize its gaze, it continually falls into the zero-sum trap
 of chronological timelines and a closed world-system whose ‘modern’
 origins are dated to 1450. This is hardly surprising, for as I’ve argued here,
 Anglophone book history is — by the standards of ancient book cultures — a
 fairly recent discipline, one that has its origins in the liberal western
 Enlightenment and its global spread, a process that is not ending but intensi-
 fying under twenty-first-century globalization. If this is true, it means that the
 field itself - from Marchand to Eisenstein and Anderson to the book you hold
 in your hand right now — is materially implicated in the postcolonial contra-
 diction that Partha Chatterjee describes. Of the scholars cited in this chapter,
 only Chatterjee points out that the nation and the Gutenberg press are
 analogous (and contemporaneous) European exports, but his analysis of
 that connection is confined to a single sentence, and more work needs to be
 done to amplify that insight from within the domain of book history.
 Nationalism and print are two particular and connected ‘manifestation|s]
 of a much more general problem’, which Chatterjee identifies, in the end,
 as a problem of knowledge: ‘a conception of knowledge, established in the
 post-Enlightenment period of European intellectual history, as the moral
 and epistemic foundation for a supposedly universal framework’, a form
 of knowledge which pretends to be abstract, universal and ‘independent
 of cultures’.*+ But knowledge is never independent of either culture or
 power. And neither are books, of any kind, in any world — but especially,
 perhaps, in the Gutenberg world.

              SYDNEY SHEP
    Books in global perspectives
  In his 1983 address to the Bibliographical Society, D. F. McKenzie
 remarked that ‘what we much too readily call “the book” is a friskier and
  therefore more elusive animal than the words “physical object” will allow’.”
  Books as material artefacts can travel long distances, define different ideo-
  logical spheres, negotiate new diasporic identities and transform cultures.
  Books as texts can be translated, repurposed, remediated, their intellectual
  content appropriated, adapted and transformed over time and space. Books
  as transactions chart complex and often fluid networks between authors
  and readers, producers and consumers. And books as cultural metaphors
  can provoke affective experiences, both sacred and secular, that inspire
  ritual and revelation, memory and renewal. This chapter discusses a num-
  ber of ways in which books travel and transform, and takes as a starting
  point that the protean nature of books is one of their defining features.
  It engages with contemporary scholarship on transnationalism and post-
  coloniality. And finally, it concludes by introducing a new model for
 book history that repositions mobility at the heart of this interdisciplinary
  field of study.
            The mobile and mutable book
 When Samia Khatun visited a mosque in Broken Hill, New South Wales,
  Australia in 2009 to view what the locals proudly labelled a Qur’an, she found
  to her surprise and astonishment a well-thumbed Bengali puthi. How this
 five-hundred-page popular songbook printed in the port city of Kolkata in
  1896 travelled from India to the remote settlement of Broken Hill, via net-
 works of Afghan cameleers laying Australia’s overland telegraph and Bengali
  lascars working the ships across the Indian Ocean world, is a compelling tale
  of intersecting cultures, multidimensional expressive forms and disparate

     does not fit neatly into a narrow nationalist framework. Instead, this story,
     like countless others, foregrounds the mobility of people, places and commu-
     nication technologies (such as the book) and emphasizes the poetics and
     politics of information transmission. It also reflects Robert Escarpit’s com-
    ment that ‘when we hold a book in our hands, all we hold is the paper: the
    book is elsewhere’.’
      Unlike cave paintings, stelae, totems or monuments, the material form of
     the book is a fundamentally portable communication technology. In their
    landmark A History of Reading in the West, Guglielmo Cavallo and Roger
     Chartier note that ‘authors do not write books; they write texts that become
     material objects’.* Although there is always already an assumed physical or
     virtual instantiation, it takes the actions of various intermediaries (whether
     printers, publishers, distributors, librarians or educators) to place books in
     the hands and minds of their readers, and to complete, in effect, the com-
    munication process.* Book artists expose the bones of form and function,
     laying bare structural and intellectual skeletons in their creative entangle-
     ments with the medium. Mark Z. Danielewski’s House of Leaves (2000)
     and Only Revolutions (2006) bridge the worlds of print and digital culture
    and construct highly interactive, self-reflexive works. The gradual minia-
     turization of these containers of information from the large folio lectern
    codex bibles of the Renaissance to the eighteenth-century Latin duodecimo
     classics printed by John Baskerville, and from the pocket railway edition
    paperbacks of the late nineteenth to the e-readers of the early twenty-first
     century, is predicated upon an increasingly mobile readership demanding
     ease and immediacy of use as well as the right to personal property and
     portable devices.
     The intrinsic mobility of books transports ideas across physical, cultural,
     social and psychological boundaries. After all, the invention of moveable type
     in Korea in the thirteenth century enabled the unlimited reproducibility of the
    word and the potential industrialization of printing, even if it was not the
     preferred technology in Asia until the late nineteenth century. The reinvention
     of moveable type by Gutenberg in the fifteenth century and its adoption
    throughout Europe and beyond paved the way for the insertion of print
     into the spectrum of communication technologies. Print, however, was not
     necessarily fixed and immutable with an authority derived simply from multi-
     plicity and reach: the technical language of state, impression and edition all
     attest to a variability that is a hallmark of the process. And the very status of
     print was contested from the start, particularly in scientific communities
    accustomed to different authority structures and modes of dissemination.
    Moreover, books and print can foment rebellion if not instigate revolutions,

 Ninety-Five Theses nailed to a church door in Wittenburg, Germany helped
 change the shape of European Christianity, empowering the faithful through
  the medium of print with vernacular translations of the Bible and hymnody,
  as well as placing individual and private reading practices at the heart of the
 Protestant Reformation. The emancipation of knowledge was furthered in the
 Enlightenment with the publication of dictionaries, encyclopedias and other
  reference works that shifted the gaze from the curiosity cabinet to the world
 encompassed between two boards.
   In the long nineteenth century, the publishing industry responded to self-
  help initiatives promoted by the likes of Samuel Smiles, lifting the book out of
  the hands of the cultural elites and into the working class home. For figures
  such as the political journalist William Cobbett and the library-founding
 philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, knowledge was empowering and facilitated
 upward mobility and radical politics. It also provoked a questioning of
  authority as witnessed by the impact of Thomas Paine’s The Rights of Man,
 engendered the trade union movement to protect workers’ rights, and was a
  catalyst for the American, French and Indian Revolutions. An unassuming
 tome like The Little Red Book helped to consolidate the rule of Chairman
 Mao Zedong over Communist China during the Cultural Revolution. This
 book of quotations issued in pocketbook format with red vinyl covers was
  required reading for all party faithful. It was to be carried on one’s person at
  all times and was the object of daily study. Much like a traditional Chinese
 almanac, it offered guidance and advice, codes of conduct and models of
 behaviour; in terms of power politics, it was the propagandistic expression of
 Mao’s cult of personality. Yet, with over one billion copies printed between
  1964 and 1976, a feat that singlehandedly stretched, reshaped and modern-
  ized the entire Chinese publishing industry, and translated into over forty
 languages, The Little Red Book galvanized the world’s largest imagined
 community if not reading club.°
   It is no wonder, then, that translation has become a key concept to under-
 stand the restless book. Embedded in everyday life are phrases such as to throw
  the book at someone, to be in a person’s bad books, to bring to book or to
 speak like a book. Indeed, the legacy of bookness is manifested in the ongoing
  identity crisis of form and function in the digital domain: PowerBook,
 Super Book and Book Emulator join programs and applications such as
 MobilePress. Like metaphor, translatio is a rhetorical device predicated
 upon movement. Trading in translation rights, copyright and digital rights is
 big business at the Frankfurt or Kolkata Book Fairs. Linguistic translation,
 whether domesticated or foreignized, and what Roman Jakobson calls

    The industrialized book of the nineteenth century, colonial editions and other
     mass marketing ventures, plus the emergence of multinational corporations,
     all prefigure the era of e-books and innovative forms of online publishing,
    where mobility and mutability lie at the core of the user-generated experience.
    The ‘unbound book’ has become the mantra of writers, artists and publishers
     in the digital age.®
     We often forget that an entire facet of industrial design is devoted to the
     systematic organization of unruly books and the cultivation of sedentary
     reading experiences. Bookshelves, revolving book wheels, desks and reading
     furniture such as armchairs, sofas and prie-dieus all accommodate the physi-
     cality of the book form. Bookmobiles, camel trains and saddlebags help
     spread the word and eclipse distance. That manuscript books in monastic
     libraries had to be chained to reading desks suggests both their intrinsic value
     and their potential promiscuousness. And while the power of the press — that
     fourth estate — might be more imagined than real, for the gatekeepers of
    knowledge the threat is unmistakable. The control of literacy through educa-
     tion systems and the control of production and dissemination through copy-
     right are but two measures that constrain the protean book. In more extreme
     forms of censorship, the book itself becomes the victimized surrogate for an
     absent author, subjected to incarceration, burial, branding, mutilation or
     destruction by fire, most famously in ritualized burnings and burials in the
     Qin dynasty (213-206 BCE) or purges and pogroms in twentieth-century
     Nazi Germany and socialist Russia. Such forms of cultural genocide have
     been termed as variously bibliocide and libricide and documented the erasure
     of cultural memory and ethnic identity in the razing of the library of
     Alexandria, the bombing of cultural heritage institutions in Sarajevo, and
     the burning, then looting, of the National Library of Iraq under the eyes of the
    army of liberation.?
      Despite the sheer weight of cast iron printing presses, lead types and
     ancillary equipment, printing itself is a surprisingly portable technology.
     Printing presses operated in the back lines of the Napoleonic and American
     Civil Wars, printing dispatches, notices and other battlefield ephemera. Even
     the guerilla tactics of the displaced Boers during the Second South African
    War included field printing on a mobile press (‘drukkerij te veldt’) and
     capitalization of their war effort through a mobile mint. If battlefields accom-
    modated sites of print, troopships in the first and second world wars included
     printing offices for the production of magazines and newspapers on the high
     seas. Complementing shipboard libraries, such ventures gave outbound sol-
     diers an opportunity to while away the time, promote camaraderie amongst
    and lighthearted competition between officer class and the rank and file, and

 umenting the transition between their past lives and their new spaces of
  settlement, or for members of the Hudson’s Bay Company voyaging through
  Arctic waters on their way to outposts at the edge of the civilized world. The
 hunger for communication also arose in similarly ephemeral spaces: the
  goldfields. Newspapers followed the rhythms of boom and bust as temporary
  settlements sprang up around lucky strikes and equally quickly moved on to
  the next claim. Specially designed miniature print shops or parlour presses in
  the Victorian period shifted the production of books and print into the hands
  of private individuals and hobbyists, a sharp contrast to the highly structured,
  strictly gendered and rigorously policed trade training of the printing
  fraternity.
   Printers, like many members of the book trades, were peripatetic agents,
  transporting and transplanting their skills and expertise along the road and
  into shops, offices and houses around the world. As embedded in the trade’s
  traditional practices, successful apprentices became journeymen printers and
  were expected to travel before settling down. In the nineteenth century,
 however, this translated to a highly mobile workforce in a period of sustained
  technological change and global economic volatility. As tramping typogra-
  phers, printers on the move followed established seasonal circuits, usually
  localized or regional.*° Many became the equivalent of imperial careerists,
  following international and chain migration patterns, colony-hopping wher-
  ever opportunity and inclination led them. The result was the circulation of
  technological skills that added to the human chemistry of the print shop,
  linking printing traditions with localized practices, and enabling the develop-
  ment of new approaches to print in unfamiliar spaces.**
   William Colenso, for example, trained in his native Cornwall, travelled to
 London to work for the British and Foreign Bible Society, then shipped out to
 New Zealand as printer for the Church Missionary Society in 1834. Lacking
  standard English-language typecases, he commissioned a local carpenter to
  fashion a lay that accommodated the Maori alphabet of ten consonants and
  five vowels. When setting texts in English, he had to fossick through extra
  letters still in their twisted paper wrappers strewn around the print shop.
 Moreover, he had to make do with a small amount of type for composing in
 Maori and use paper borrowed from missionary wives to print, in pamphlet
  form, individual books of the Bible delivered to him once their translations
 were signed off by head office. His original commission, to print the entire
  bible in M4ori, was virtually impossible, with a non-existent workforce and a
  six- to nine-month wait for supplies. Even when completed, sheets had to be

    copy or exchanging a Bible for a gold coin. Demand outstripped supply and
    eventually printing was repatriated to London, but not without structural
    changes to the industry. The British and Foreign Bible Society responded to
    market demand by issuing bibles in smaller, cheaper formats, using thin,
     tissue-like Oxford bible paper and industrializing their bookbinding prac-
     tices, introducing case binding as a cheap alternative for a popular mass
    market. They also developed a transactional strategy linking buyers and
     sellers that cross-subsidised translations, enabled global distribution and
    promoted an international textual network.**
     The part publication practice of mission presses was less a spiritual policy
    than one born out of necessity and survival. Part publication in the form of
    serialization was a more sustained business strategy that enabled publishers
     to gauge market viability for a lengthy novel before committing to book
    production. The demand for cheap novels and serialized bestsellers in the
    Indian market and the Canadian and Australasian colonies forced London
    and Edinburgh publishing houses to restructure their business practices from
    manufacturing right through to distribution.‘? Whether issued as colonial
    editions or serialized in magazines and newspapers, the international circula-
     tion and reception of literary works created an integrated reading zone,
    collapsing any real or perceived distinction between centre and periphery.
    Serialization also changed authorial practices. Charles Dickens, for instance,
    mastered writing on the instalment plan, producing his work according to the
    imposition rhythms of twenty-four or thirty-two pages. The mass market
    appeal for the next issue saw battles fought at the docks over incoming
    shipments, as well as various attempts to clone, repackage or pirate successful
     stories in local publications. In 1838, Henry Dowling reprinted Pickwick
    Papers in Van Diemen’s Land (Tasmania), bringing the work out in an
    unauthorised part-issue format, followed by a single volume with pirated
     illustrations. The popularity of monthly and weekly magazines is evidenced
    by circulation figures which often belie the actual size of their readership,
     as well as by their global proliferation. Punch, or The London Charivari
    reappeared in well over a hundred guises around the world, spawning
    Taranaki Punch in New Zealand, Melbourne Punch in Australia, the Urdu
    Awadh Punch in India and many others that served local needs while retain-
    ing the satiric and iconoclastic spirit of the original. The now rare Illustrated
    London News Australasian Edition exemplifies what Law terms ‘the ability
     for the periphery not only to select its own reading but also to write back’.™4
    Newspapers with their cut-and-paste, snippet formula were a key player in
    the distribution of local and international news as well as literature in the
    nineteenth century and reflected the economies of scale possible for small,

                                   the repro-
 ductive technology of stereotyping which enabled texts to circulate widely
 and cheaply.
  Books are powerful talismanic pledges in the legal arena, initiating the
 performance of truth telling, or attesting to the symbolic value of Abraham
 Lincoln’s Bible upon which the Obama Presidency was founded. They are
 also key players in religious ritual, moving the spirit to realms beyond the
 mundane and diurnal. Whether it is the procession of the Christian Bible at
 the beginning of a church service, the enthronement of and obeisance to the
 Sikh Guru Granth in the Gurudwara (place of worship), the rituals surround-
 ing the housing and reading of the Torah or the spinning of a Buddhist
 dharmic wheel and recitation of mantras to enact faith, religious texts instan-
 tiated in material form fashion the iconic book.**
         The transnational and postcolonial book
 Nineteenth-century evangelical Protestant missionaries used the book,
 termed the ‘white man’s fetish’, to bring the light of faith and the civilizing
 power of empire to colonized peoples. Yet the transnational and translingual
 portability of The Pilgrim’s Progress led to John Bunyan’s story being
 naturalized in African tribal culture through multimedia and multilingual
 expressions of orature, performance and translation. Whether Bunyan is
 disaggregated and reconceptualized as image, illustration, photograph, post-
 card, magic lantern slide, pageant, sermon or hymn, Isabel Hofmeyr’s magis-
 terial study affirms that ‘when books travel, they change shape. They are
 excised, summarized, abridged, and bowdlerized by the new intellectual
 formations into which they migrate’.’® As a result, the ‘radical historicity’
 of this particular book sets the stage for integrating the local and global into a
 web of nodes and links that constructs a transnational Protestant public
 sphere and dismantles the divided terrains and politicized imperatives of
 centre and periphery. *”
  Hofmeyr’s latest work extends this transnational approach into a bio-
 graphy of Mahatma Gandhi’s printing press established in 1904 at the
 Phoenix ashram outside Durban, South Africa. The main publication of the
 International Printing Press was a multilingual newspaper, Indian Opinion,
 an instrument of social and political reform that linked Indians around the
 world and promoted what would later be termed satyagraha or passive
 resistance. Gandhi’s press became [the ] [hub ] [of ][a ] [utopian ] [settlement ] [run ] [on ]

    diasporic communities and underpinned Gandhi’s campaign for racial and
     social equality.
     Linguistic and bibliographic translations serve as barometers of the indi-
    genization and internationalization of books and printing, especially when
    religious and educational texts are rewritten. In his groundbreaking study
    Book History through Postcolonial Eyes: Rewriting the Script, Robert Fraser
    undertakes a highly nuanced, densely argued, comparative study of the
    technologies of the intellect — speech, gesture, writing and print — as they
    manifest themselves in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. In an exposé of
    the necessary rapprochement between book history and postcolonialism,
    Fraser counters the evolutionary telos of western print triumphalism, chal-
    lenges alphabetic literacy as the universal litmus test registering the impact of
    writing systems and print technologies, and disputes an undifferentiated
    approach to the history of the non-western book. He argues that commu-
    nication forms are multivalent, mutually constitutive, opportunistic and
    deeply implicated in their resistance to or adaptation of local cultural expres-
     sions. Whereas in South Asia ‘the challenges facing print culture were the
     result of script complexity and diversification, in sub-Saharan Africa they
    were, to some extent at least, products of an orthography gap ... In one,
    speech gives way to a lengthy period dominated by script, leading eventually
     to the inception of print. In the other, oral communication gives directly onto
     print, with writing appearing principally as an intermediate, instructional
    mode’.’? He also examines the adaptation of a wide range of classical and
    contemporary literary works from the Ramayama and Mahabharata to the
    works of Tagore, Ngugi wa Thiong’o and Ayi Kwei Armah as well as the role
    of the literary police force: those scholars, editors and censors who exercise
     their powers to delimit the motility of communication forms. Finally, in a
    parting gesture to the world wide web, the ubiquity of mobile technologies
    and the enduring if transformed age of the book, Fraser questions whether
    ‘such confusing hierarchies of empire and post-empire retain any comprehen-
     sible, or barely relevant, meaning’.*°
     The mobility of books and the logic of empire are visible in the lives of
     individuals, such as the nineteenth-century book agent, Edward Petherick,
    who managed the London office of the Melbourne-based publisher and
    bookseller, George Robertson.** Petherick was instrumental in harnessing
    the potential of new transport and communication technologies (such as the
    steamship, the Suez Canal and the transcontinental railway, as well as the
     transatlantic, transpacific and overland telegraph cable services) to create an
    international book trade network that ensured readers in the Australian
    colonies could receive any book from anywhere on the globe at the right

 and southern hemispheres. Petherick, however, understood their necessary
 social dimension. He conceived of the book trade world as a suite of
 connected ante-rooms populated by authors, publishers and booksellers
 who mingled and mixed, exchanging ideas and commodities that ensured
 the international circulation of books and print. Alison Rukavina has
 conceptualized these social networks as a series of fluid and elastic intercon-
 nections between agents — the producers and consumers of books — that are
 non-hierarchical, decentred and multidirectional. As such, ‘books deterritor-
 ialize the world and the world reterritorializes books as they move through
 networks’.**
  In order to understand the book without borders, book historians have
 increasingly looked beyond the nation state as the unit of analysis and beyond
 the notions of national exceptionalism that drove the proliferation of large-
 scale national book history projects. Many scholars investigating the circula-
 tion of objects and ideas across multiple sites of production, dissemination
 and reception have turned to new imperial history and postcolonial studies to
 challenge the distinction and hierarchy implicit in the spatial binaries of
 centre/periphery or metropole/colony, or to understand the role of print in
 the construction and deconstruction of race, gender, religion and class. Other
 scholars are interested in notions of a public sphere linked to the circulation
 and self-reflexivity of texts on a broader, more global scale than that proposed
 by Benedict Anderson whose concepts of imagined communities and print
 capitalism were originally tied to the formation of nation states.*? The emer-
 gence of alternative frameworks (such as the transnational, the postnational
 and the translocal) are a salutary reminder that the essential characteristic
 of books is their mobility.** As the Palgrave Dictionary of Transnational
 History points out, the study of world history is based on the ‘transnational
 connections and circulations, by people, goods, capital, ideas and tastes that
 are not always confined to any particular country or region of the world, nor
 are identifiable with states or governments’.*>
  The recent discourse around transnational and, indeed, international
 approaches in general has resulted in some quite compelling thinking about
 the always already embeddness of the transnational or ‘elsewhereness’ in the
 nation.” Studies of the print-mediated Scottish diaspora, of the development
 of Australian literature in a colonized [market, ] [of ][the ] [Oxford ] [University ] [Press ]

 awareness of the interlocked empires [of ][print ][and ][empires ] [of ][the ][mind.*” ] [And ]

     books, technologies and people; how can we link and incorporate the indivi-
     dual case studies that have characterized much of book history scholarship to
     date within a larger historical narrative?**
              Building a new model for book history
     To help answer these questions, several perspectives are apposite: histoire
     croisée, new imperial histories, translocality and biography. Since 2002,
     Michael Werner and Bénédicte Zimmermann have advocated for a new
     model of history comprising empirical intercrossings, pragmatic induction
     and self-reflexivity, one that moves us beyond comparative history and
     transfer studies, into related modalities such as connected, shared or
     entangled history.*? They argue that comparative history fixes the objects
     of study in synchronic relation to each other at the expense of the meth-
     odological asymmetries of analytic categories or nuances of historic speci-
     ficity. Transfer studies assume a teleological, diachronic model of diffusion
     and adoption that ‘studies the processes of transformation’, but rarely
     engage with reciprocity or return. Werner and Zimmermann suggest that
     histoire croisée provides an opening to ‘examine the links between various
     historically constituted formations’ at the same time as those labile forma-
     tions are interrogated by a researcher whose own subject position is
    acknowledged and examined. The concept of intersection is at the heart
     of a dynamic, multidimensional structure that deals with intercrossings of
     relationships, interactions, circulation, effects, repercussions, resistances,
     inertias and modifications.
      The models underpinning the new imperial historiography are similar
     to the structure envisioned by histoire croisée, which similarly creates a
     nodal point, a clustering of interest and a density of relevance. In reviewing
     the revisionist historiography of empire, Tony Ballantyne has identified three
     interlocked approaches: ‘the importance of knowledge production in the
     constitution of colonial difference; the centrality of cultural difference,
     whether gender, religion, or race, that shaped imperial cultural formations;
     and the concept of the web or network which displaces the binary of metro-
     pole/periphery and imagines the empire as a set of shifting, uneven, and often
     unstable inter-regional and global connections’.>° Put another way, ‘empire is
    now treated as an intellectually integrated zone in which developments are
     simultaneously shaped from different points in the imperial world’.4’ A fresh
     understanding of the kinetic nature of such spaces and places has led to a new
     appreciation of what have variously been termed ‘meeting-up places’, ‘con-

 empire, so too do translocal historians consider that ‘locality is “produced”
 socially and culturally, often in contexts of heightened mobility ... and of
 transgression of boundaries’. Translocality has been proposed as both a tool
 for describing ‘empirical phenomena that result from a multitude of circula-
 tions and transfers’ and a research perspective to ‘better understand and
 conceptualise connections beyond the local which are, however, neither
 necessarily global in scale nor necessarily connected to global moments’.
 Acknowledging the value of a histoire croisée approach and positioning
 translocality along a continuum that includes transnationalism and global-
 ization, German scholars Ulrike Frietag and Achim von Oppen suggest that
 translocality enables different nuances, ‘highlighting the fact that the interac-
 tions and connections between places, institutions, actors and concepts have
 far more diverse, and often even contradictory effects than is commonly
 assumed’.??
  The three concepts of histoire croisée, new imperial histories and trans-
 locality foreground space, mobility and historiographical self-reflexivity but
 they also all wrestle with issues of scale and agency. Werner and Zimmermann
 emphasize that ‘empirical objects relate to several scales at the same time’,
 scales that are spatial as well as temporal, coextensive as well as codetermi-
 nant, products of the mutually constituted relationship between the objects of
 study and the observers’ analytic frameworks. Both the translocal and the
 transnational scales illustrate this double logic:
  Within a histoire croisée perspective, the transnational cannot simply be con-
   sidered as a supplementary level of analysis to be added to the local, regional,
  and national levels according to a logic of change in focus. On the contrary, it is
  apprehended as a level that exists in interaction with the others, producing its
  own logics with feedback effects upon other space-structuring logics. Far from
  being limited to a macroscopic reduction, the study of the transnational level
   reveals a network of dynamic interrelations whose components are in part
  defined through the links they maintain among themselves and the articulations
  structuring their positions.**
 Such a dynamic process goes beyond a simplistic differentiation between
 macro- and microhistorical. Similarly, translocality encourages what Jacques
 Revel calls the ‘systematic linking of different scales, both at the level of
 observation and at that of analysis. [This ] [“game ] [of ][scales” ] [also ] [permits ] [us ] [to ]
 see the “local” and “global” [not ] [as ] [two ] [differing ] [poles ] [but ] [rather ] [as ] [the ]
 intersection of connections and [horizons ] [of ] [action ] [and ] [perspective ] [of ] [very ]
 different reaches’.?5 In other words, [‘“translocal” ] [is ][one ] [attempt ] [to ] [rematerial- ]

```
     space, but to insist ... that the global is already an act of positioning,
     used, if not designed, as a “signifier of difference”’.>°
     Human agency, or biography, is the fourth perspective to add to the mix. If
     both histoire croisée and translocality conceive of space as shifting layers of
     connectedness, the proponents of a biographical perspective also recognize
     the importance of tracking individual mobile agents through this arena of
     multisitedness. Perhaps the most eloquent expression of the role of human
     agency in this regard comes through two intersecting planes: David Lambert
     and Alan Lester’s work on imperial careering and imagined geographies, in
     conjunction with Antoinette Burton and Tony Ballantyne’s examination of
     gender and ‘the dialogic relationship between space and body’.*” These
     scholars recuperate life-writing and biography for the new millennium. As
     Ballantyne notes elsewhere, ‘thinking through life histories is a powerful way
     of reconstructing imperial webs or networks and recovering the role of these
     connections in the making and remaking of imperial culture’.3* Discounting
     the ‘myth of personal coherence’, Lambert and Lester explore a new ‘mobile
     and decentred biographical approach’ that maps neatly onto a ‘networked
     spatial imagination’ of empire. Informed by the work of James Clifford, ‘life
     geography’ becomes a ‘narrative of transindividual occasions’ in which ‘indi-
     viduals become meeting points for influences, no longer static but mobile,
     effusive, decentred, a process not a thing’.*? Like books that travel and
     transform, so do human lives move through time and space, connecting and
     interconnecting people and events.
           Modeling situated knowledges in book history
     The convergence of histoire croisée, new imperial history, translocality and
     biography empowers book historians to think differently about our units of
     analysis, to account for a more nuanced picture appropriate to our field of
     study, and to introduce a measure of critical self-reflection that gets us closer
     to Eva Hemmungs Wirtén’s call for a new kind of research that ‘questions old
     truths regarding method and theory as well as the basic requirement of the
     nation state as our given investigative point of departure’.*° If books are
     promiscuous and have no borders, how can we begin to theorize their func-
     tion in society and culture?
      Over the last thirty years, book historians have turned to models based on
     the classic electrical circuit to understand the production, dissemination and
     reception of books. Robert Darnton’s ‘Communication Circuit’ from 1982
     foregrounds the various historical actors involved at each step of the book
     trade process, from authors and publishers to paper suppliers and pressmen,

```

```
       social, intellectual and political contexts in which these agents
 Operate are positioned in the centre of the model and their influences are
 considered ubiquitous. ‘A New Model for the Study of the Book’ dating from
 1993, by bibliographers Thomas Adams and Nicolas Barker, concentrates
 on functions rather than agents and invokes a life-cycle of the book that
 begins with publication (significantly omitting authorship), moves through
 manufacture and distribution to reception, and closes the circuit with
 survival. Again, the contexts are pervasive, but now visualized as ‘the whole
 socio-economic conjuncture’ surrounding the circuit. Two other, non-
 diagrammatized concepts of book history have emerged more recently. In
 1997, literary critic Peter D. McDonald invoked Pierre Bourdieu’s notion of
 fields of cultural production, both restricted and non-restricted, to create a
 three-dimensional Darnton in which the reconstruction of the ‘predicament’
 of the book and the radically situated nature of its text is the necessary first
 step towards engagement and interpretation. In 2000, the historian of science
 James Secord used the analogy of a dividing amoeba and coined the phrase
 ‘literary replication’ to explain how texts and ideas can permeate society
 through reading, writing and talking networks. Such networks do not rely
 exclusively upon people having read the actual book(s) in question, but rather
 epitomise cultural formation in action.**
  The field of publishing studies offers additional perspectives of interest to
 the book historian. The traditional publishing value chain is a linear render-
 ing of the core book production functions, from concept to consumer, with
 each agent in the process adding significant value. More recently, South
 African scholar Elizabeth Le Roux has incorporated models from political
 sociology in order to understand the role of university presses under the
 apartheid regime.** By introducing a six-point spectrum from resistance to
 complicity, she has inserted Bourdieu’s ‘fields’ directly into the value chain
 and conceptualized the politicization of the publishing industry as a contin-
 uum, thereby nuancing our understanding of the complexities of the
 industry. With paradigms shifting in the digital domain and contemporary
 publishers increasingly bypassing retailers in favour of targeting readers
 directly, the value chain is currently being reconfigured as a value network,
 a model more suited to the world of open access and e-publishing.
  The agents involved in production, dissemination, reception and survival of
 books, the processes themselves, the fields of cultural production that situate
 books and readers and the ways in which books replicate themselves, have all
 been the subject of significant monographs. [However, ] [none ] [of ][these ] [approaches ]
 engages either explicitly or implicitly [with ] [the ][inherent ] [mobility ] [and ] [mutability ]

      (see Figure 4.1). An examination of the complex, dynamic intercrossings
     between people (prosopography), places (placeography) and objects (biblio-
     graphy) offers a quite different way of conceptualizing the ways and means by
     which books travel and transform through space and across time. Various
     nodes of intersection between adjacent elements suggest rich veins of contextual
     research, whether the life geographies of individual actors, the object biogra-
     phies or ‘it-narratives’ of individual books and texts, or the politics of the
     archival spaces in which material records are deposited, described and discov-
     ered.*? The three primary elements converge in a zone of investigation termed
     the event horizon. Adapted from general relativity and quantum mechanics,
      this multidimensional contact zone situates the book’s historical research pro-
      cess as one of constant, energetic interplay between people, places and things.

 the research questions, the researcher’s perspectives and the available evidence,
 the research activity may bend towards one particular element’s event horizon
 more than another. However, the pull of the other elements balances the
 possibility of the researcher being captured by the potential black hole of a
 single domain. Such a model acknowledges the spatial turn in history in which
 space, place, site and location are critical factors shaping our understanding of
 the agency of material forms. It also moves us away from the current disciplin-
 ary orientation of book history being narrowly focused on literary criticism,
 history or bibliography, to a more comprehensive understanding of the inter-
 disciplinarity that enables our field of study.
  If this chapter began with the nineteenth-century movement of a Bengali
 songbook from India to the Australian outback, it concludes with a quite
 different, contemporary exemplar of situated knowledges. In 2001, Ron
 Hornbaker launched BookCrossing.com with the by-line ‘If you love your
 books, let them go’. This social media and networking space encourages
 readers to read, register and release their books for others to enjoy.
 Whether on a train, in an aeroplane seat pocket or on a park bench, these
 modern-day messages in a bottle can be left and found. Their journeys are
 tracked through unique identifiers (BCIDs) glued onto endpapers, checked
 via their online mapping feature, or hunted down through titles registered on
 the website. Readers log their reading experiences, review books, establish
 communities called official book crossing zones (OBCZ), engage in random
 acts of BookCrossing kindness (RABCK), and contribute to the world’s
 largest mobile library. ‘Using books as the architecture and glue to facilitate
 the Great Conversation, there are currently 1,558,761 BookCrossers and
 9,469,064 books travelling throughout 132 countries. Our community is
 changing the world and touching lives one book at a time’.*#
  The printer, inventor, library founder and politician Benjamin Franklin
 once said that ‘All mankind is divided into three classes: those that are
 immovable, those that are movable, and those that move’. If people move
 and frisky bibliographic objects travel and transform, we should also recog-
 nize that spaces and places are fundamentally kinetic, articulating, sustaining
 and repositioning subjects and objects in an enduring engagement with
 cultural formation, reformation and deformation.**

     Materials and meanings
 Nature originally provided the surfaces, writing tools and media for any
 human communication that sought permanence, or at least presence beyond
 speech. Worldwide, the stone walls of caves, cliffs and boulders offered
 readily available means for attaching messages, some of which famously
 survive today in the form of the Lascaux caves in southern France and the
 pictographs of indigenous communities in the Americas. While stone itself
 offered a long-lasting surface — not only hardy but heavy as well — not all
 writing instruments and methods of inscription did. Increasingly exposed to
 light and human respiration, the dyed images in the Lascaux caves are now in
 danger of fading rapidly, and who knows what human messages, applied to
 exterior stones and with weaker tints and liquids, disappeared thousands of
 years ago due to nature’s forces of erasure? Of the messages intended for
 impermanent inscription on such surfaces as sand, deliberately erasable, we
 know even less. We know relatively little about leaves, bark or wood, beyond
 the fact that they provided writing surfaces — few examples survive, yet they
 were used by peoples around the world for millennia. The materials of
 thousands of years ago were often robust, or heavy, or ubiquitous, but the
 marks made on them were usually mere molecules in thickness and are
 consequently lost to us.
  Yet some examples do survive that reveal how for millennia indigenous
 peoples carved messages into stone surfaces (petroglyphs), painted on them
 (pictographs) and painted on or carved into bark and trees and other natural
 surfaces. These writing or ideographic systems were integrated with the
 immediate natural settings, the cosmologies and the oral traditions of their
 indigenous tribes. Instead of separate graphic systems such as alphabets, these
 forms of communication had meaning by virtue of their relationship with oral
 teachings, referencing shared ecological or spiritual or astronomical under-
 standing. Surviving examples of American indigenous petroglyphs and

    harmony or conflict, interactions with the spirit world, ceremonies and con-
     tracts. Ideographic messages also existed on smaller, more portable surfaces
    such as the North American Mi’kmaq wampum, a woven belt of coloured
     shells communicating events of historical or ceremonial significance, treaty
    agreements or spiritual knowledge.’
     Experimenting continues today with writing surfaces and materials that
     are permanent, flexible, accessible, readable, transportable and affordable.
    Versions of that combination have been sought for millennia, since the desire
     for inscribing communication outside of speech emerged. Each gradually
    evolving solution to that challenge helped determine the societies and civiliza-
     tions that produced them, the book being one of the most successful.
     The permanence of Egyptian stone hieroglyphics has instantiated their
    messages of power and the after-life, remaining to this day as the most
    enduring of inscriptions. Even with other means now at our disposal with
    which to secure the longevity of a message, we often still turn to the stone
    surface — when dedicating a prominent building or recognizing people or
     events in public spaces — to lend weight to the statement. Laws were inscribed
     in stone as were, and are, epitaphs. Any message that deserved protection
    from wanton change or destruction and to be understood for a long time
    merited capture in stone. Messages, too, whose meaning was inextricable
    from their location — pyramids near a river basin where many people gath-
     ered, caves and cliffs by animal migratory routes or other geographical
     attractions — were well served by the permanence of stone. Not surprisingly,
     the message and its medium reinforced each other. These forms of writing are
     not merely the most long-lasting we know of. They also shared an assumption
     that their purpose would be unchanging: the Egyptian after-life would always
    contain a 49-day interim period, buffalo would always pass by near southern

     Not all writing was motivated by the desire for permanence of message and
     material, or by location — those are merely the examples that, for those reasons,
    have survived for us to know them. We know Sumerians from the fourth
    millennium BCE used soft clay tablets that were erasable, reusable and
    portable — pretty well opposite to everything stone represented. Too, clay
     tablets required neither the labour-intensive dyes nor the rarer chiselling exper-
     tise required for communication by stone. Clay was not the Sumerians’ material
    of choice so much as the material available and accessible to them. Its properties
    enabled a more private and transitory inscription and, if Sumerian advances in
    thought are any indication, apparently incentivized numeracy and literacy. Wet
     clay’s flexible surface encouraged and enabled the development of cuneiform
     script, originally logographic and restricted in use but eventually syllabic and

                        of of clay tablet texts
 remain, excavated from vast systematized early libraries in Babylonia. The texts
 were not always flat and ‘tablet’-like — formal documents are to be found on
 many-sided clay cylinders that once stood conveniently, accessibly and alpha-
  betically ordered, on archival shelves. Though often meant to be an imperma-
 nent surface, some clay tablets were heated during invaders’ fires and hardened
  for us still to see, unintentionally maintaining the daily thoughts and reflections
 of people targeted for destruction.
  Not all surfaces intended for casual use by other societies and civilizations
 have met with the same serendipitous fate. We know bone and tortoiseshell
 were used in China from the eighteenth to the twelfth centuries BCE but few
 of the actual texts remain. Silk, too, was a writing surface in China, and
 increasingly popular by the first centuries CE, but it was expensive and, like
 bone and shell, intolerant of human writing error. Wood was used, at least by
 the Egyptians, earlier than that. Leaves were used by many peoples through-
 out Asia from at least the tenth century BCE to the nineteenth century CE.
 A popular technique involved palm leaves, cut lengthwise and inscribed with
  a sharp implement and dyed to give the text a visual contrast. The leaves were
 sewn together with lengths of twine through holes near each end, and held
 together with a stiff wood cover at the top and the bottom. The resulting palm
  leaf book usually contained sutras or aphorisms; the term elided the contents
 with the form of the object itself — it is derived from the root siv whence come
 the English words ‘sew’ and ‘suture’. The perishable nature of the palm leaf
 material beyond a few centuries has meant that only a small number of the
 originals survive, though restoration efforts and digitization projects are now
  prolific. Bark, more durable particularly when varnished to highlight the text,
 was used until at least the sixteenth century CE in central America. Animal
 skins supplied writing surfaces for some three millennia after the Egyptians
 used them. Originally capable of inscription on only one side, and extremely
 labour-intensive to preserve in order to prevent swift natural decay, skins
 were nonetheless ubiquitous. Attempts to render them into an efficient writ-
 ing surface would continue until the invention of what came to be called
 parchment solved the challenge in second century BCE Greece.
  Standing alongside these two evolutionary stages of writing surfaces were
 papyrus and the wax tablet. Papyrus dominated the writing surface market in
 Egypt and the Mediterranean for centuries if not millennia until it was super-
 seded by parchment. Papyrus was used for many purposes besides writing,
 such as the hulls of boats — important for a river culture — for baskets and
 for clothing. Papyrus was made from the stem of a plant readily available

     lightweight, thin and flexible mat. Its availability, relatively simple produc-
     tion requirements and longevity, combined with its portability and its ability
     to retain inks and to be legible, accounted for its popularity. It is perhaps not
     overstating the case to say that papyrus provided the surface upon which all
    Mediterranean civilizations at one time or another recorded themselves and
    evolved their thinking. Given the fibrous quality of the plant stem, papyrus
    was difficult to fold, and usually only one side was smooth enough to write
    upon. So papyrus was rolled into a scroll, which kept it intact for long
     periods. To solve the challenge of how to enable the eye to scan the papyrus
     scroll’s otherwise long lines of letters, its text was arranged in vertical rectan-
     gular shapes of shorter lines called paginae, an early precursor of the page.
     Although papyrus supplied the main writing surface in the Mediterranean
     basin for millennia, it was nevertheless a restricting medium. For one thing, its
     surface was rough and not easy to apply pigments to. For another, it was
     fragile, particularly susceptible to deterioration and unable to endure distri-
     bution through Europe’s different climates. Too, its popularity — coupled with
     the Library of Alexandria’s mission to copy all knowledge onto scrolls made
     of it — brought the plant itself to the brink of extinction by the second century
    CE, in the process driving up cost. Perhaps most importantly, it did not
     tolerate corrections well, nor could it be reused. Papyrus was able to provide
     a relatively formal vehicle for a finished writing product, but it was not
    conducive to the more transitory, but no less crucial, process of learning the
     skill of writing. And while it promoted the archiving of resolved thought and
    accomplished events, it was not quite adaptable enough to provide a wide-
    spread means of experimenting with provisional thinking and expression.
     Those requirements were better met by the wax tablet, an innovative
     attempt to combine flexibility of use, portability, affordability and availabil-
     ity of material. It served a different purpose than the permanence of fired clay
     or of stone, and of papyrus. The wax tablet was made of a wooden frame into
    which a black wax was embedded that could be inscribed with one end of a
     stylus — metal-tipped and sharp — and erased with the broad opposite end.
    Probably originating in Assyria around the eighth century BCE, it swiftly
    gained popularity with Greeks and Romans, whose efficient alphabets and
     high literacy rates required a technology that sustained writing acquisition
    and use. And suitably framed in wood, wax tablets could be bound together
     with leather laces, as the Romans did — an early form of the book or ‘codex’
     (the Latin word for a piece of wood) — to simplify the otherwise cumbersome
     access to specific paginae in the interior sections of the papyrus scroll.
     The scroll’s benefit, however, was the extended text it permitted (one

 recorded history. scrolls were rolled a single central stick
 and had to be read by unfurling it in the one direction. The Jewish Torah has
 two wooden rollers (atzei chaim), one at either end, and could be more
 efficiently unrolled from either direction. The Greeks folded some scrolls in
 a pleated fashion, as did the Maya with their codices written on durable bark
 beginning around the fifth century CE. However structured, the scroll’s
 potentially enormous yet storable length could contain the needs of a pro-
 tracted narrative, of complex astronomical observations, of treatises and of
 encyclopedic social records and financial transactions. It was also relatively
 portable. Those architectural attributes were not about to be allowed to
 disappear due to the vagaries of papyrus. The scroll, that is, offered benefits
 too significant to lose, and if the properties of papyrus made it too fragile, if its
 scarcity and price had become issues, and if its geography was too localized
 for the expanding world of literacy and writing to sustain the technology of
 the scroll, some other material would have to take papyrus’s place.
  That material was animal skin, the other widely available surface whose
 provenance extended beyond the Nile basin (though not, for the potential
 purpose of writing, to Hindu cultures revering animal flesh). Like papyrus,
 animal skins were used for many purposes besides writing on — primarily
 clothing and building — and they were easily procured, if not so easily refined
 for inscription. Experiments with turning the familiar animal skin into a
 writing surface had been undertaken for millennia, and fragments of
 Egyptian texts still exist that were written on animal skin as early as the
 third millennium. Assyrian and Babylonian texts were sometimes written on
 animal skin as well, concurrently with the broader use of clay tablets and
 papyrus, from the sixth century BCE, and Greek texts on animal skin date
 from at least the fifth century BCE. But for most of that time, animal skin
 supplied a writing surface as compromised as papyrus — one-sided, rough,
 prone to disintegration and resistant to correcting and reuse, while requiring
 greater effort and expense than papyrus to create.
  Improvements to the product occurred in Pergamon in the second century
 BCE, however, that remedied some of these weaknesses at the same time that
 papyrus was dwindling in supply and increasing in cost. Those improvements
 included tanning and liming to make the surface durable and foldable,
 scraping and dehairing to render it smooth and two-sided and stretching to
 render it very thin. Its thin, two-sided and foldable features essentially estab-
 lished the concept of the leaf and, influenced by the scroll’s paginae, pages —

     rabbits, goats, even unborn calves — were not found only in one region, as
     papyrus was, but everywhere the Roman empire extended.
      The result was the most enduring and versatile writing surface invented
     prior to paper, and in some ways even after. Parchment from centuries ago
     exists in many libraries, some of it looking as if it were created yesterday. Easy
      to produce it was not, but its benefits would outweigh its arduous production
     process for well over a millennium and would make the popularity and
     influence of the book itself possible. Parchment’s first use was as a writing
     surface for scrolls — large portions of the Dead Sea Scrolls are a famous
     example. But the period of parchment’s ascendancy as a writing surface of
     choice was roughly simultaneous with that of the codex — identified by some
      as occurring in Rome in the first century CE, and others as being in Egypt or
     other northern African regions prior to that.* Although the book’s pages
     could conceivably be made from material other than parchment — Egyptian
     papyrus codices survive from the fourth century BCE — parchment’s unique
     qualities would provide the conditions necessary for the book to thrive.
      For that to happen, though, a suitable process for accomplishing the many
     tasks involved in creating the parchment surface was required. Up to roughly
     the end of the medieval period, monasteries invented and practised an
     assembly-line system that effectively did just that, motivated by the desire to
     replicate and circulate not just books but the book, the Bible. Self-sufficient
     communities, monasteries carried out their own animal husbandry, vegetable
     gardening and mineral acquisition that provided them with animals, inks and
     dyes — the raw materials of book production. Combined with the intellectual
     raw material of Latin literacy and Carolingian script, monasteries controlled
     the making, selling, reading and circulation of books — essentially the entire
     European market — for the better part of a millennium.
      Each stage of the monastic book production process required its own types of
     expertise. Sheep skins, for instance, were transformed into parchment through
     the laborious processes of liming, curing, dehairing, scraping and smoothing.
     They were also strategically cut to maximize the available surface area to
     produce as many leaves as possible - a complex geometric challenge. The
     resulting leaves, usually octavos, were passed to others for the addition of
     pencilled margins and lines. Lines were drawn from side to side, guided by a
     column of equally spaced small holes down the side margins made by a rolled
     pinwheel. The relative dimensions of margins were determined by various
     factors, and often by the golden mean or sectio divina. Examining a medieval
     page one can frequently see a height/width ratio of the text (not the page itself
     but the margined text within it) that approximates 1.618 (phi) or the ratio of

 end (our word ‘pen-knife’ has its ancestry there) and lightly scraping errors from
 the parchment. To prevent inadvertent rubbing during composition, spaces
 were measured prior to the scribe’s work for the later addition of any illumi-
 nated initials in gold leaf or tints evolved from precious metals. By the seventh to
 twelfth centuries, book covers were made of wood or heavier leather to keep the
 parchment pages from swelling with humidity. Clasps were often used on the
 outer front edges of the covers to assist in keeping pages flat. Spines evolved
 from being stab-sewn, capable of accommodating a single sheet folded to forma
 signature, to a chain-link system that could accommodate multiple separate
 signatures. (Stab-sewn bindings are stitched together near the binding edge,
 whereas chain-stitched bindings allow groups of signatures to be sewn together
 through the fold.)
  Add to these stages the arduous act of writing itself, often in cold and
 poorly lit scriptoria, and it is clear the entire activity of book-production was
 extremely labour-intensive. A single page prepared for the scriptorium could
 take a day or more just to inscribe, barring errors or other delays, tiring the
 body, mind and eyes. Some scripts are as small as one-sixteenth of an inch
 high, too small to be easily read with the unaided eye, suggesting the devotion
 was not in the act of reading but the act of the inscription into the parchment
 surface itself — literally making the word flesh. Digital enlargements of such
 scripts reveal an astonishing accuracy in the straightness of line, the height
 of script, and the shape and detail of individual letters.4 One can imagine
 young scribes possessing a myopia ideally suited for the difficult purpose of
 repeatedly producing minute script, and gradually losing their ability — likely
 their sight altogether — much as today’s high-performing athletes have rela-
 tively brief spans of prowess.
  The monastery process was efficient enough to allow the production of an
 enormous number of books and thus their spread and influence throughout
 Europe until the invention of printing with moveable type in the mid-fifteenth
 century. The desired feature of portability, and the longevity of parchment
 and sophisticated inks, combined to make the book a formidable commu-
 nication device. The assembly-line process and chain-link binding structure
 also meant that sections of a book — called ‘peciae’ — could be re-sequenced,
 inserted, extracted, edited or omitted altogether (the ‘pecia system’), thus
 introducing a flexibility in the concept of the bible’s canonical contents
 impossible for its predecessor, the scroll. This particular feature was crucial

     Testament were not decreed by the Catholic Church until the Council of
     Trent in 1546, and even later by the Church of England. The flexibility in
     content allowed by the pecia system played an enormous role in the evolution
     of the Bible’s canon. As the scholar-librarian Christopher De Hamel observes
     ‘the Bible is not a single narrative but a series of often unconnected or loosely
     associated groups of short books. Those familiar with the text will know that
     even an exact definition of these individual components is not always easy’.*
      The fact that the physical structure of the book permitted a flexibility of
     content had other far-reaching consequences as well. If the book could be a
     vessel capable of absorbing the evolving contents of the Bible, it could absorb
      all kinds of changing contents — and on demand. Monasteries took advantage
     of this by producing Books of Hours and other book genres tailored to the
     devotional preferences of private buyers. The market took advantage of this
     by turning bookmaking into a business enterprise that could respond to
     wealthy individuals’ reading needs, and to the instructional needs of emerging
     universities. With the Renaissance and the rise of humanism came an
     increased demand for content that the flexible book could accommodate,
     indeed could drive.
      Several technical challenges compromised the book’s ability to achieve its
     potential in this regard, however. Of its many labour-intensive and costly
     features, the process of creating the parchment page was one of the most
      critical. The procedure for producing paper, invented in China roughly
     simultaneously with the emergence of the codex in the Mediterranean basin,
     reached Europe in the thirteenth century. It involved reducing cloth fibre to a
     watery pulp that could then be dried and stretched and thinned and bleached —
     slightly less laborious than the creation of parchment, but no longer reliant on
     animal husbandry, about one-tenth the cost of parchment, one-quarter its
     thickness and, crucially, capable of accepting ink more accurately.
      The other part of book production that required so much labour was the
     process of inscription itself. Manual, time-consuming, physically demanding
     and inefficient, it meant a many-to-one, human-to-book ratio of effort.
     Gutenberg is widely acknowledged as the one who reversed that ratio, invent-
     ing a press that could produce many identical copies of a single text through
     the efficient reduction of duplicated tasks. Possibly others had the same idea.
    What turned the idea into a reality, though, was a combination of emerging
     technologies. Paper — cheap, thin and ink-friendly - was one. But Gutenberg
     himself crucially invented two others. One was new viscous printers’ inks
     made from ‘lampblack’ (flame soot and varnish) that were darker, more
     permanent and more paper-ready than their water-based and vellum-specific

 metals, was his invention of new metal for type, combining lead, tin and
 antimony to produce ‘speculum’; it separated evenly from the mold into
 which its liquid state had been poured to make the letter type, and when
 solid it took and released the new inks efficiently. And of course — more
 conceptual than technological - was the inspired breakthrough that saw
 letters as individual, moveable objects, capable of reuse and repositioning.
 In Walter Ong’s words, ‘alphabet letterpress printing, in which each letter
 was Cast on a separate piece of metal, or type, marked a psychological break-
 through of the first order ... It embedded the word itself deeply in the
 manufacturing process and made it into a kind of commodity’ — something
 to be produced, sold, purchased and consumed.®
  As with many transformative inventions, Gutenberg’s printing press was
 inspired by familiar objects — in this case, olive and grape presses — and
 envisioned for a new purpose. Much was inspired by scriptorium precedent
 as well. The printing press process borrowed the manuscript’s assembly-line
 sequence of people and tasks, replacing rulers and scribes and initialers with
 typecasters who cut type, printers who designed the page and the book,
 compositors who set the type in place, cutters who made woodblock prints
 for illustrations and initials, and pressmen who worked the press itself.
 Gutenberg began cutting type for the first printed Bible in 1449, composition
 of the pages began in 1452 and the printing of approximately one hundred
 42-line Bibles was completed in 1456. Gutenberg printed his first thirty Bibles
 on parchment at a rate of 170 sheep per Bible; the one hundred Bibles he then
 printed on paper would have required, had they been on parchment, over
 15,000 animals.
  The intellectual and social and political consequences of the printing press
 are the subject of much debate. The nature of those consequences is attended
 to in the other chapters in this section. The transformative scale of those
 consequences cannot be questioned, however. Books became cheaper and
 easier and faster to produce, and as a result the numbers of copies of books,
 and of original texts to be copied, grew exponentially. Print was easier to read
 than cursive script, enabling more efficient silent reading. The pace of both the
 production of books (printing and selling) and their consumption (buying and
 reading) increased, leading to a self-perpetuating dynamic of greater literacy
 rates, greater demand and a greater ability to meet it. A book off the printing
 press consisted of paper pages that were relatively long-lasting, print that was
 clear, a physical structure that permitted varied contents, an efficiently trans-

     printing press was so prolific, its technologies so transformative and efficient,
     that its fundamentals — a wooden hand-powered press, cloth-fibre paper
     produced in large sheets, new inks and metal types, an assembly-line produc-
     tion reminiscent of the scriptorium’s — experienced only incremental change
     for almost three centuries.
      Refinements would occur nonetheless and, not surprisingly, to the place of
     inscription itself, the paper page. Cloth-fibre paper sufficed, but it became
     increasingly costly because the raw materials — linens and rags — were them-
     selves hand-made and, by the early eighteenth century, in short supply.
     Nature had always been making its own thin, light and very strong paper,
     though, by masticating wood fibre into pulp in the mandibles of the ‘paper
     wasp’ (polistinae). The French multidisciplinary scientist René de Réaumur
     recorded his observation of the wasp making its nest, and the potential impact
     for human papermaking, in a 1719 treatise. Wasps, he wrote,
       form very fine paper, like ours; they extract the fibres of common wood of the
       countries where they live. They teach us that paper can be made from the fibres
       of plants without the use of rags and linen ... If we had woods similar to those
       used by the American wasps for their paper, we could make the whitest paper,
        for this material is very white. By a further beating and breaking of the fibres
        that the wasps make and using the thin paste that comes from them, the very fine
       paper may be composed. This study should not be neglected, for it is, I dare say,
       important. The rags from which we make our paper are not an economical
       material and every paper-maker knows that this substance is becoming rare.
       While the consumption of paper increases every day, the production of linen
       remains about the same. In addition to this the foreign mills draw upon us for
       material. The wasp seems to teach us a means of overcoming these difficulties.”
     Paper from wood pulp would prove, after refinements to the process by the end
     of the nineteenth century, to be whiter, thinner, better at absorbing ink, more
      legible, cheaper and made of more readily available raw materials, than cloth-
      fibre paper. It would also introduce perhaps the most environmentally destruc-
      tive product of the industrial revolution, for it required access to vast amounts
     of flowing water in the form of rivers that conveniently carried away the
     poisonous chemicals required to break down wood fibre, congeal it into a
     paper-ready paste, purify it and, most damaging, bleach it — lye, hydrogen
     peroxide, chlorine dioxide, acetic acid, sulfur, sodium silicate and chlorine gas.
      Notably, the reason paper was in such high demand, depleting quantities of
     linen and other cloth and causing Réaumur in the early eighteenth century to
     ponder the efficiencies of the wasp, was not books per se — it was newspapers.
     By the time of Gutenberg, the demand for the book required, and produced,

 eighteenth century those technologies were, in turn, used in the service of
 newspaper production — the epitome of relentlessly paced and produced
 book-like efficiencies requiring all the current advances in type metals, inks,
 paper and mass production assembly lines. The material inventiveness that
 had gone into producing the book was, by the eighteenth century, redirected
 toward the purpose of the book’s doppelganger, the newspaper. In return, the
 material and technological innovations that kept the newspaper in step with
 demand indirectly benefited the book and, most significantly, the novel.
  The 1725 invention of the stereotype printing technique was a crucial
 example. For a text of any kind to be set for printing, prior to stereotype,
 each letter had to be set individually in place for each page, and any reprints
 had to repeat the composing process — a time-consuming and costly activity
 when undertaken for a book of novel length. Stereotype involved casting a
 mold for a complete page, releasing the type to be used for other printing
 projects and permitting the mold to be used for as many printings as neces-
 sary. This freed printers from having to guess how many reprints or editions a
 book might require, and meant newspaper printing could occur simulta-
 neously on separate presses, reducing cost while increasing copies and speed
 of production. The consequences of stereotyping for the rise of the novel
 genre are difficult to measure. Guesswork regarding print runs and reprints
 still approaches an art form in publishing houses. In the eighteenth century
 when the novel itself was a new genre of the book and analyses of readership
 markets were centuries away, the many determinants of a novel’s potential
 readership and market were virtually impossible to predict, leaving most
 printers no choice but to estimate conservatively and to spend the money to
 recompose and reissue when demand exceeded expectations. Due to their
 length, novels were costly to produce in the first place, and the average print
 run of 500-750 copies for seventeenth- and early-eighteenth-century novels
 meant a high price for the purchaser, preventing the mass readership the genre
 would later attract. The advent of the stereotype process, however, meant
 printers could reissue a novel on demand at considerably less cost than before.
 And if economies of scale in novel production meant that printers could
 benefit financially from print runs that responded to demand instead of to
 guesswork, it was logical that the best-selling novel would become an attrac-
 tive commodity.
  Other technologies emerged to ensure that happened. Until the beginning

     and of each unbound book to the next. These features impeded the pace of
     book production until the invention, in 1800, of the all-metal press by the
     Englishman Charles Stanhope, who exploited his country’s improvements in
     metal casting to create a single-cast machine frame. Its increased strength and
     weight from the wood press of the day allowed a faster production time. The
     improvements in strength also meant that paper could be run through the
      press at a faster pace, opening the way for the use of continuous roll paper,
     invented by Nicholas-Louis Robert in London two years earlier, and first
     produced by machine there in 1807. Add to these achievements Friedrich
     K6nig’s fast steam-driven press that substantially reduced the need for man-
      ual labour, and the invention in the 1840s of the rotary drum press that pulled
      in continuous roll paper, and a virtually transformed book-printing assembly
      line existed to mass-produce books at an unheard-of pace.
      That assembly line, though, originally served the purposes of the newspaper
      industry, not book printing. The first steam-driven press was built for
     The Times newspaper in London in 1814. But by 1840 the book printing
      trade in England had moved pretty well entirely to the new technology, accom-
     panied by faster and more efficient, though still mostly manual, binding pro-
      cesses. By 1852 du Réaumur’s earlier reflections on the potential for wood-pulp
     paper had caught the attention of the Englishman Hugh Burgess who helped
     design such a process, followed by chemical refinements to it by the American
      C. B. Tilghman in 1867 and the German C. F. Dahl in 1879. Dahl’s contribu-
      tions included developing a process that pulped one of the most ubiquitous tree
      species in North America, the pine tree. Prior to 1750, approximately one
     hundred new titles were published annually in England; by 1825 approximately
     600 annually; by the end of the nineteenth century approximately 6,000. The
      increase in book production was accompanied by drastically reduced costs to
     produce them. Prior to 1800 the cost of paper accounted for over 20 per cent of
      a book’s production cost; by 1900 it accounted for less than 7 per cent.
     American publishing firms such as Beadle and Adams, among others, took
     advantage of the swift technological evolution in printing capacity and the
     equally swift decline in production costs, and sold thousands of novel-length
     publications at a price of ten cents each. One of the first such dime novels, Ann
      S. Stephens’s 1860 Malaeska, sold over 300,000 copies, an enormous leap
     beyond the average 500-750 copies from the previous generation of printing
      press technology. It was followed by a succession of American dime novels such
      as the Buffalo Bill stories by Ned Buntine (aka Edward Judson) and Colonel
      Prentiss Ingraham’s The Woman Trapper or Arkansas Sal and the Apaches -
      one of over 1,000 novels and ‘novelettes’ he wrote.

      said that the physical structure of the book was not changed signifi-
 cantly from the period of monastic book production, but the technology-driven
 relationship among its principle stakeholders — printers, authors and readers —
  as well as what that physical structure could affordably contain, were trans-
 formed. Charles Dickens’s Pickwick Papers remains a good example of all of
  that. Originally published in 1836 by Chapman and Hall in twenty monthly
  one-shilling instalments of 32 pages each, it sold up to 40,000 copies per
  instalment. The audience was not only enormous but, given the very low cost,
 more evenly distributed across income levels than before. A reader could
 purchase all the instalments for less than the complete novel would otherwise
 have cost. As important, it inspired a narrative design that Dickens would
 explore and develop throughout his writing career. The instalments would
  typically culminate at a point in the plot that created reader anticipation and
  thus reader demand, generating a plot and sub-plot motif that would come to
  typify the novel structure. That, in turn, gave Dickens the opportunity to
 develop large casts of characters to drive that structure, and to develop the
 many opportunities a now affordable long novel capacity would provide.
 By 1860, Dickens was selling 100,000 copies of Great Expectations’s weekly
  instalments in his new All the Year Round magazine. It was issued by Chapman
 and Hall in a three-volume set in 1861; five printings appeared in quick
  succession to encourage sales. Almost all of Great Expectations’s first 1,000
  copies were purchased by Mudie’s Select Library and were continuously loaned
  out. (As a result, a set in excellent condition is now hard to find, and can
 command upwards of $125,000.)
   Charles Edward Mudie, like Charles Dickens, was an astute businessman.
  In return for purchasing large quantities of books from a publisher, Mudie
 would pay about half of what the publisher would charge for them on the
 market. He paid 15 shillings per copy for the first printing of Chapman and
  Hall’s edition of Great Expectations, for example, which otherwise sold for
  over 30 shillings. He encouraged publishers to produce three-volume sets so
  that he could effectively supply three times the number of readers with one
 book (three readers could read the same book, at different stages, simulta-
 neously) thereby attracting a larger membership to pay his annual one guinea
  fee. Mudie’s libraries thrived well into the 1860s, after which time their
  influence waned as a result of the 1850 Public Libraries Act in England
 (which gave local communities the power to establish free public libraries).
 But until then, the result was that book prices were set artificially higher than
 most people could afford, ensuring Mudie’s its corner of the subscription
 library market and publishers their bulk sales.*

     Feast (1847, or Preskett Prest’s
     Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street. Mudie regarded such books as
     disreputable and refused to buy them. Ignored by him, made of cheap
     paper, poor bindings and sloppy printing, they were one-thirtieth the price
     of a three-volume Chapman and Hall Great Expectations and thus attracted
    enormous purchasing audiences. Too, by the last three decades of the nine-
     teenth century, the sewing, gathering and covering of books became more
     automated — often called ‘edition binding’ — to keep pace with the automated
     press, and drove prices down even further. One result was that by and large
     the novel came to be regarded as a cheap commodity and, analogously, an
     aesthetically inferior genre of human expression. Henry James was respond-
     ing in part to that view of the novel when he wrote in the 1884 “The Art of
     Fiction’ that ‘the old superstition about fiction being “wicked” has doubtless
     died out in England; but the spirit of it lingers in a certain oblique regard
     directed toward any story which does not more or less admit that it is only a
     joke’. And Mark Twain argued in his 1895 ‘Fenimore Cooper’s Literary
     Offenses’ that novelistic technique needed to be taken more seriously than
     Cooper did, whose work he evidently ranked with that of Prest, Buntine and
     Stephens. Like many inexpensive products of mechanical reproduction, the
     novel’s artistic and monetary values were seen as one and the same; and the
     low production costs coupled with mass production capabilities opened a
     new market for attention-grabbing storytelling over artistic depth.
      Or maybe it is the other way around: the wide currency of the novel, enabled
     by its technologized printing press assembly line, immersed more of the human
     imagination in the world of the book, opening the way for the explosion of
     novelistic experimentation and sophistication in the late nineteenth century
     and thereafter. The newspaper business once again obliged, driving further
     improvements to the printing process that increased speed (by the 1930s news-
     paper printers could produce tens of thousands of papers an hour) while
     reducing costs. Synthetic glues that replaced stitched bindings followed for
     book printers, along with the move from cloth or cardboard covers to thick
     paper covers. Together, these developments encouraged the development of the
    modern paperback. It had emerged in France and Germany in the mid-
     nineteenth century (particularly the Tauchnitz editions) to offer inexpensive
     reprints of popular authors, but in the 1930s it was redeployed by Albatross,
     Penguin, Mercury and others for first editions of such writers as Ernest
    Hemingway, Dorothy L. Sayers, Agatha Christie and Dashiell Hammett. The
     ultimate embodiment of consciously inexpensive and speedy book production,
     the paperback was a response to a massive demand for reading material that
     was otherwise met by newspapers and magazines. Priced to sell at sixpence (in

       and magazines, books from the high- to the low-brow were sud-
 denly available in the form of paperbacks that were easily accessible as well as
 portable, inexpensive and disposable. Their rapid pace of production invited a
 writing production line of its own — formulaic fiction that kept pace with the
 consumption and production of the book, just as the newspaper kept pace with
 constantly changing events. Mysteries, romances, detective fiction, suspense,
  children’s series and horror novels were some results (Albatross and Penguin
 colour-coded their different kinds of series) — impossible to imagine in the
 absence of the book’s updated technologies of production, circulation and
 marketing. So too were encyclopedias, previously so large and compendious
  as to be unaffordable to most individual buyers since their eighteenth-century
  inception. With them, in fact, emerged the phenomenon of affordable access to
 reasonably portable archived information. Readers no longer had to move to
 where the information was — they could access it in their homes. In fact, they
  didn’t even have to leave their homes to purchase it because salesmen brought it
  right to their door.
  By the early twentieth century, the book had essentially achieved a techno-
  logical equilibrium. It was a device that gave permanence to human expres-
  sion; it could contain many kinds of information, from the novelistic to the
 encyclopedic; its physical structure provided easy access to that information;
  its quality of inks and paper and bindings made it readable; its size and weight
 made it comfortable to hold and portable; and its efficiencies of production
 and the availability of its raw materials made it affordable. Several factors
 converged to disturb that equilibrium, however. One was the cost of paper, in
  part a result of the unrestricted global depletion of forests that reached a
  critical point midway through the twentieth century. The depletion was not
 caused by the book industry alone but by all forms of commerce that relied on
 paper, from building materials to newspapers to office supplies. Recycling, a
 necessary response, increased the cost of paper as well.
  The intrigue of digital reading environments became another factor. Whereas
  the development of the three-dimensional book was an evolutionary adaptation
  to reading needs, part of the move to electronic books has been a response to the
  possibilities inherent in the technology itself, not exclusively to greater demand
  for the book to be something more than it already was. Experiments occurred in
 the 1980s that involved exploiting the new medium of digital hyperlinks to
 replace the three-dimensional novel’s authorially determined narrative struc-
  ture with a more reader-oriented and aleatory one. The experiments, such as the
 1990 Afternoon: A Story and Disappearance: A Novel by Michael Joyce, are
 fascinating, highly innovative reconceptions of narrative and of the reading

     determined outcomes prescribed by the book’s static printed form. Such hyper-
     texts do not attract large audiences of readers, however, and remain a curiosity
     rather than a trend. As of 2011, Amazon.com has been selling more books in
     electronic format than it does physical books through the mail, but the contents
     of the electronic books are not, like Joyce’s are, responses to their new technol-
     ogy — they remain in most cases uninfluenced by it, and their text remains the
     same whether read in electronic format or as a physical book. In fact, most are
      first produced as physical books and later, or simultaneously, as electronic
      texts. The authorial imagination, and the imaginations of readers, still seem
     to dwell in the world of the physical book, or the world of electronic books that
     are at most modestly changed versions of the physical book.
      The evolution of the book prior to the advent of digital technology witnessed
     a symbiotic relationship between the contents of the codex and its technologies;
    human demand for written communication required technological responses
     that produced the book, and technological improvements to the book and its
     manufacturing processes opened the book to new audiences, genres and pur-
     poses. Digital technology has released the text from the book’s physical struc-
     ture, altering the conditions within which the book, in the form of electronic
     text, can be experienced. Electronic texts take the feature of portability to a new
     realm, reduce the reliance on the commodity of paper, offer easier access to the
     text itself via instant downloading capability, and provide more efficient
     dynamics of searchability, taking readers to the furthest remove yet from the
     time when, to access information, humans travelled to where it was inscribed,
     immoveable, in stone. The real revolution inspired by digital communication
     technology — computers and android devices that upload and download text
     and visual information accessed from everywhere — has transformed almost all
    communications media. We still, as of the time of writing, live within a period of
     technological overlap, during which one medium of communication coexists
     with its potential successor. Many years into the digital universe now, however,
     the physical book does seem to maintain a relatively stable position in the
    human imagination — a testament to its bestowal of permanence on a text,
     and its accessibility and readability and affordability.

      Handwriting and the book
    As is true for those working in many fields in the humanities, to write a
    chapter on ‘handwriting and the book’ would have been much more straight-
    forward twenty or thirty years ago. Handwritten manuscripts then occupied a
     very specific position in the study of literary texts. If they were created after
     the establishment of the printing press in Europe in 1450 and the subsequent
     ‘revolution’ brought about by cheap print, manuscripts were understood as
     the first steps towards a printed book, drafts preceding print, of interest in
    understanding the creative processes and (if existing in multiple versions)
    supplying the variants to be compiled in preparing the best possible modern
     print edition. If they never achieved the status of a printed book, however,
    post-1450 manuscripts, especially those of the seventeenth through nine-
     teenth centuries, were understood to have been created under adverse circum-
     stances, whether that be official censorship by church or state, lack of access
     to a press, or lack of preparation by the author (traditionally imagined as a
     solitary individual) to engage with the world of print or fitness to enter the
    world of commercial letters.
     The changing focus of textual studies and bibliography over the last twenty
     years has confirmed that handwritten texts and printed ones do indeed
    occupy such roles and relationships and these remain fruitful areas for further
     study. Nevertheless new scholarship has increasingly drawn our attention to
     the complexities of the relationships between the handwritten and the printed
     text and between the writers and readers of both, highlighting how the
    concept of ‘manuscript’ as a technology overtaken and made obsolete by
     print obscures the extent to which print indeed can generate, sustain and
    organize handwriting.’ The habits of looking at post-medieval European and
    Scandinavian manuscripts in particular as somehow longing to be in print,
    and of looking at print as being a marker of commercial success and thus
     readership, obscure and oversimplify the complexities of not only the post-
    1450 physical objects themselves, but also the varied ambitions of a book’s

      Medieval manuscript volumes and printed handwriting
 The word ‘manuscript’ means quite simply ‘written by hand’, and the
 European medieval manuscript book produced between the fifth century
 and the late fifteenth century was the product of many hands.” A variety of
  scribal practices were involved in producing manuscript books, which ranged
 from such richly illuminated texts as the Book of Kells (the 340-folio work
  created by ninth-century Celtic monks) to plain texts of the bible done in a
  single volume in Paris in the 1200s (whose double-columned octavo format,
  use of thin paper and divisions into chapters still is the standard format for
 printed bibles today). The creation of such books involved the labours of the
 person who prepared the vellum or parchment paper, the scribe, a rubricator
 who added in the coloured inks and typically a separate illuminator.’ Initially
 manuscript books were produced in monasteries in spaces devoted to the
 production of texts only. In the scriptorium, groups of monks produced
 copies of manuscript texts, usually for the monastery’s library, or perhaps
  for presentation as gifts. By the fourteenth century, however, demand for
  these handwritten books had increased to such an extent that commercial
  scriptoria emerged, typically located in major European cities such as Paris
 and Rome and also in the Netherlands, those in Paris sometimes employing
 women as illuminators and scribes.*
  The physical design of medieval, preprint manuscript volumes signalled
  their possible use and audience. Books that were created for medieval mis-
  sionaries to help spread the Gospel, for example, were different from those
 created for the royal courts of Henry II and Charlemagne; prayer books
 created for use in a home were correspondingly different from those intended
  for a life in the monastery or parish church. The largest books, such as a
  lectern Bible from which the monks would read aloud to each other, required
  a very large piece of vellum, only folded once to make its pages. In contrast,
 Books of Hours were designed to be held in the hand and are frequently
 shown in medieval art as being read by ladies. Such manuscript books are
 typically heavily decorated with miniature scenes helping to guide the reader
 through the day. This was not a book used in the official Church services and
 the contents were frequently customized to suit the owner (for example
 prayers to St Margaret being associated with childbirth) and often the
 names and dates of important domestic events such as births, deaths and
 marriages were added to the individual book. The Book of Hours was, as
  critics have observed, ‘the basic book for medieval household ... it was from
 the Book of Hours that children were taught to read’, and it sold throughout

     As recent studies of medieval manuscript books have highlighted, ‘the
    manuscript text is constituted by the individuals who created it: scribe,
    rubricator, corrector, illuminator’ rather than by its subject matter alone,
    with the result that ‘manuscript culture takes up its physical residence in that
    same world of variation, imprecision, and error’ and ‘each medieval “text”
    was as unique and concrete as the individual who copied or read it’. To
    attempt to read and understand a medieval handwritten book in terms of a
     single author or a stable text, John Dagenais asserts, is to deny the medieval
    practice of ‘ethical reading’ based on a process of the active reader’s judgment
    and choice, the text changing through time with the addition of glosses,
    commentaries and marginalia into a different handwritten book from that
    which left the original scribe’s hands.°
     With the advent of print in Europe, early printed books (incunabula) were
    designed to look like handwritten ones, also signalling their possible use and
    audience. Studies of the development of type suggest that European printers
     in the 1500s were deliberately using formats already made familiar to readers
    from handwritten books, from the use of ligatures to link letters, common
    abbreviations, the formats of how the books began and ended and use of
    elaborate enlarged capital letters.”7 The printer Aldus Manutius (1449-1515)
    who founded the Aldine Press in Venice based the italic font used in his 1501
    edition of Virgil on his own handwriting; his typefounder Francesco Griffo
    created the first roman type by modelling it after classical Roman carved
    capital letters. Aldus also invented the octavo format for printed books
    modelled on the private pocket notebook, a small volume that could be easily
    carried on one’s person. Some incunabula have been described by literary
    historians as ‘pseudo-manuscripts’, or even as attempts to ‘counterfeit’ a
    handwritten text, a claim mostly rejected by recent book histories.®
     The technologies of handwriting and of printing were both essential in
    creating these early printed books. This is highlighted in the practice of
    rubrication, or the addition to the page of passages done in coloured inks
     (typically red, but sometimes blue or green) often to announce the beginning
     or ending of a section, but also serving as decorative rulings on the page.
    The majority of incunabula, Margaret M. Smith has argued, ‘did not issue
    from the press in a finished state .. . [i]t is possible that hardly any incuna-
    bula was considered to be “finished” by its printer’, but typically would
    require hand finishing, due, she argues, to the cost of printing with red or
    coloured inks.? Thus, from their origins, printed books have had a compli-
    cated and reciprocal relationship with handwritten ones and the technolo-
     gies that produce them.
     We find the self-conscious attempt by medieval printers to represent hand-

 England, news both foreign and domestic could be obtained by those living in
 the countryside by a subscription to a scribal newsbook compilation, such as
 those issued twice a week by Henry Muddiman (1629-92) in the late 16508
 and throughout the early years of the Restoration. When Ichabod Dawks
 (1661-1731) created a printed version of the scribal form, Dawks’ News-
 Letter (1696-1716), he had special type created, ‘Scriptorial English no. 2’, to
 mimic the appearance of the handwritten letter, and left a space blank at the
 top for a handwritten salutation to an individual subscriber. The printers of
 such news publications thus created the suggestion of intimate, inside knowl-
 edge about politics and foreign affairs being privately communicated by
 mimicking the appearance of handwriting and the format of earlier manu-
 script subscription-only publications.
  The strategic use of script over print characters continued in the nineteenth
 and twentieth centuries, especially in publications which sought to distinguish
 themselves from more popular, commercial works. The use of handwriting
 suggested exclusivity as well as an artistic appreciation of the page. The
 modernist literary journal The Neolith (1908) published by the poet and
 popular children’s writer Edith Nesbit (1858-1924) to which George
 Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells and G. K. Chesterston contributed short stories
 and poems, was a magazine printed on folio-sized sheets. It used calligraphy
 by Graily Hewitt reproduced by lithograph, the technique of printing typi-
 cally reserved for fine art drawings. Hewitt had the unenviable task of copy-
 ing the contributions onto special transfer paper and organizing the layout of
 the page without knowing what else might be submitted. Not too surpris-
 ingly, given the amount of unpaid labour involved (only the printer was
 actually paid), this artistic magazine only ran for four issues.*°
     Handwritten culture, hybrid books and social authorship
 The blending of two forms of book production, handwritten and printed, was
 often the result of the desire of the owner to create a unique and personal
 volume, but sometimes it was the result of collaboration between author,
 bookseller and reader. Books gained value, as historians of reading have
 pointed out, by the layers of handwritten glosses and marginalia added by
 their owners. Printed books during the early modern period well into the
 eighteenth century were personalized objects, with the purchaser buying only
 the gathered printed sheets, and then taking them to a bookbinder for an
 individually chosen covering. Owners were invited by the printer or the
 author to correct by hand the printer’s mistakes listed on the errata sheet,

```
     provided the means for the purchase of individual handwritten copies, some
     published writers advertising their unpublished manuscripts in the backs of
     their printed works, urging readers to acquire the handwritten volumes
     directly from a bookseller (H. R. Woudhuysen documents this practice in
     the instance of Thomas Hill in 1571, for example) and there is evidence that
     booksellers were willing to lend manuscripts to be copied by compilers as a
     side-line to selling printed texts. "’
     Some early modern owners took the personalization of their books beyond
     selecting bindings and adding annotations, creating what are referred to as
     ‘hybrid books’, texts that fuse the individuality of handwritten volumes with
     the contents of printed texts. This practice continued in the nineteenth century
     in ‘extra illustrated works’, volumes in which the owner adds extra materials
     relating to the contents, often engraved portraits or scenes: in a New York
     rare book auction catalogue dated 1900, some of the items for sale included
     Item #34, James Boaden’s Memoirs of Mrs. Siddons (1827) containing an
     ‘autograph letter of the author, and numerous scarce portraits inserted’, and
     Item #62, Colley Cibber’s An Apology for the Life of Colley Cibber (1740),
     with 350 additional portraits, an autograph letter, hand-coloured drawings
     of eighteenth-century actresses and other supporting secondary texts includ-
     ing ‘A Lick at a Liar, and other interesting data’.'* The addition of personal
     writing and information, added illustrations, and decorations could thus
     transform a printed text into a unique book where print and handwriting
     illuminate each other within the volume’s space.
      As recent scholarship has highlighted, many early modern readers were
     keen to personalize the volumes they owned, not just with marginal annota-
     tions, but by creating Sammelbande, where multiple texts were bound
     together as one, creating personal collections sometimes combining printed
     and handwritten texts.'? We find such hybridity in an early example, a small,
     leather-bound duodecimo volume with ‘Life and Death 1600’ picked out in
     gold on the spine. ** It opens with a hand-drawn and coloured frontispiece, a
     familiar memento mori emblem of a small chubby angel, or putto, leaning on
     a skull, in a circular frame, with Latin verses on the opposite page signed ‘Jeff
     Gilbert’ done in a very fine italic hand. This is followed by fair copy verses in
     English and Latin, formally laid out on the page, on the topics ‘Of Death’, ‘Of
     Man’, ‘Of Old Age’ and ‘Of Sickness’, which lead to the interior of the book,
     the printed text of the Countess of Pembroke’s translation of Philippe de
    Mornay, A Discourse of Life and Death (London: William Ponsonby, 1600).
      The printed text, however, does not reside separately from its handwritten
     and decorated paratexts. The central printed device of the anchor on the title
     page is hand-coloured and there are handwritten Latin mottoes in gold ink

 pasted in and hand-coloured, a scene of two men viewing a funeral monu-
 ment, to which has been added an ink inscription in English ‘Time to live &
 Time to dy:/ God grant us live eternally’. Below that is a larger square pasted
 in, a printed image, also hand-coloured, of two figures, one old and one
 young, looking in a mirror as a skeleton watches over their shoulders; framing
 the outside edge of the image on all sides are numbered English verses: ‘r.
 Behold thy self in glass/ As thou art; so he was’. After the end of the printed
 volume, whose capital printed letters are decorated by hand, the book con-
 cludes with another section of manuscript verses, faced by more emblematic
 rectangular scenes. The bound volume closes with the repetition of the
 emblem of a putto in the circle, this time pointing at an image of Christ sitting
 in judgment at the end of time, with the inscription ‘memoratoe novissima’ at
 its feet. At the very bottom of the page ‘Post tenebras spero Lucem’ (‘After
 darkness, I hope for light’, Job 17:12), is added in gold ink. This small volume
 is both an original manuscript collection and a manipulation of a print text,
 incorporating the features of the printed book with the ornate embellishments
 of colour, image and the individual hand choosing the framing devices and
 additional poems.
  It is possible that this hybrid book may have been intended as a gift. The fair
 copy handwritten book preserved its status as a gift object from medieval
 times onward. The young Princess Elizabeth created manuscript books as
 presents; when she was eleven years old in 1544, she copied The Miroir or
 Glasse of the Synneful Soul, translating it from French, ‘as well as the
 capacitie of my simple witte and small learning coulde extende themselves’,
 as a present for her stepmother, Queen Catherine Parr. The following year she
 created a manuscript book of the prayers of Catherine Parr and translated
 them into Latin, French and Italian, dedicating it to her father, Henry VIII.*>
 Both volumes also demonstrate her skills as an embroiderer, the covers of the
 two books being elaborately wrought with silk tapestry patterns interwoven
 with silver thread: the individual books in their content, format and physical
 presentation announce the young woman’s piety, filial devotion, intellect and
 appreciation of the book as a beautiful object.
  The calligrapher and miniaturist Esther Inglis (1571-1624) created fifty-
 nine manuscript books known to have survived from this period, with the
 object of obtaining patronage from members of the royal family or people of
rank and substance. As with Elizabeth’s gift books, these texts were typically
 signed and dated and they were [designed ] [to ] [demonstrate ] [both ] [the ] [accom- ]
plishments of the writer and [the ] [virtues ] [of ][the ] [recipient. ] [Inglis ] [employed ] [a ]

     size of a large stamp), with lines of script only a millimeter high, a measure-
     ment equivalent to the thickness of an American dime.*® The larger books
     she made for the royal family are often bound in a richly embroidered cover,
     one ‘A Book of Armes of England’ created for Henry, prince of Wales in 1609,
     done in velvet with his royal crest in pearls, adding yet another layer of
     material meaning to the content of the text itself through her handwork.*”
     A whimsical continuation of this tradition of handwritten royal gift books
     can be seen in the miniature books created for Queen Mary, wife of King
     George V, in 1922. The 200 tiny books were part of a doll house library
     created by Sir Edwin Lutyens, and measure 4 cm by 3.5 cm; each of the books
      is an individual handwritten text; the collection includes works by Edith
     Wharton, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Rudyard Kipling. Other original
     miniature handwritten volumes in this group include “The Doll’s-house
     cookery book’ by Agnes Jekyll (1860-1937) and E. V. Lucas’s “The Whole
     Duty of Dolls’ calligraphed by E. R. Cross, playing off of the titles of earlier
     printed texts of domestic conduct.*® The handwritten gift books, whether
     their contents were devotional, heraldic or entertainment, gain part of their
     value because of the labour of the scribe and the suggestion of personal
     connection between the handcrafted text, the writer and the reader.
      In the nineteenth century we find an example of the creation of such tiny
     miniature handwritten texts serving slightly different purposes. The novelists
     in the Bronté family entertained themselves as children and young adults with
     creating manuscript books from sheets of folded notebook paper, about 4.5”
     by 3.5” in size. One of the earliest of these was by Charlotte, aged ten, written
     for her younger sister, Anne, entitled “Young Men’s Play’ in 1826; brother
     Branwell and Charlotte not only produced miniature novels, but also ‘pub-
     lished’ a ‘magazine’ which they issued once a month, striving to look as much
     like print as possible. In her miniature novel ‘The Secret’, Charlotte aged
     seventeen dated the manuscript 27 November 1833 and signed with her own
     name, thus claiming the work as her own rather than a collaboration.'? What
     this suggests is that although they grew up in relative isolation at Haworth
     Parsonage in Yorkshire and were mostly educated at home, they were never-
     theless children raised in a literate and literary family, whose father had
     published his own poetry in 1811, and whose awareness of contemporary
     printed poetry and fiction led the 21-year-old Charlotte to write to the Poet

     this example, one can see the ways in which the carefully crafted handwritten
     text, miniature or otherwise, could still serve as a gift but also as preparation
     for entering into a commercial print environment.

  Both reading and writing, however, were part of daily life in seventeenth-
 century England onward. We know about much of this activity through the
 posthumous publication of men’s and women’s poetry, books of devotions
 and autobiographical writings, but obviously this was only a small propor-
 tion of books created and preserved in literate households. Many of these
 manuscript books were designed for everyday use: early modern readers often
 compiled large handwritten volumes of excerpts from printed texts they read,
 arranged and annotated on the page to suit their own needs. This practice, of
 course, has continued unabated through time into the electronic and digital
 age of note-taking and record-keeping. Such personalized handwritten
 volumes range from simple schoolchild exercises to complex commonplace
 books with extensive indexes to aid in finding information quickly, to highly
 personalized collections which resemble private anthologies.*°
  Perhaps one of the most extreme examples of this conversion of multiple
 print texts into a personal volume is Thomas Trevelyon’s Miscellany, a
 654-page manuscript volume which he finished in 1608, and his ‘Great
 Book’ done in 1616.** Trevelyon’s compilations of ‘fragments and broken
 sentences’ were done, he informs us in his epistle ‘to the reader’ of the Great
 Book, ‘to accomplysh my minde, to pleasure my fryndes’. Designed for the
 author’s and the readers’ education and entertainment, the miscellany as well
 as his Great Book include ‘prologues’, page numbers, time lines, calendars, as
 well as biblical and historical genealogies, cautionary tales and proverbs; the
 miscellany also has two hundred pages of hand-drawn images of patterns, for
 mazes, floral borders, alphabets, garden design and abstract motifs and
 decorations, uniting the utilitarian with the decorative.**
  Ona more modest scale, we find numerous examples of early modern readers
 interested in compiling anthologies of verses by themselves and by others, long
 after print was established as a medium for the publication of collections of
 poems. Throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, lyric poetry in
 particular continued to circulate widely and to be collected in manuscript
 volumes prior to reaching print; manuscript miscellanies also frequently include
 poems copied from print sources. Arthur Marotti has pointed to the importance
 of manuscript poetry anthologies and courtly miscellanies as ‘the meeting
 ground of literary production and social practices’.*? The ‘Devonshire MS’,
 for example, contains 194 pieces from the early Tudor period, including verses
 by Sir Thomas Wyatt, as well as an exchange of love poems between Lady
 Mary Douglas and Lord Thomas Howard, most likely compiled by several
 women members of the court.*4 Often the contents of such manuscript antholo-
 gies were collected over several [years, ] [sometimes ] [as ] [items ] [sent ] [to ][the ][compiler ] [as ]

     well-connected seventeenth-century English Catholic family, the Astons, cre-
     ated both types. In the ‘Tixall Miscellany’, Constance Aston Fowler (d. 1664)
     collected poems by her friends, neighbours and brother Herbert as well as his
     acquaintances, including the diplomat Sir Richard Fanshawe, and inserted
     published poems by Donne and others sent to her; Herbert compiled his own
     miscellany which was copied by his wife.*> The nineteenth-century poet and
     critic Samuel Taylor Coleridge is an example of a later writer practising this
     social circulation of handwritten texts and compilation volumes. Prior to
     venturing into print, he first collected his poems and those of his friends in
     manuscript volumes to share with family members; he also transcribed and
     circulated poems by others, recording in Biographia Literaria, doing some forty
     transcriptions of the poems of William Bowles, ‘as the best presents he could
     offer to his friends’.*®
      Other manuscript books evolved over time as they were passed from genera-
     tion to generation. Among the most common of these were recipe books, kept
    by both men and women, and the line was very fine between recipes for creating
     medicines and household remedies for humans and animals and those for the
     creation of confectionary and cosmetics.*” Manuscript recipe books followed
     conventions for recording information, including who was compiling the book,
     where the recipe had come from and, in some cases, whether or not it was any
     good.”® Very often writers who kept one form of manuscript book often created
     others. Ann Fanshawe (1625-80) wrote her Memoirs in 1676 for her son
     Richard, a text which has become an important source for historians of the
     English Civil War as Ann followed her diplomat husband and poet Sir Richard
     on his journeys; she also compiled a household book containing recipes
     acquired on the continent as well as traditional English ones, carefully pre-
     served side by side with medical recipes.*? Another woman writing during the
     English Civil War and Restoration years but speaking from the other side of the
     conflict, Lucy Hutchinson (1620-81), likewise composed a biography of her
    husband for their children and left behind voluminous autobiographical writ-
     ings, as well as a translation of Lucretius, which she presented in a fair copy to
     the Earl of Angelesey.*° Such texts might well be preserved by the family or
     friends, and some such as alchemistical writings of the natural philosopher Sir
    Kenelm Digby (1603~65) ultimately would appear in print; almost twenty
     years after his death, Digby’s servant George Hartman published, ‘for the
    good and benefit of the Publick’, A Choice Collection of Rare Secrets (1682),
     a 272-page book from a manuscript volume entrusted to him by Digby before
     travelling to France.
      The manuscript books of a seventeenth-century English scientist and man
     of letters who was also involved in print publication, Richard Waller

   the print. served for years as the
 secretary to the Royal Society of London, edited the scientist Robert Hooke’s
 writings for a posthumous edition, published accounts of his experiments and
 translated several Continental scientific treatises for print publication, but he
 also left behind two manuscript volumes. He was, notably, the son of a highly
 educated mother, Mary More (who was a painter and essayist and circulated
 her own texts in manuscript copies).?* Waller’s first known manuscript
 volume, the translation of Mapheus Vegius’s (1407-58) addition to Book
 XII of the Aeneid, was prepared between 1674 and 1675 and is a splendid,
 lavishly decorated folio volume that contains only that text. Waller’s ‘The
 Poems of Albius Tibullus’, in contrast, is a smaller octavo volume with gilt-
 edged pages, a fair copy text, whose contents are dated as ranging from 1679
 to 1715, the year of Waller’s death, and include much more than the title
 suggests.** The second book appears to be the same hand throughout, with
 only the poems appearing at the end showing any signs of emendation or
 correction.
  Although the second volume was begun shortly after the first, the two
 volumes offer different concepts of the manuscript book and its relation to
 print. The translation of Mapheus does contain the paratextual elements that
 mark it as a seventeenth-century book, including an oval portrait of a young
 Richard Waller (unsigned but perhaps drawn by his mother) and an elaborate
 title page designed and signed by Waller. Its contents are organized with
 full-page illustrations of the text facing the verses, which are themselves
 ornamented in the margins with whimsical pen drawings using coloured
 inks and gold. This volume was clearly designed not only to showcase the
 young Waller’s skills as a translator of Latin into English verse, but also his
 accomplishments as an artist and a calligrapher. The handwritten book was
 the final, finished product, a magnificent rich text celebrating and preserving
 its youthful creator’s accomplishments.
  In contrast, the 1679 “Tibullus’ volume occupies a more complicated posi-
 tion with respect to printed books. The first 105 folios are devoted to Waller’s
 translation of the Latin poet Tibullus and the poets associated with him
 (including the only known woman Latin poet Sulpicia), but the rest of the
 volume, also in fair copy, contains dated sections of miscellaneous English
 verse. The translation of Tibullus features all the paratextual apparatus of a
 printed book, including an elaborate allegorical frontispiece with facing poem
 ‘The Mind of Ye Frontispiece’, a separate title page stating that ‘The Works of
 Albius Tibullus’ are ‘Englished’ by [‘R. ] [W.’ ] [in ] [1681. ] [The ] [frontispiece ] [drawing ]
 is dated as being by ‘R. W. 1679’ so this project clearly was several years in the

     some places, and uses marginal glosses to give sources. It uses catch words at
     the bottom and a running header along the top, thus mimicking a printed text
      in appearance.
      This carefully crafted manuscript text only takes up the first half of the
     volume. It could have been designed as a gift or presentation copy, except that
     instead of addressing a specific person or patron, Waller includes a two-page
     epistle “To the Reader’, thus again following the template of a printed volume.
     However, rather than addressing an imaginary audience asking for their
     approval and acceptance, Waller instead comments on the convention of
     having a prefatory epistle: ‘It is so customary to enlarge books with a
      Preface, or an epistle’, he begins, ‘that is seems almost as preposterous to
      neglect it, as to forget the Portico, or Gate, in erecting a stately Fabrick:
     Therefore something by way of a Preface’. He continues in a seemingly ironic
     tone, ‘I shall forbeare to trouble the “Reader” with the causes, that induced
     me to this translation, perchance a happy command, perchance my own
     satisfaction’. As he notes, Waller’s presentation of the poems is done in a
     highly personal style which may not suit all readers: ‘it may seem strange that
      I have divided some of the Elegies into three or more Parts which I did to
     render them more takeing and agreeable to the Genius of the Age; their length
     being tedious to a light airie, & volatile witte’.
      The poems in the other gatherings in the volume likewise suggest that this
     was not a manuscript being prepared for the printer, but instead a hand-
     crafted repository for Waller’s final polished versions of his occasional verse,
     gathered together and inscribed at various points over the course of his life,
     and that the book travelled with him to several different residences. There is
     an elegy on the death of his friend and fellow scientist Robert Boyle dated
     1710; there is a recurring figure in the later poems ‘Urania’, described as being
     Waller’s muse for the long poem on the creation of the visible world, a
      retelling of Genesis that entirely omits any reference to the divine and focuses
     instead on atoms and optics. This Urania was most likely his daughter Mary,
     who also is the subject of two other poems in the later section of the volume:
     she was celebrated by an admirer in a poem inscribed on the wall of the
     dancing room at the nearby Sun Inn in Northaw, Hertfordshire, which her
     father transcribed into this volume and then turned into Latin, and, on her
     death, in a poem entitled simply ‘An Elegy’.
      Waller had translated the texts and engraved the frontispieces for several
     Royal Society publications; had he wished to publish this volume, certainly he
     had the means and abilities to do so. The paratextual elements signal his
     awareness of the presence and the needs of an external readership, but he
      leaves his ‘Reader’ a generalized, ironic blank, even though the contents are

     include handwritten texts since ‘not one in 40 libels ever comes to Presse,
    though by the help of MS, they are well nigh as public’.** Individuals such as
     Sir William Haward of Tandridge created a 721-page collection of such
     satires.?> Professional scribes such as Captain Robert Julian assembled manu-
     script collections in bound volumes for paying clients; although as Peter Beal
     has pointed out, unlike medieval scribes, seventeenth-century ones rarely
    signed their works, some by Julian have been identified, such as the collection
     of satires against Charles II from around 1682 owned by Lord Derby and
    hidden in his chimney for safekeeping.?°
      In addition to being the preferred mode of publication for early modern
     political and religious satires, handwritten texts could provide an alternative
     to print when access to presses was limited by geography. In this respect,
     Iceland offers a case study of the importance of the handwritten book after the
    introduction of print to a population. Although the first printing press was
     established in Iceland in 1530 by the last Catholic bishop Jon Arason and a
    complete translation of the bible into Icelandic was printed there in 1584,
    only one press existed in Iceland until the middle of the nineteenth century
    and that was subsequently controlled by the Lutheran church. No secular
     literature was even published in Iceland until the 1760s.*7
      Iceland, like Europe, had had a rich tradition of medieval manuscript literary
    production, notably its Eddas written in Old Norse which were first recorded in
    manuscripts that began appearing in the thirteenth century, such as the Prose
    Edda of Snorri Sturluson (1179-1241), Skaldic poetry and the heroic sagas,
     such as Njdls saga. Iceland historically also enjoyed a relatively high literacy
     rate, even though a largely rural society, and its language remained stable.
    Vidar Hreinsson, in his study of the literary career of the late nineteenth century
    working-class poet Stephan G. Stephansson, discusses the ways in which
     Iceland had a long tradition of both manuscript copying and original literature
     created by mostly self-educated farm dwellers from the seventeenth century
    onward.3® Historians of popular Icelandic literature likewise have observed
     that while in Europe medieval chivalric stories ‘formed the basis for a booming
    book trade from the sixteenth century onwards, in Iceland such materials
     circulated almost entirely in manuscript’. Looking in particular at the circula-
     tion of romances in manuscript, Driscoll notes that while several important
    medieval vellum manuscript collections exist, the vast majority of the surviving
     copies exist in paper manuscript books created after the Reformation and the
     majority of those were written after 1800.”
     One Icelandic cultural critic has gone so far as to declare that with the
     increasing literacy rates in Iceland in the later part of the eighteenth century,
     ‘the nineteenth century became the age of handwritten books’.*° Although there

 Iceland’s or to afford
 printed books. Sighvatur Grimsson (b. 1840) was a servant and a fisherman
 but he was also a highly prolific lay scholar, leaving behind over 160 manuscript
 volumes, including eight anthologies of poetry, collections of chivalric
 romances and autobiographical writings. He was paid to copy sagas for others
 and he also collected them for himself: the title page of one such collection of
 thirty stories announces ‘Icelandic sagas: Based on the best manuscripts, which
  are not widely available, from ancient times. Written in a cold fishing camp
 while all were ashore but finished on the island of Flatey in Breidafjordur in
 1867, by Sighvatur Grimsson of Borgarfjordur, October 1, 1861—December 13,
  £867°.77
  There are further contemporary examples of the ways in which the older
 practice of producing hand-done books during periods in which printed texts
 were also in circulation could be taken up by new groups for subversive
 purposes as well as overcoming geographical obstacles. We see this, for
 example, in the circulation of handwritten newspapers in Finland in the first
 part of the twentieth century and the Samizdat literary culture that flourished
 underground during the Soviet era. Like the writers of satires and lampoons
 of earlier periods, working-class university students in early twentieth century
 Finland in the context of the Civil War fought between the Red and the White
 Guards in 1918 produced their own newspaper, ironically called The
 Enlightener (1914-25), offering parodies of both sides of the conflict and
 revealing the hypocrisy of the church.** Later in the century starting in 1967,
 we find the Soviet Russian Samizdat, meaning ‘self-published’, an archive of
 hand-typed texts including the writings of Alexander Solzhenitsyn and the
 poetry of Boris Pasternak circulated in the post-Stalin era, sustaining an
 underground intellectual and literary culture.*?
   In each of these examples, handwriting or hand reproduction was the only
 way in which the messages of the writers could be circulated among a wider
 readership. Samizdat is one step away from the handwritten manuscript
 miscellany, but like handwritten books in the age of print throughout the
 centuries, it, too, shaped the culture of its creators and readers, sometimes
 directly opposing the dominant print culture, while sometimes simulta-
 neously mimicking and echoing it.

   The coming of print to Europe
 The introduction of printing into western Europe has counted as the signa-
 ture event of the history of the book ever since Lucien Febvre and Henri-Jean
 Martin’s l’Apparition du Livre launched the modern discipline in 1958. The
 purpose of /’Apparition was to demonstrate that Johann Gutenberg’s inno-
 vation was the most important turning point in human history, separating
 modernity from everything that had gone before.’ That conviction is still
 broadly held today. By its lights, Herbert Butterfield’s famous line about
 the scientific revolution — that it ‘outshines everything since the rise of
 Christianity and reduces the Renaissance and Reformation to the rank of
 mere episodes’ — might be more aptly applied to what we have become used
 to calling the printing revolution.”
  There are really two aspects to this idea of a printing revolution. One has
 to do with the development of the book itself. Clearly, the adoption of
 printing made possible major changes in the manufacture, character and
 commerce of books. The quantitative potential alone was stark, and seems
 to have been evident in the 1450s, even before printing itself had a stable
 existence. With a press, a printer could produce far more books than scribes
 and other copyists could ever hope to manage, and those books could be
 sold at much lower prices to more people. The second aspect concerns
 the cultural consequences — and also, although this has been more rarely
 noticed, the cultural constituents — of this transformation in the book.
 Printed books emerged from a new and complex place, the printing house,
 and their forms reflected its elaborate internal customs. Produced in quan-
 tity, books became familiar to many more people, and many more kinds of
 people, than ever before. Those people put them to new and unpredictable
 uses. Not all were immediately or intentionally transformative. But in the
 early modern period the most radical changes generally came from ambi-
 tions to restore the past. So readers devised new knowledge even as they

    the traditions of Christendom. To call this a revolution is legitimate, as long
    as we remember that it was a paradoxical one.
     However, identifying a revolution need not, and in this case should not,
    involve stipulating a transformation into modernity. This is critically impor-
    tant if the concept of a printing revolution is to pass muster, not least because
    modern experiences of print reflect changes that happened long after the
    fifteenth century. (The development of mechanized printing and systems of
    copyright are two examples.) More fundamentally, it ought to be possible to
    conceive of a revolution as a radical change without preconceptions about the
    direction of that change.’ It is a simple point, to be sure, but its implications
    have been neglected. They include resisting the temptation to assign signifi-
    cance disproportionately to phenomena that happen to look significant in
    retrospect while neglecting phenomena more representative of the period and
    place in question. This is all the more important if we do want to appeal to the
    printing revolution to help explain the modern world, because otherwise the
    risk of circularity is very real.
     The other thing to remember is the practical character of this transforma-
    tion. The efforts of Gutenberg’s contemporaries and successors to adopt and
    adapt to the new device were all-important in shaping not only how fast the
    printing revolution proceeded, but what the revolution itself would be.
    Dealing with print required the forging of new places and habits of work,
    and the development of new kinds of governance. Our subject needs to be
    these processes that bound together machine, object and culture. Novel as
    they were, they were not created out of nothing. To use the language of
    ‘impact’ that is common in this field, we must ask about the impact on print
     as well as the impact of print — and about how the one shaped the other.
     For the most part, modern attempts to survey the introduction of print in
    western Europe have fallen short in both these respects. This was partly a
    result of the conventional separation of bibliographical research — history of
    the book proper, as it were - from the discipline of History itself. The one has
    focused on particularity, at the cost of antiquarianism; the other has focused
    on a large-scale ‘shift’, at the cost of teleology.* For the latter, especially,
    aspects of Renaissance printing that seemed to align with progress toward
    modernity — modernity, that is, as viewed from the late twentieth century —
    were singled out for attention, and treated as caused by the press itself: they
    manifested the ‘impact of print’. Those that did not were relegated from view
     as accidental, unrepresentative or insignificant. A simple but poignant exam-
    ple is the spread of printing houses from the German town of Mainz across
    western Europe. Until recently this was represented as a rapid and triumphal
    expansion, such that by 1500 many European cities possessed printing houses

                                 the
subject, the impression was artificial. In reality, printing houses often proved
extremely transient. Collapse followed rapidly on founding. If printers’ fail-
ures had been mapped alongside their beginnings, then the expansion of the
craft would have appeared both more fragile and less inevitable. Moreover,
even where it did take hold, far from imposing its own ‘logic’, print rested
upon much older trade routes and credit practices. And, finally, choosing
the date of 1500 skewed perspectives too, because that proved a peak year.
A sharp and prolonged crash hit the book trade at that time. Many even of the
more substantial operations folded, in a crisis that not only stemmed expan-
sion but also caused a major change in the geography of European printing.
Venice — the primary centre of the late fifteenth century — was supplanted by
Lyon, Paris, Basel and Antwerp. As Pettegree insists, an adequate history of
the advent of printing in western Europe must integrate, and account for,
these setbacks and these dependencies. We cannot understand how the suc-
cessful printers survived to shape the identity and effects of print unless we
appreciate the real contemporary possibility - more, the probability — that
they would not.*
 Printing was not a modern practice, in short, but an early-modern one. It
emerged through experiments both mechanical and social, took on a role
defined in terms of Renaissance concepts of mixed sciences and mechanic arts,
and had to be accommodated to the political and providential perceptions of
that Machiavellian era. And it was precisely because print was a creature of its
time that it could give rise to far-reaching changes.
            Experimenting with print
If the origins of European printing are obscure, that is just as its originator
wished. In this respect, as in others, Johannes Gutenberg was typical of
the ambitious artisans of the time. Trained, apparently, as a goldsmith,
Gutenberg’s first innovative venture was a plan to make and sell metal
brooches to pilgrims, the idea being to profit from a forthcoming religious
festival at the old Carolingian capital of Aachen. He intended to make tens of
thousands — a number large enough to imply some kind of stamping tech-
nique. But he mistook the date of the pilgrimage, and found himself stuck with
a warehouseful of unsellable brooches. Faced with disaster, Gutenberg
resorted to making tantalizing promises to his anxious partners about another,
newer, ‘art and adventure’ that might make good their losses. He insisted upon
secrecy about this project, to the extent of sending agents to dismantle the

     the meanings that they would acquire over the next decades — that they referred
     to experiments in printing.°
     The importance of printing is obvious in retrospect, and was recognized
    quickly by contemporaries. So it is striking to realize that Gutenberg’s early
    experimental efforts were in fact typical of what was a period of artisanal
    ambition. From the late fourteenth century, ambitious master-craftsmen in
     several European centres sought with considerable success to lay claim to the
     status of artists and knowledge-makers, as displayed in a proliferating genre
     of books they produced about their crafts. Goldsmiths are generally recog-
    nized to have been the exemplary case of these ambitious master-craftsmen.
    They not only produced elaborate, intricate models of natural and artificial
    processes in their workshops, but also masterminded collaborations between
     different crafts. Pamela Smith points out that goldsmiths experimented with
    cannon-making, dyeing, locksmithing, horology and engraving as well as
     printing. They also pioneered the Vitruvian rhetoric that printers would
     later use to argue for their elevated status with respect to the mechanic
     arts.’ Gutenberg’s brooches, the mirrored surfaces of which supposedly
    captured virtues emanating from relics, were typical products of this ‘arti-
     sanal epistemology’. And their role as machines of natural magic — also
     typical — casts an intriguing light on the more famous machine that followed.
    Moreover, many of the artisanal experiments of the age involved casting or
    impressing: coiners produced currency and medals, binders used presses
     to stamp designs on the panels encasing manuscript books and carvers
    created woodblocks to make repeated copies of playing-cards and books
     like the Ars Moriendi. All were being pursued at the same time, giving rise
     to objects that were often amalgams of different tools and techniques.
    Blockbooks, for example, incorporated manuscript writing and illumination.
    The first generation of ‘true’ printed books would likewise be amalgams, and
    Gutenberg himself should be regarded as exemplary rather than unique.
     The experiments of goldsmiths and other artisans often involved long
    periods away from prying eyes. Gutenberg was again typical. With the end
    of his Strasbourg venture he disappeared for a few years, until in the late
    1440s he turned up again in Mainz with a project to print books. In 1455, a
     cleric and diplomat named Aeneas Sylvius Piccolomini wrote to tell a
    Cardinal friend just how ambitious his scheme was. ‘All that has been written
     to me about that marvelous man seen at Frankfurt is true’, he reported. He
    had seen pages filled with characters so clear that ‘your grace would be able to
    read it without effort, and indeed without glasses’. Somehow Gutenberg had
    almost finished printing not only a book, but the book: the Bible. Piccolomini
    promised to try to buy a copy. But he was not optimistic — ‘buyers were said to

printing. The success had not been immediate or easy. It turns out that in his
earlier labours Gutenberg did not use punches and matrices to generate many
identical copies of a single character — the kind of technique that many would
regard as definitive of printing itself. He instead made many versions of each
letter substantially by hand, using moulds of sand in a technique similar to
that employed by metalworkers to model fragile objects. The practice
resembled a translation of late-medieval handwriting into metal. Only a little
later would type-founders move to more uniform punch-and-matrix produc-
tion, and with it the adoption of the coherent styles — fonts — that would set
printed books apart from the products of scriptoria.? For decades, what we
conventionally call ‘printed’ books would be better thought of as amalgams
of print and manuscript. Printed letters originated as metallic extensions of
handwriting, and printed sheets would often be sent on to an illuminator’s
workshop for finishing by hand.
  It is significant that Piccolomini believed that the whole impression
(roughly 180 copies) was already spoken for. If he was correct, this implies
that Gutenberg, perhaps remembering the debacle over brooches, had taken
care to minimize what would become the bugbear of printers in the future: the
locking-up of capital during printing itself. At the very origin of European
printing lies a cautionary tale about the fragility of the whole enterprise. With
a printed book, the entire impression must be produced before any one copy
could be sold, and that might mean a delay of months (or years, for very large
projects). This was a major problem, as printing houses typically did not have
large financial reserves, and credit was at best hard to secure. Gutenberg was
experimenting not only with novel techniques, but also with novel means of
funding those techniques. And his experiment failed. At this very moment his
backer, Johann Fust, sued Gutenberg for unpaid debt. It seems that he won
and seized the entire printing operation. Fust then put it to use himself, in
partnership with his adopted son, the cleric and scribe Peter Schoffer. The
most spectacular result was their 1457 Mainz Psalter — the first book ever to
contain a statement identifying its printer.
 Gutenberg largely vanishes from the record after this. But it does seem that,
his initial secrecy notwithstanding, he was involved in the initial spread of
printing beyond Mainz. A different bible was soon being printed in Bamberg,
with type modelled on his earlier characters and presumably with his consent.

     inventing printing itself. From Bamberg, Johann Nicolai and Georg Herolt
    ended up in Perugia and Rome respectively.’° The art that provided for
    communication at a distance was dispersed, not through the circulation of
     texts, but by the movements of skilled, experienced craftsmen.
               The printing house at work
    The printing houses that these early craftsmen established soon became
    complex operations. Printing required the labours of many different kinds
     of people: the master-printer himself, pressmen — two per press, compositors,
     correctors, apprentices and the general dogsbodies known as ‘devils’. The
    movements of all these people and things had to be coordinated over long
     periods — a tricky task for a small house, with only two presses, but much
    more complex for the largest, with nine or ten. Sustained collaboration was
     thus all-important. It had to depend on customs and rules. Yet no single
    model for this new kind of place had existed in 1450. So early printers had
     to decide for themselves what arrangements would govern the workers in
     their relationships to each other, their masters and the outside world. The first
     half-century of print was a time of experiment not only in machinery but also
     in these social systems.
      Conventionally, in early modern crafts the virtues and vices of a master-
     craftsman extended to the reputation of his workshop and its products.
     Perceptions of the character of the printer and of the books he produced
     were thus inseparable. So who were these men? It is not always easy to tell.
    The first generation, connected directly with Gutenberg, Fust and Sch6ffer,
     often have obscure backgrounds. But Nicholas Jenson may have worked in a
     mint, Anton Koberger was a goldsmith and Mentelin had been a scribe — all
     trades from which print borrowed customs and techniques. Succeeding gen-
     erations saw practitioners marry into the craft or move into it from cognate
     enterprises like binding (as both Louis Elsevier and Plantin did) or bookselling
     (as did Henri Estienne).
     The model of the master-printer that such figures pioneered was partly
     shaped by the conjunction of the invention of printing with the climax of
    humanism. A generation of renowned scholar-printers — Johann Amerbach,
    Johannes Frobenius and Johannes Oporinus in Basel, Sweynheym and
     Pannartz in Rome, Manutius in Venice, Henri and Robert Estienne in Paris,
    Koberger in Nuremberg — established the ideals to which a master should
     aspire. These balanced the figure at a kind of Lagrangian point, as it were,
    between the attractions offered by the roles of craftsman, artist and scholar.
    The prime exemplar in the German lands was perhaps Amerbach, who

```

 started out as a Parisian student of before the master of a
 printing house in Basel and devoting it largely to the production of patristic
 works. His counterpart in the south was surely Manutius, who had been a
 scholar before launching his printing house, and remained one while a
 master-printer. Each of these figures also became something of a patron in
 his own right, forming a household in which humanist scholars (Erasmus, for
 example) would live and work on the production of editions alongside the
 family of the paterfamilias.
  Scholars venturing into the printer’s domain found themselves in an alien
 and intricate cultural space. By the second or third generation, major houses
 had annual, seasonal and daily time disciplines, expressed in a panoply of
 customs and ceremonies. The best documented was the officina plantiniana
 which Christophe Plantin established in the 1570s, and its records give us a
 good sense of what it was like to work in the trade. Journeymen were
 expected to be present by 5am, in order to start working at 6am (late enough
 to allow them to attend mass); they would work until 8pm, by candlelight if
 necessary during the winter months. They were paid by how much they
 produced, which meant that they tended to agitate to be allowed to work
 even longer. But for pressmen in particular it was a long, arduous day, and
 journeymen could take drinks, including beer, to sustain themselves, either
 singly or, at set times, in groups. Because coordination was crucial, the house
 imposed penalties if one worker should fail to keep up with the others. During
 the 1560s Plantin also banned disputes over religion for the disruption they
 were liable to cause, on pain of almost a day’s wage — double the fine for
 brawling.
  The workers in printing houses organized themselves into what they called
 chapels. In Plantin’s house the chapel started early and became remarkably
 sophisticated, with a finely graduated structure of ordinances upheld by fines
 and other punishments (including a spanking with the official chapel slipper).
 Such penalties could be levied on the master, or even on visitors. A formal
 procedure existed for making and addressing accusations, which ordained
 that they be entered into a ‘complaints book’ and brought before an internal
 court for adjudication. The court had an elaborate hierarchy of offices,
 numerous enough that every member of the house served in some capacity
 at frequent intervals. The results seem to have been harmonious enough, by
 and large, although there were moments of internal conflict. In 1572 Plantin
 even told a Spanish contact that he had threatened to shut down altogether
 out of frustration at one such clash, but it seems that this was exaggerated
 for effect.**

     labour, however, and at first few seem to have acknowledged any obligation
     to teach them the craft beyond what was needed for the task at hand.
     Moreover, because printing was not initially integrated into guilds, it was
     possible for a worker to leave an apprenticeship in one town after a brief
     period and take up work as a journeyman in another region — hence the
     itinerant lives of many self-proclaimed journeymen. By the early sixteenth
     century, printing communities in various towns were starting to form rules
     similar to those long operative in other crafts, limiting apprentices’ numbers,
     mandating their training and requiring that they live with their masters.**
     From about this point the end of an apprenticeship began to be an occasion
     for elaborate ceremony. A German ritual known as the Depositio Cornuti
     Typographici survives to indicate what this involved. The festivities formed a
     sequence in which the apprentice, dressed up as a smelly, red-nosed, horned
     beast, was roundly abused in knockabout fashion before confessing his sins,
     figuratively dying and being reborn and baptized into his new identity. '* This
     kind of thing seems to have been quite common, and it underlined the
     conjunction of skill, rationality and morality that defined the printers as a
     well-ordered community.
                  The rules of the book
     Most of what these workers printed were not books at all, but proclamations,
     administrative documents and the millions of indulgences that enterprising
    churchmen commissioned. Not only did these not require the locking-up of
     capital in an impression, but they could also be paid for in advance, effectively
     removing all risk.'4 But to the extent that it was a book industry, printing
     depended on existing networks of communication, credit and commerce. The
     houses that lasted were in places linked to long-established city fairs
     (Frankfurt, Leipzig), those with sophisticated trade and financial systems
     (Venice, Antwerp) or, to a lesser extent, those with secure cultures of patron-
     age and political power (Rome, Paris). A good counterexample is the thriving
     town of Albi. In 1475 Albi became the third French town with a printing
     house. But the place was simply too remote from trade routes. The printer
     responsible — another veteran of Mainz — soon departed for the mercantile
     centre of Lyon, leaving Albi without a printing house for the next 200 years."
     Spain, then the most powerful nation in Europe, was Albi writ large: because
      it was not a nodal point for trade, most printers there remained small-scale,
     itinerant artisans. '° Even a university, it is worth noting, was not necessarily
     sufficient to provide enough of a book market to sustain a publishing printer.
    Academic publishing is a more recent and fragile creation than it is comfort-

                          several major cities hosted a
 dozen or more printing houses working simultaneously. And a number of the
 larger houses addressed a continent-wide marketplace. The question there-
 fore arose of how houses should interact with each other when they targeted
 the same readers. Consider, in particular, what should happen if one printer
 tried to issue an impression of the same work as another for the same market —
 a problem that had never previously existed in any consistent way. Hans
 Amerbach in Basel and Anton Koberger in Nuremberg faced it in 1499, and
 the result was a complex, intricate correspondence making explicit the ways
 in which such issues were seen in terms of Renaissance conceptions of honour,
 virtue and obligation. ** Civility might not dictate a particular outcome, but it
 certainly defined the range of positions open to a responsible printer or
 bookseller. Still, in general it was unclear where the moral right lay, what
 conventions should govern the conduct of the clash, and who had the author-
 ity to decide an equitable outcome.
  As the trade and its markets expanded, the question thus became that of
 developing protocols for managing these kinds of disputes in general. How to
 shape a responsible craft of the printed book, in harmony with itself and the
commonwealth? The urgency of this question was accentuated by anxieties
 about the power of an ill-ordered book trade to destroy the peace of the realm
 itself — as, in the view of many contemporaries, happened during the more
 violent episodes of the Reformation. Over the course of the sixteenth and
 early seventeenth centuries, a number of cities created legal, institutional and
customary structures to address this problem of order. Four characteristic
 institutions emerged: the privilege, the register, the guild and the licence.
  The earliest city to develop a complex, interlaced kind of administration
 seems to have been Venice. It is worth pausing there, as many other cities
would tread a similar path. In the fifteenth century, the principal way in which
 the Republic’s authorities engaged with the new craft was by the issuing of
 privileges. A privilege granted its beneficiary the exclusive power to print and
 sell a certain work for a defined period, ranging from one to about twenty
years. Although privileges were instruments of long standing and wide appli-
cation in every European jurisdiction, their use with respect to printed books
was new and it took decades to be standardized. It is important to realize that
 a privilege was not a right: one could not expect one simply by virtue of
having a new book to print. Privileges were entirely in the gift of the author-
 ities, and they had to be requested, giving reasons. In Venice, early requesters
often specified a need to secure the quality of books — which meant bemoan-
ing the intrinsic disorder of the trade, ‘by which’, as one applicant put it, ‘the

     reprinting, as detailed in a bid by Bernardino Rasma in 1496. Rasma com-
     plained of reprinting as a ‘pernicious and hurtful corruption’ that had appar-
     ently become endemic: anyone undertaking a substantial book should expect
     other printers to ‘steal the proofs of the new work from the hands of the
     pressmen, and set to, with many men and many presses, to print the book
     before the original designer can finish his edition, which, when it is ready for
     issue, finds the market spoiled’.*?
      Privileges were awarded in large numbers. But it seems that evasion or
     avoidance — or, given that no archive existed to show what privileges had
     already been awarded, sheer ignorance — was fairly routine. By the early
     sixteenth century the situation was becoming unworkable. Printers would
     apply for them willy-nilly, blocking rivals while not actually publishing the
     works themselves. In 1517 Venice responded by passing the city’s first law to
     standardize privileges. It abruptly cancelled every existing patent, at a stroke
     rendering all books common. From then on, privileges could only be granted
     for unprinted works, and they would require a two-thirds vote of the Senate.
     At almost the same time, imprimaturs (licences) were standardized too, again
     in a bid to protect the value of the trade from a reputation for textual
     corruption. Later measures added that a privileged, licensed book must be
     printed in Venice itself, published in good time and sold at a price the state
     deemed reasonable.
       In 1549 a guild (or “‘University’) was established for Venice’s book trade,
     centred on the grand church of SS Giovanni e Paolo. The idea seems to have
     been to provide a focal point for the Republic to oversee the trade by these
     measures, and at the same time to make printers and booksellers police
     themselves. The new body was responsible for upholding the general quality
     of printed work produced in the Republic, and specifically for tracking down
     clandestine books. It had a ‘prior’, two ‘councillors’ and six ‘assessors’,
     elected annually, along with a secretary and a beadle. A register was also
     created, to record all books published in the city. Evasion remained common-
     place, of course, but by the mid-seventeenth century the combination of guild,
     register, licence and privilege seems to have become a stable, moderately well-
     functioning system.
     Many cities where printing and bookselling endured seem to have devel-
     oped similar systems to that of Venice. Not all cities adopted every element —
     Spanish towns, for example, often left printing unincorporated — and in those
     that did the details varied. But the general trend was clear. So, for example, in
     Antwerp the Guild of St Luke, previously devoted to artists, became the
     corporate home of bookmen in 1557. The same year, the Stationers’
    Company was chartered in London to oversee the English trade. The Paris

                        of this increasingly baroque
 regulatory culture was the emergence of rules favouring authors. In 1545
 Venice, again ahead of the pack, decreed that in order to get an imprimatur a
 book’s printer must possess a written statement by its author consenting to
 the publication. This seems to have been the first regulation expressly recog-
 nizing something akin to an authorial right, and it is significant that its origins
 lie in the convergence of systems dedicated to producing an orderly trade ina
 well-ordered commonwealth.
  It is important to recognize, however, that the four ordering institutions of
 print generated conflict as well as consensus. One cause was the emergent
 distinction between printer and publisher. For much of the early modern
 period, ‘publisher’ was not a consistent trade role. But the printed book
 increasingly became an object of speculative financing. Wealth gravitated
 away from the ‘mechanick’ practitioners of the press and towards those
 who dealt in ‘copies’, as these speculative entities were called. Copies were
 constituted as property by the register and privilege systems. Eventually
 copyright laws would entrench them, although at the time copyright seemed
 the very antithesis of property. The shift was acutely felt by printers, who
 regularly complained that the virtues of the master-craftsman were being
 subordinated to an unprincipled rapacity. Such complaints of course were
 widespread in the economy of the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
 as the commercial and industrial transformations of the age gathered steam.
 The book trade was as riven by them as any other economic community.
  More fundamentally, the protocols of order were fundamentally incompa-
 tible with each other. Whereas privileges expressed the authority of the
 prince, guilds and registers recorded the authority of a craft, based not in
 royal legitimacy but in trade customs. In many jurisdictions, for example,
 it was possible to practise as a printer outside guild control by royal privi-
 lege.*° In England the King’s Printer and the University Presses of Oxford
 and Cambridge operated under privileges, and thus under different legal and
 political principles from the Stationers. The Stationers’ Company saw them as
 interlopers, and by its own lights it was right to do so; but by the same token
 they could represent its resentments as /ése-majesté. The longest-running
 sequence of such clashes was probably that in France, which extended from
 the early seventeenth century right through to the Revolution, and drew in
 prominent philosophes on both sides of what was eventually reconstrued as a
 clash over the concept of authorial property.** Here, as elsewhere, this
 intractable conflict inspired the first sustained reflections on the nature and
 implications of print itself.

    Empire issued privileges for much wider areas), and printed books circulated
     far beyond any such realm. International book merchants needed rules too, or
     at least shared customs that could be relied upon. Continental distribution
    came to centre on a few major hubs that long predated print: the merchant
     fairs of Germany, with Frankfurt and later Leipzig to the fore. The Frankfurt
     fairs in particular were lavish mercantile events held twice annually. While the
     fair lasted, free and fair trade reigned, with well-developed credit conventions
     extending from one fair to the next. For a new craft, short of ready cash and
     needing to reach a dispersed population, the opportunity was obvious. So
    book dealers from south and east of the city took the opportunity of the
     second of the annual fairs to rendezvous. Dealers soon started coming from
     further away: the Netherlands and Italy (especially Venice), then France,
     England, Austria and beyond. They began printing catalogues of the books
     they were bringing to sell and exchange, and by the later sixteenth century the
     city itself had taken on the task of publishing a collective list. It became the
     closest thing early modern Europe had to a catalogue of ‘books in print’.
     By this time, the Frankfurt fair had become Europe’s biggest venue for the
    commerce of books. The town outlawed the unauthorized reprinting of titles
     offered there, and a custom of bartering sheets permitted dealers to distribute
     books across the continent without lugging around large amounts of cash.
     Moreover, Frankfurt was also the venue for conversations out of which
     books emerged. Scholars and other authors flocked there to make contacts
     and to discover the latest intellectual currents. As the bookseller Henri
     Estienne put it in his 1574 encomium to the fair, which he termed a great
     university (academia), such encounters made the event unique. ‘Right in the
     shops of the booksellers’, he reported, one could hear scholars from across
    Europe ‘discussing philosophy no less seriously than once the Socrateses and
     the Platos discussed it in the Lyceum’. The Frankfurt fair realized the ancient
     ideal of the encyclopedia: it encompassed ‘the whole circle of knowledge’.**
     This civic-mercantile-scholarly confluence had become the central node of
    European intellectual culture.
      So print did allow for influence to extend across large distances, but mainly
    by exploiting long-standing trade prerogatives that were peculiar to specific
     towns. It could not simply transcend locale altogether. Nor did its practi-
     tioners necessarily want to, because boundaries could be put to use. By the
     mid-sixteenth century several Swiss towns, Calvinist Geneva in the van, were
     taking advantage of them to export Protestant books to Catholic France and
     Spain with impunity. By the eighteenth, as Robert Darnton has famously
    shown, the “Typographical Society of Neuchatel’ would be making a fine
     trade of reprinting French works and sending them surreptitiously back into

                competition obtained across the hundreds of
 German states and statelets, imperial privileges notwithstanding. Print’s
 apparent power to overcome space and time depended partly on these ven-
 tures — ventures that only existed because of bounded jurisdictions.
              The powers of print
 Wherever the distinctiveness of print ultimately lay — in the ability to multiply
 copies, the potential to act at a distance or the power to stabilize texts — the
 key to understanding it lies in these measures and the anxieties that provoked
 them. The nature of the printed book emerged from social machinery as much
 as from technological. But what did it then do?
  In the first place, there are several qualities that Gutenberg’s contempor-
 aries and successors identified in printed books, and which they believed to be
 significantly different from the qualities of earlier, hand-copied volumes.
 There were a lot more of them. They could be acquired at cheaper prices.
 They circulated more widely and became familiar to poorer and more distant
 parts of society. Copies from a given impression existed in large numbers and
 were functionally identical. And they were generally products of speculative
 commerce: printing an impression meant venturing capital on the uncertain
 prospect of future profit. All of these perceptions took hold early, and all
 attained the status of truisms.
  But contemporary writers, readers and printers found that in each of these
 cases the simple formula had to be substantially qualified when it came to
 using real printed books. There were many books that were not popular,
 widely distributed, identical within an impression and so on. Indeed, a
 rational fifteenth- or sixteenth-century reader might well doubt that any one
 book combined all these traits. Printing-house practice made this reasonable,
 because, as modern investigations of authors like Shakespeare have made
 clear, impressions would often be corrected ‘on the fly’, producing variations
 across superficially identical copies. Nor was this necessarily a mark of fail-
 ure — of mistakes, incompetence, corruption and the like. Amalgams of print,
 woodcut and manuscript might be regarded as exceeding the standards of
 print alone. This was certainly the case, for example, with a humanist book
 like Florentine poet Francesco Berlinghieri’s Seven Days of Geography,
 printed by Niccolo Tedesco in Florence in the 1480s. Berlinghieri’s volume
 combined letterpress with engravings; and it merged print and manuscript
 too, with presentation copies being illuminated and hand-coloured, rendering
 each an individuated object. [It ] [also ] [combined ] [commercial ] [production ] [and ]

     powers of print, but largely because it departed from simple models of print in
     every way.’*
      Sometimes print implied the familiar truisms, then, but not always. When it
     did not, it was nonetheless print for all that. Being a good reader of printed
     books might well involve maintaining a delicate balance between faith in the
     virtues of print in general and caution about the extent to which any given
     book would display those virtues — and being a good historian of print
     requires a similar balance. This is really the obverse of the point made
     above, that the powers of print emerged from the careful management of
     complex artisanal and scholarly interactions. The first point to be made about
     the advent of print is therefore simply this: that it multiplied these interac-
     tions, and thereby the amalgams — books — that they generated. The defining
     character of the printing revolution was initially not order or regularity, but
     disruptive proliferation.
      From the outset, a few scholars experimented with making the new craft into
      a tool for learning. It was not necessarily predestined to play such a role, and
     accommodating the worlds of art and scholarship proved a difficult and lengthy
     enterprise. For example, Johannes Miller of Konigsberg, better known as
     Regiomontanus, hoped to print the entire corpus of ancient mathematical
     sciences at his own press in Nuremberg. Conrad Sweynheym and Arnold
     Pannartz projected Pliny’s Natural History in Rome, the philosopher Marsilio
     Ficino oversaw Plato’s works at a press in a Dominican convent, and Aldus
     Manutius took on Thucydides, Herodotus, Virgil and Cicero in Venice. These
     are the high-profile ventures that have often been taken to define the printed
     Renaissance, and they were probably the most important instance of the much-
     celebrated alignment of ‘scholar’ and ‘craftsman’. But many were not commer-
      cially successful (where they were commercial at all), and even Manutius flirted
     with disaster. Still, these early projects defined roles for both the scholar-printer,
      to which publishers would later lay claim, and the learned editor. They led to
     the formation of new genres (the scientific journal, the portable classics pio-
     neered by Manutius, and more), and the adoption of protocols and customs of
     reading in institutions old (schools and universities) and new (Jesuit colleges,
     experimental academies). And they encouraged a critical engagement with
     antiquity that had implications across learned culture,
      This proliferation had wider implications because the domain of the printed
     book — the domain that both scholars and printers complained was falling
     under the sway of unprincipled speculators — had by this time become a
     persistent arena for political and other debate. This happened at different
     rates and in different ways, depending on local conditions. But in many places —
     Venice being one early example — political crises repeatedly generated moments

 They were opportunistic and, in Filippo de Vivo’s word, ‘engineered’. But over
 time — and it took perhaps a century or more — these repeated moves coalesced
 into an ongoing public political realm. Protagonists noted what was happening
 and were ambivalent about it. “Things have changed shape’, noted the Spanish
 ambassador during Venice’s dispute with Rome in the 1600s, as the exchange
 of diplomatic letters gave way to pamphleteering: what had once been compre-
 hensible was now liable to flare uncontrollably (the problem lying in the lack of
 control, not the flaring).*> By the late seventeenth century print was associated
 with a permanent realm of this kind, extending across legal boundaries and
 appealing to readers for allegiance to its ostensibly cosmopolitan values. Its
 claim to authority encouraged the emergence of consistent opposition to licen-
 sing and privileges.
 - _ An especially important element here was the development and entrench-
 ment of communities around shared protocols for reading, and for ways of
 recording and transmitting their readings. Often, but not always, these
 centred on particular titles, the Bible being the best known. There was nothing
 new about this in itself: one could point to the readers of Virgil in antiquity or
 to groups such as the Lollards before printing. But the relationship of reader
 to page now changed. So, because of its engagement with the international
 circulation of print, did a group’s ‘reach’. As readers annotated printed pages,
 recording their interpretations and reactions, they accentuated the already
 hybrid character of books. So normal and essential was this practice that
 in Venice it became illegal for any book to be printed on paper unsuitable
 for readers’ notes; offending volumes were burned and their privileges
 withdrawn.”*°
  There were conventions governing such annotation, and the notes them-
 selves could be transferred from reader to reader, taking with them accepted
 modes of use and interpretation. Owen Gingerich’s exhaustive census of
 Copernicus’s De Revolutionibus shows the importance of this practice.
 Successive readers incorporated previous astronomers’ annotations into
 their own copies of the book, so that when a mathematical reader of around
 1620 encountered a copy, that volume could include the accumulated record
 of decades of readings. ‘Families’ of annotations can be identified, making
 manifest intellectual and practical traditions that we would otherwise miss.
 Through these families of notes (and sometimes more than notes: a few
 readers added their own cut-out paper models to the book), we can discern
 Copernicanism itself taking shape.*7
  Finally, starting in the sixteenth century authors tried to come to terms

    by writing histories of the adoption of printing. In both ways they contributed
     to the development of the first systematic institutions of bibliography and the
     history of the book.
     Where printed books ended up — the lucky few, at least — was in libraries.
     Collections both expanded and proliferated, and their organization became a
    recognized problem. By extension, writers like Konrad Gesner sought to define
     the contours of a new bibliotheca universalis formed by the entire output of the
     press. Through such ventures the world of knowledge itself became conceivable
     in novel ways. It could be atomized, sifted, sorted and mapped, producing new
    systems of knowledge. The readers who were true adepts at these tasks came to
     be highly valued. The best of all were those who could master both the literary
    microcosm and macrocosm, as it were, using simple practices such as the
     stringing of notecards onto cords (fila, the root of today’s ‘files’) to index
     collections, and employing such devices as tools to advance abstract conceptual
     visions about the universal library. Probably the greatest of them all was
     Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who pursued extraordinarily elaborate reflections
     on the implications of an endless amassing of print. Leibniz would yield nothing
     to Borges in his fantasies of a universal library.*®
     Conceptualizations of print’s relation, not just to particular cultures, but to
    human civilization tout court, originated partly in such ventures. But they also
     derived from a new genre of histories of print that emerged in earnest in the
     seventeenth century. At first, this genre appropriated a Vitruvian rhetoric that
    had been used to elevate the status of the mathematical sciences. The implied
     consilience was interesting: in Aristotelian terms the mathematical sciences had
    been regarded as deficient because ‘mixed’, treating physical reality by mathe-
     matical techniques. Printing too was mixed, combining as it did mechanics with
     the liberal arts.*? Beginning in the early- to mid-seventeenth century, however,
    more detailed accounts appeared of printing’s origin and consequences. Many
     of them focused in the first instance on the identity of the press’s inventor, or on
     its introducer into a particular country. Several realms promoted their own
     candidates in competition with the already mysterious Gutenberg: Laurens
     Coster in the Netherlands, Mentelin in Strasbourg and so on. Scholars and
     practitioners competed to identify and appraise what might be construed as
     evidence — and they found that that evidence pointed in different directions. In
     trying to divine a single origin out of what had been a period of diversity and
    mixing (Coster’s Haarlem, for example, had in fact been a centre for the
    production of blockbooks), they extended beyond crediting individuals to
     defining print itself. And they involved characterizing the moral nature of
     printers and printing houses too.*° Beginning with Joseph Moxon’s
    Mechanick Exercises in 1683-4, manuals about printing fleshed out these

 and, later still, by Immanuel Kant.
  Such works were the relatively formal tip of a broad and popular tradition,
 which saw print celebrated not only on pages, but also through processions,
 dinners, images and statuary. By the time of Leibniz’s death in 1716, to deny
 that the advent of print constituted a new historical epoch would have meant
 challenging common sense. The Enlightenment’s vision of itself as a manifes-
 tation of the powers of print was rooted here, in both scholarly understand-
 ings and popular commemorations. Ultimately, it would coalesce into the
 conviction so widely shared today that modern rationality resulted from a
 communications revolution. It was fitting, then, for the leaders of the French
 Revolution to consider moving Gutenberg’s ashes to the Panthéon in Paris, as
 they did in 1792. By this time they could have no doubt that he was the first
 modern revolutionary of all.3*

          CYNDIA SUSAN CLEGG
  The authority and subversiveness
   of print in early-modern Europe
Observations in the work of two leading historians of the book, each of them
considering the influence of the printed word on the French Revolution,
clearly illustrate the different models of authority and subversion that have
informed histories of the book in early-modern Europe. In his 1989 essay,
‘Philosophy under the Cloak’, Robert Darnton observed that:
  the problem of demarcating forbidden literature appears at first as a question of
  language. When the police interrogated one of their prisoners in the Bastille, a
  bookseller named Hubert Cazin who had been caught with all kinds of for-
  bidden books and compromising papers in his shops in Reims, they asked him to
  explain a puzzling term that cropped up often in his correspondence: ‘philoso-
  phical articles’. Cazin defined it as a ‘conventional expression in the book trade
  to characterize everything that is forbidden’. The police had heard other
  terms ... they had a favourite expression of their own: ‘bad books’.'
A few years later, in Cultural Origins of the French Revolution, Roger
Chartier told his readers: ‘With the tripling or quadrupling of book produc-
tion between the beginning of the century and the 1780s, the multiplication of
institutions that enabled clients to read without having to buy, and the
increasing flood of ephemeral print pieces (the periodical, the libel, the topical
pamphlet), a new way of reading, which no longer took the book as author-
itative, became widespread’.*
 Darnton’s conception of authority is traditionally political — the ordering
and policing powers of the state. Subversion in this model is engaging with that
which authority forbids, whereas Chartier relies less on notions of legality than
on features of print and their intersections with a reading public. The concepts
of both institutional and textual authorities — and their subversions — help to
explain the ways in which books impacted culture in early-modern Europe.
From printing’s earliest years the multiple institutions that controlled and
Datronized printing acknowledged the printed word’s authority — but they

```

     subversion was surprisingly complex and requires understanding how printing
     was patronized and controlled both within and across national boundaries. No
     matter how seamless institutional intentions were, however, the real story of
     authority and subversion is told by books — individual books that embodied
     authority and individual books that subverted it. Individual books’ stories
     appear here throughout a narrative that centres on institutions but ends with
      a consideration of the interplay of authorities and subversions in the case of one
     English book, Holinshed’s Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland
     (1587). This story told by institutions and books argues the interrelationship
     between authority and subversion: authority emerged as a response to anxieties
     about subversion, and, conversely, without authority (institutional and tex-
      tual), subversion would not have accounted for much.
      Understanding how official authorities impacted printing in early-modern
     Europe is complicated by national and local differences. Even so, certain
     practices, like monarchs and magistrates issuing privileges, were widespread.
     Except for Papal printing privileges, authority over print did not extend
     beyond principalities. Papal privileges claimed validity throughout western
     Christendom and threatened excommunication to printers who violated their
     protections.* In the Italian city states the heads of state or their agents
     conferred privileges to publishers, printers and authors applying for them.
     Privileges assured their holders the exclusive right to print and sell the book in
     question for a limited time period (the average being ten years). Each privilege
     required a separate application and, in most cases, payment to the issuing
     authority. While an author might seek privileges from multiple authorities,
     printers and publishers usually operated within a single jurisdiction. The
     renowned Venetian printer, Aldus Manutius, obtained a ten-year privilege
     for Pietro Bembo’s writings from the Venetian Collegio, which managed the
     Senate’s business. Aldus’s petition to the Collegio required Bembo’s permis-
     sion since in Venice, uncharacteristically, a printing privilege was contingent
     upon an author’s prior consent. Aldus also obtained a Venetian privilege to
     protect works printed in his own italic typeface — a privilege that was difficult
      to enforce.* In some countries, royal privileges to select printers developed
     into an elaborate system of royal authority over printing, often with a printing
     overseer who appointed censors and assured that privileges were granted only
     upon the censor’s recommendation.
      Akin to privileges for specific books and classes of books were monopolies.
     Most monopolies were enjoyed by a single printing establishment within a
     geographical locale, a diocese or a university, but in England a single London
     guild enjoyed a monopoly that gave its members the exclusive right to exercise
     their craft of printing. For all practical purposes this constituted a national

received its monopoly in its 15 57 charter. Issued by Queen Mary I, the charter
conferred on the Stationers’ Company prerogatives common among English
trade guilds, which included the rights to own property, keep apprentices and
engage in searches to protect the trade from ‘foreigners’ (non-members) and
poor workmanship. It allowed the Stationers to petition the City of London for
a livery (granted in 1560), which assured the Company voting rights in London
and parliamentary elections, participation in London governance and status
among London livery companies. Further, the charter provided for the com-
pany’s government by a master and two wardens, who shared their authority
with the company’s elected court of assistants. In principle, this monopoly, like
those created by individual printing privileges, provided a means by which the
right to print a text or have it printed could be construed as a property right,
although one to be conferred and administered by the company rather than the
Crown.
 The London Company of Stationers’ principal task, besides admitting new
members and administering routine company business, lay in acknowledging
and protecting the integrity of its members’ textual property rights. This was
accomplished through a system of registration. The company’s clerk entered
into the Company’s Register Book: a book’s title, the stationer’s name who
‘owned’ the title, the entry date and, rarely, the author’s name (but only for
identification purposes). The entry constituted a licence to print the entered
title and guaranteed the exclusive right in the copy to the licensee, his heirs or
his assignees. The register also noted before 1639 the ecclesiastical licenser
and, after 1639, the government’s censor who approved the book for pub-
lication. The company’s officers (usually the junior or senior warden) could
issue the company’s licence without ecclesiastical or state authorization if
they felt the book did not violate the law. Company members who trans-
sressed against another stationer’s right in a copy were subject to the jurisdic-
tion of the court of assistants, which issued fines, seized illegal copy and
destroyed offending presses. The government supported the stationers’ print-
ing monopoly by prosecuting non-company printers in the state and church
courts, a protection that disappeared when the courts of High Commission
and Star Chamber were abolished at the outbreak of the English Civil War. In
1662, shortly after the monarchy’s Restoration, Parliament passed a printing
act that reinstated licensing and gave the Secretary of State authority over
licensing, printing and news. This act effectively placed printing and press
control under parliamentary jurisdiction, a precedent that led to subsequent
licensing acts and ultimately [to ]ending [licensing ] [in ][1710, ] [when ] [the ][‘Act ][for ][the ]

     royal authority, formed to administer state surveillance of print. Although the
     language Queen Mary employed in the 1557 patent for the charter reveals
     that she intended the company to serve as a ‘suitable remedy’ to the Protestant
     press, when Elizabeth I confirmed the charter in 1558, she had little interest in
     protecting the Roman Catholic church. This is not to say, however, that the
     Stationers’ Company did not participate in print control. Explicit in the
     Stationers’ Company’s Charter was the notion that the exercise of their
     privilege could not be ‘repugnant or contrary to the laws or statutes of this
     our kingdom of England, or to the prejudice of the commonwealth of the
     same’.> To protect their monopoly, the Company’s best interest lay in pre-
     venting printing against English statutory law — law that protected the mon-
     arch from treason, the aristocracy from scandal and whatever church
     settlement that currently existed from opposition.
      While the English Crown privileged a printers’ guild, throughout Europe
     monarchs, mayors and religious officials, and later parliaments and councils,
     appointed printers to attend to the increasingly prolific printed business of
      state, local or church government. Official printers were usually paid a sub-
      sidy since proclamations, edicts, ordinances, statutes and other such works
     had little commercial value. Sometimes an official printer’s title was honorific.
     Philip II, for example, recognized Christopher Plantin of Antwerp as ‘Arch-
     Typographer of the King’ in the Low Countries. This position held so little
     authority that when Philip II extended his patronage to Plantin for the Biblia
     Regia (1568-72, the polyglot Bible in Latin, Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic)
     Plantin’s press faced financial ruin. Not only did the King neglect payments
     and charge the press for costly vellum copies he commissioned and later
     returned, but it took twelve years for the Inquisition in Spain to approve the
     book for sale.° Neither the King of Spain’s patronage nor a papal imprimatur,
     however, was sufficient to protect Plantin’s rights in the polyglot Bible:
     Plantin still obtained privileges for the eight-volume work in the Low
     Countries, Germany, France, Castile, Aragon, Naples, the Papal States and
     Venice.” In England the position of printer to the king or queen was a
     lucrative office both because anything printed was privileged and because
      official printing included bibles and liturgies (both with considerable com-
     mercial value since each parish church had to purchase copies).
      As this discussion of printing privileges and monopolies suggests, in early-
     modern Europe the means by which authors, printers and publishers retained
     authority over the books they produced also made the books’ contents subject
      to official control. Like the privilege granted to the stationers by their royal
     charter, most privileges operated on at least the implicit assumption that the

 authority. The problem of subverting these authorities, however, was enor-
 mously complicated both by the religious and political differences that spread
 across Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and by the multiple
 authorities that exerted control.
  From ancient times the Christian Church exercised an authority over the
 written word derived from its authority over doctrine and its power to root out
 heresy, so it is not surprising that the Church took an early interest in control-
 ling the new printing technology. In 1501 Pope Alexander VI issued the bull,
 Inter Multiplice, which called upon archbishops to assure that no books con-
 trary to the orthodox faith were printed in their provinces without their
 imprimatur, although they could delegate the jurisdiction for censorship to
 local authorities. The inundation of heretical books spawned by the
 Reformation led the Pope to intensify censorship: and in 1542 Pope Paul II
 instituted the Congregation of the Roman Inquisition, and in 1559 the
 Congregation published its first index of prohibited books (although similar
 indexes had been previously published by some universities’ theology faculties
 and by several local inquisitions, including Spain’s). The 1559 Roman Index
 contained more than 1,000 prohibitions and was divided into three classes: the
 names of authors all of whose works were prohibited, the names of authors and
 specific works, and the titles of anonymous books. It also listed sixty-one
 printers and prohibited anything they printed. The Roman Index imposed
 penalties for possessing prohibited texts and required bookstores to display
 lists of books for sale. Not surprisingly, the first Roman Index named promi-
 nent Protestant reformers, but it also included the humanists, Erasmus and
 Valla, and editions of the bible. Besides the Roman Index, several expurgatory
 indexes appeared. One of these, issued in 1571 under the authority of Philip I
 of Spain, specified passages of offending texts, along with portraits of and
 dedications to offending authors, that should be inked out.*
  The Roman Index may have envisioned a rigorous censorship applicable
throughout western Christendom, but it was embraced only in the Iberian
 peninsula, the Spanish Low Countries, Poland and Bavaria. In Venice, which
 for a time cooperated with the Inquisition, the government saw itself as
 sufficiently Catholic to oversee all pre-print approbation. Although France
 did not embrace the Inquisition, books printed in cities associated with
 heresy, like Geneva, were banned, and the authorities in Paris, Lyon and
 other printing centres issued their own catalogues of condemned books. The
Holy Roman Empire’s political patchwork of Imperial cities, free cities and
principalities vastly complicated [the ] [administration ] [of ] [censorship, ] [even ]

      his religion) some local authorities controlled printing, with the result that
     what was promoted in one city might be banned in another. Even in
     Protestant principalities, the writings of all reformers were not treated
     equally. In the Imperial city of Frankfurt, which housed Europe’s most
     important book fair, the established Book Commission required merchants
     who attended the fair to obtain and display Imperial privileges on their
     bookstalls, publish a catalogue of their offerings and deposit copies with the
     Commission. While the Frankfurt Book Commission could not be described
      as lenient, both Catholic and Lutheran theological works received Imperial
      privileges, clearly contrary to the Roman Index’s intent.
      Catalogues and indexes seem to indicate that after Luther enlisted the
     powerful tool of printing to reform religion, subversion was clear cut, but
     matters were more convoluted. Sometimes books were revised to comply with
     the letter but not the spirit of the law. In Protestant England, somewhat
     perversely, the index was employed to identify desirable books for Bodley’s
      library at Oxford.? Two examples, one of a single book, Jacques-Auguste de
     Thou’s Historiae sui temporis, and the other of a whole class of books,
     Calvinist devotional and instructional literature in seventeenth-century
     England, demonstrate the complicated nature of subversion in a confessional
      age. The Oxford Renaissance scholar Jan Maclean describes de Thou’s book
      as a ‘frank account of recent history written in very elegant Latin by a
     distinguished Gallican magistrate with impeccable Catholic credentials’.
     Before the book’s publication in France, the authorities had forced de Thou
      to remove some passages on the Council of Trent. Despite this alteration, the
     book was seen as anti-Tridentine, and in 1609 Historiae sui temporis was
     placed on the Roman Index. Despite the interdiction, Melchior Goldast, a
     scholar and literary agent in Frankfurt, joined bookseller Peter Kopf to
     publish a German edition, which they had printed in Offenbach to escape
     Frankfurt’s censorship. Their German edition restored material on the
     Council of Trent that had been cut and added marginalia that emphasized
     the anti-papal content.'® This illustrates how a single book might fare in
     different confessional locales.
      By the time Charles I came to the English throne in 1625 confessional
     differences had escalated into political crisis. The outbreak of the Thirty
     Years War provoked deep anti-Catholic sentiment among the majority of
     English Protestants, who, like archbishop George Abbot, leaned towards
     Calvinism. The King surrounded himself with court clerics, William Laud
     among them, who generously might be described as irenic — a wise policy,
     perhaps, since Charles’s queen, Henrietta Maria, and most of her household
     were Catholic. Shortly after Charles came to the throne, he issued a procla-

 Religion’ that differed from the doctrine and discipline of the Church of
 England.** The Calvinist majority, however, had a very different view from
 the Laudians at court about what constituted the English church’s doctrine
 and discipline. Where Laudians emphasized the common grounds between
 the English Church and Rome and adopted a liturgical style which resembled
 Roman Catholic worship, Calvinists declaimed against vestiges of
 Catholicism (such as venerating saints or bowing at Jesus’s name) and
 emphasized the necessity of ‘the Word truly preached’. The pre-print
 approval of books, entrusted to the chaplains of both the Bishop of London
 and the Archbishop of Canterbury, reflected these differences — and proble-
 matized print licensing since Laud, as Bishop of London, denied publication
 to Calvinist writers while Archbishop Abbot allowed it. When Laud became
 Archbishop, he refused licences for Calvinist books, but their printing con-
 tinued. Enterprising publishers simply avoided the ecclesiastical authorizers
 by reprinting previously licensed books. A 1627 edition of Calvinist preacher
 William Gouge’s sermons, for example, was printed without being submitted
 to the ecclesiastical authorizers because the individual sermons had been
 formerly printed and the printer/publisher thereby ‘owned’ the copy. Once
 a title had been entered in the Stationers’ Register, that title remained the
 printer’s property to be printed and reprinted at will. This had enormous
 implications since at the same time that Laudians were emphasizing liturgical
 beauty, restricting Calvinist preaching and refusing licences for Calvinist
 books, a cohesive godly Calvinist community’s spiritual identity was being
 nurtured by printing that was entirely legal — and yet subversive.
  Confessional identity was not the only ground on which authority and
 subversion were exercised. Every state and principality had regulations and
 laws that prohibited politically seditious writing and printing — although how
 this might be defined resided in special circumstances and changed from one
 local authority to the next. In Elizabethan England, for example, the Queen’s
 unmarried status and her refusal to designate an heir provoked considerable
 anxiety about the succession, which in turn led parliament to include writing,
 printing or publishing words about the succession in a statutory definition of
 sedition. In a world where politics was defined by monarchical (or even
 magisterial or civic) power, the matter of authority and subversion was fairly
 clear. Authority resided in the ruling power and subversion appeared in
 anything that denied or challenged that power. Only a few conflicts over
 books extended beyond state boundaries — but in those that did, their wide-
 spread dissemination demonstrates the difficulty in containing subversion. In

     advanced the Spanish Infanta’s claim to the English succession by denying
     Tudor legitimacy and by advancing elaborate legal and theological justifica-
     tions for depriving a ruler. Lord Burghley, Elizabeth I’s chief minister, knew in
     advance of the book’s publication but was unsuccessful at preventing its
     circulation both in England and abroad. While the Conference’s interest in
     the English succession might be seen as subversive only to Elizabeth’s author-
      ity, it was part of a wider conversation about political resistance going on
     throughout Europe.
       In 1579 Vindiciae, contra tyrannos, purportedly by Stephano Junio (actu-
      ally by the French Huguenot, Philippe de Plessis Mornay), was printed in
      Basel. Almost immediately it was reprinted and republished in French and
     Dutch, as well as its original Latin. The same year a Latin edition appeared in
     England with the imprint ‘Edinburgi’, and a year later another Latin edition
     appeared in England imprinted simply ‘printed abroad’. Born of the French
     wars of religion and grounded in both Roman Law and Judeo-Christian
      scripture, the Vindiciae contended that in response to natural law’s dictates
     and in order to preserve common humanity, anyone must be willing to use
      force to combat political tyranny. Although authorities across Europe sought
      the text’s suppression (James I had copies burned in 1622), this became a
     foundational text of resistance theory with other books adopting its argu-
     ments, including George Buchanan’s De jure regni apud Scotos, printed in
     Edinburgh with royal privilege in 1579, and Juan de Mariana’s De rege et
      regis institutione libre (Toledo, 1599).** A 1580 edition of Buchanan’s
     De jure, surreptitiously printed in Antwerp by G. van den Rade, had on its
      title page: ‘Ad exemplar Ioannis Rossei. Edinburgi, cum priuilegio Scotorum
      Regis’. The next year two London printers, Thomas Dawson and Edward
     Aggas, issued a surreptitious edition with the same title-page imprint. Besides
      their monarchomach views, these books reveal multiple subversive strategies.
     Their Latin editions were accessible to readers across national boundaries,
     which allowed widespread dissemination. They cleverly used patronage and
      privilege. Mariana’s book was written as a counsel book for Philip III of
     Spain; even though it lacked a royal printing privilege it had the King’s
     support. In 1605 Andre Wechel printed editions in Mainz and Frankfurt,
     with privileges. In 1611 Wechel editions appeared in both Mainz and Paris,
     and the French edition, published in association with the privileged press at
     the seminary at St Sulpice, carried the King’s privilege (an interesting afterlife
      for a book the Parlement of Paris had burned on 8 June 1610). Buchanan was
      tutor to James VI of Scotland (later James I of England), so the royal privilege
      for the Scottish publication is unexceptional. Clearly, however, the book was
     perceived to be dangerous enough in both Antwerp and London to require

          as a strategy to deflect attention from the book’s subversive
 argument. Even though the Vindiciae was printed in centres sympathetic to its
 Huguenot origins — Basel, Strasbourg, Geneva, possibly London (‘printed
 abroad’) — the absence of publishers’ names (or Basel’s false ‘Edinburgi’) on
 their title pages defied authorities. Conference about the Next Succession’s
 title page does the same by claiming to have been ‘licensed’ but offering only
 ‘N’ as its place of publication.
  These immensely popular books that openly advocated resistance theory
 highlight the principal problem for controlling subversive books. Notoriety
 could increase demand, and sufficient demand offered a motive for publish-
 ers, printers and booksellers (perhaps also smugglers) to risk evading the
 highly complicated and often contradictory regulatory systems that were in
 place across Europe. Subversion, it seems, was uncontrollable and, indeed,
 inescapable beyond very narrow local boundaries — even for a monarch, as
 James I’s effort to control books printed outside of England attests. In 1610
 when the English ambassador, Henry Wooton, discussed with the Venetian
 Cabinet a printed libel that had referred to Venice as a ‘corpse’ and James as ‘a
 crow that settled on it’, he told them that he did not wish the book suppressed
 ‘so as not to give it importance or cause it to be sought’.’? In another case,
 James unsuccessfully sought the suppression of Corona Regia (1615), a book
 offering a stinging mock encomium of his pretensions. James’s agents’ search
 for the book’s author and printer was relentless, and when found, James
 asked the Belgian Archduke to punish the book’s makers. The Archduke
 refused, and subsequently an English ship seized one of the Archduke’s.
 One observer noted that some were ‘inclined to suspect that this is His
 Majesty’s way of showing his resentment at the Archduke’s reluctance to
 punish the authors and printers of Corona Regia’."*
  The example of James’s putative act of retaliatory piracy for his own failed
 effort to exert control over another authority who refused to exert control
 over a printed book, epitomizes the complex interplay of authorities and
 subversions being considered here. It also raises the question of another
 kind of authority — that of the book itself. Adrian Johns argues that in the
 sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, print had a problem of credit with read-
 ers. ‘If an early modern reader picked up a printed book’, Johns imagines,
 ‘then he or she could not be immediately certain that it was what it claimed to
 be’. One reason for this, he says, was piracy; the other that ‘illicit uses of the
 press threatened the credibility of all printed books’. Johns here maintains
 that the very conditions of subversive texts and subversive printing practices
 that have been considered here [led ] [to ] [a ] [second ] [order ] [of ][subversion ] [— ] [that ] [of ]

     scientific knowledge. He argues that it was not until the Royal Society
     established a means to protect authorship and establish authorial control
     over printed texts that the ‘advent of fixity’ arrived.*’ Once this happened,
     printing could repair the problem of credit and only then could printing be
     seen as possessing authority. Johns is countering Elizabeth Eisenstein’s con-
     tention that the printed text’s essential nature — its fixity (uniformity and
     synchronization) — produced the enormous cultural shift that took place in
     sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Europe, which included the Renaissance,
     the Reformation, the Copernican Revolution and the birth of science. Since
     1979, when Eisenstein’s The Printing Press as an Agent of Change responded
      to a perceived historiographical problem (that ‘the effects produced by print-
     ing have aroused little controversy, not because views on the topic coincide,
     but because almost none have been set forth in an explicit and systematic
     form’) historians of the book have expanded, mediated and qualified
     Eisenstein’s sweeping arguments. *°
      Besides Johns, who moved the fixity of printing — or at least scientific
     printing — forward nearly two hundred years, scholars have reconsidered
     the impact of printing on scholarly communities, politics, the arts and even
     the Reformation. Many of Eisenstein’s assessments of printing’s significant
     cultural implications have stood, albeit sometimes modified. Andrew
     Pettegree and Matthew Hall, for example, have demonstrated that in
    Germany where printing was dispersed across a wide area, inexpensive and
     easy to produce religious tracts and vernacular books made economic sense,
     and their production impacted the Reformation. However, in countries where
     printing was concentrated in one or two large cities and in well-capitalized,
     established printing houses, printing had little influence on religious reform. ‘7
     With regard to printing’s impact on learning, Ian Maclean agrees with
     Eisenstein that printing led to an increase in new areas of learning, including
     natural philosophy and the literature of discovery, and that ‘this increase
     allowed for a broader range of views to achieve dissemination’. Maclean,
     however, goes beyond the early sixteenth-century humanist-publishers to
     consider the challenges posed by confessionalism and an increasingly satu-
     rated market for learned books. Even so, he observes that the new merchant/
     publishers still supported scholarship and sought ‘to ensure that the texts they
     produced were of the best quality possible’. Like Pettegree and Hall, Maclean
     attends to the economic realities printers and publishers faced, and also in
     facing these realities, the resort of some to piracy, but, unlike Johns, he does
     not see this as undermining the authority of the book. Instead, Maclean sees
     printers enhancing the book’s authority and marketability through features
     of the text, since a book’s physical features mattered to authors and editors,

       (in cases) a generous format size, for their works. These act

  Texts, then, could exert considerable authority — or, conversely, they could
 employ strategies to disguise their authority, as when Vindiciae, contra
 tyrannos appeared in octavo, a format, Anne McLaren reminds us, contem-
 poraries associated with cheap and insignificant texts. "?
  McLaren’s attention to formal properties speaks to Roger Chartier’s obser-
 vations about print which began this chapter — that the proliferation in print
 of ephemeral texts diminished the authority of the book, and, implicitly,
 diminished all authority. What is telling about Chartier’s remarks is that the
 authoritative nature of the printed word is taken for granted. Both McLaren
 and Mclean remind us that by the end of the sixteenth century printers and
 publishers were sufficiently sophisticated to adapt the paratextual elements of
 their products to specific ends. In the case of some texts, rapid, cheap and
 careless printing either mattered little or made no pretense to textual author-
 ity. One example illustrates this, the English Martin Marprelate tracts. The
 seven pamphlets, containing witty and satiric diatribes against the English
 bishops and the established church, appeared between 1588 and 1589 froma
 secret printing press that was moved from place to place in the English
 countryside to escape the authorities. Everything about them flouted printing
 conventions. Their author (or authors) repudiated his own authority by
 taking the pseudonym of Marprelate. The title pages joked about the requisite
 naming of printer and place of publication, as when that of Hay any work for
 Cooper read, ‘Penned and compiled by Martin the Metropolitan: Printed in
 Europe, not farre from some of the Bounsing Priests’. The first three tracts
 were in quarto format, the rest octavo, and all were badly printed on poor
 quality paper. Everything about these tracts — the material books and their
 contents — was subversive.
  By the late sixteenth century, as the Marprelate example suggests, notions of
 textual authority resided in something more than the idea of ‘fixity’ so central
 to the arguments of Eisenstein and Johns: books could be imperfect yet invoke
 authority. Aldus Manutius sought a reputation for being an accurate and
 informed editor of Roman and Greek authors. Indeed, as Malcolm Lowry
 points out, ‘he made something of a fetish of the precision and accuracy of his
 texts’.*° The authority Aldus’s scholarly publications possessed among con-
 temporary humanists is confirmed by Erasmus, who in an early letter to Aldus
 wrote, ‘I should think my studies had received the gift of immortality,
 if they saw the light of day printed in your types’.*" Even so, Aldus had to
 append correction lists to some [of ][his ][books. ] [Erasmus’s ] [Novum ] [Instrumentum, ]

```
     Instrumentum, which quickly became an authoritative exemplar for Biblical
     scholarship and translation, served as a textual foundation for the burgeoning
     industry of bible translation and publication. Even so, the Novum
     Instrumentum had errors that its hurried printing at John Froben’s press left
     uncorrected. And Froben was not a careless publisher. A contemporary
     reported that Froben favoured the costly option of repeating a day’s work
     rather than allow a single error in a book he was printing.*? Such concern for
     accuracy extended across the world of scholarly publication in the sixteenth
     and seventeenth centuries, with the well-respected publishing houses employ-
     ing ‘as many as three, four, or even more correctors’, all of whom were the
     highest paid workers in the print shop.** Yet, piracy did exist; Lyon printers
     notoriously reprinted Aldine classical quartos. Such books, though, may not
     have had flawed texts, but if they did, their purchasers should have known.
     After all, as Froben asserted, ‘a man who buys a good book at a high price gets
      a bargain, while someone who buys a bad book cheaply makes a loss’.*°
      Humanist interest in accurately transmitting, first, classical texts and later,
     books of humanist scholarship points to their faith in print’s authority well
     before the time Johns allowed. The issue here concerns what constituted knowl-
     edge. If, as Johns defines it, knowledge is knowledge only when it is verifiable
     and replicable (science), then, yes, Johns is right. The problem lies in what
     sixteenth- and seventeenth-century readers regarded as knowledge. Besides
      their interest in classical literature, theology and religion represented an impor-
     tant category of knowledge, and from early in the sixteenth century, scholars
     submitted religious texts, including scripture and the writings of the early
     Church fathers to the same kind of critical textual scrutiny that humanists
     applied to the classics. Major publishing houses, including Froben, Estienne
      in Paris and Plantin in Antwerp published the early church fathers — not the least
     of which was Erasmus’s edition of St Jerome. Eisenstein was correct in noting
     the interest in natural history and the care that was given to preparing these
      texts for the press. The latter half of the sixteenth century saw the beginning of a
     similar interest in national history, which produced books like de Thou’s
     Historiae sui temporis (Paris: Drouart, 1609) and William Camden’s
     Britannia (London: Ralph Newbery, 1587), both printed with great care.
     George Bishop’s 1590 Camden edition bore the royal arms on its title page,
     an even greater mark of authority than the notice of privilege, ‘cum gratia and
     privilegio regiae maiestatis’, which appeared in both the 1587 and 1590 edi-
      tions. While modern historians may dismiss the historiographical methods of
     the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, these early historians saw themselves as
     striving for historical accuracy, and their books possessed considerable author-
      ity. Authors in many areas of learning sought such respect, but not everything

                                    science,
 it ‘also disseminated much nonsense, particularly in the realm of medicine and
 astronomy. Print can disseminate error as much as truth.’*°
  In matters of print authority, then, the challenge in studies of the history of
 the book has been to find a comfortable middle ground between sweeping
 historical generalizations about print culture and narrow but valuable close
 bibliographical analysis. Printing, for example, may not have caused the
 Reformation — but in some places certain printed books did advance it.
 Likewise, printing may have given greater fixity than manuscripts — and
 with some kinds of books a high degree of fixity may be found — but anyone
 who has wrestled with textual problems inherent in early-modern books
 (Shakespeare’s plays, for example) recognizes the complicated relationship
 between authoritative meaning and the printed text. Did Hamlet desire that
 his too ‘sullied’ or too ‘solid’ flesh would melt? Or did Othello liken himself to
 the ‘base Indian’ or ‘base Judean’ who ‘threw a pearl away richer than all his
 tribe’? Do these differences necessarily subvert textual authority? The rela-
 tionship between subversion and authority needs to be seen not as antithetical
 but as interdependent. To illustrate what this might mean in relationship to
 early-modern books, the remainder of this chapter focuses on a sixteenth-
 century English book: the second edition of Rafael Holinshed’s Chronicles of
 England Scotland and Ireland (1587).
  Until recently Holinshed’s Chronicles enjoyed little credit from scholars
 interested in either early English printing or early English historiography. One
 of the problems is the variability among extant editions — the lack of fixity.
 Although it has long been known that censorship of the three-volume work
 (usually bound in two volumes) led to the presence of cancel leaves in both
 volumes, variations in cancels and the irregularity of their actually replacing
 censored text has often led to the view that the book reflected shoddy printing
 practices. The mere fact of censorship has also been seen as an assault on the
 book’s authority. In Reading Holinshed’s Chronicles, Annabel Patterson sees
 anxiety about censorship as central both to evasive publication strategies and
 to the project’s larger protocols. According to Patterson ‘the publication of
 both editions of the Chronicles suggests, if not scofflawry, at least a degree of
 circumvention of the regulation’: the publishers evaded the requirement for
 preprint licensing and for entering the licence in the Stationers’ Registers
 immediately following that review.”” Furthermore, the Chronicles’ principal
 interests lay in telling stories of freedom of speech denied and punished and in
 doing so was inherently subversive. [Actually, ] [the ] [licensing, ] [printing ] [and ]
 censorship tell a quite different story.

    ‘Polychronicon’, which he and Holinshed worked on for twenty-five years.
    The project was incomplete in 1573 when Wolfe died. A year later when his
     wife Joan followed him, her will provided the means for Holinshed to receive
     the ‘benefit proffit and commoditie’ of the Chronicle. Her executor, together
    with members of her family and of Wolfe’s printing house, published the first
     edition. They employed as printer Henry Bynneman, a recognized craftsman
     with experience printing histories. In 1580 the earl of Leicester and Sir
    Christopher Hatton would secure for Bynneman a royal privilege to print
     ‘all Dictionaries in all tongues, all Chronicles and histories whatsoever’.
    Ralph Newbery and Henry Denham, who acquired Bynneman’s patent
     after his death in 1583, planned a second edition of the Chronicles, and on
     6 October 1584, together with the surviving publishers of the 1577 edition (or
     their assignees), entered in the Stationers’ Register their licence ‘to print
    Holinshed’s Cronicle in folio’. This entry reflected and recorded the change
     in partnership shares that had occurred after the 1577 edition and was not, as
     Patterson suggests, an attempt to obtain a licence before the troublesome
     additions to the 1577 text were completed. On 30 December 1584 Henry
    Denham and Ralph Newbery entered their ‘license and allowance ... by the
    queene maiesties graunte’ to print dictionaries and histories. This notice of
     royal privilege contained a list of eight titles, headed by Holinshed’s
     Chronicles.** When the second edition appeared in 1587, its colophon indi-
     cated that Henry Denham printed it ‘cum privilegio’.
      Besides appearing under the authority of royal privilege, the 1587
     Chronicles conveyed textual authority, printed in three volumes in large-
     folio format gathered in six. Denham, approaching the printing with con-
     siderable seriousness and care, placed the project in the hands of Abraham
     Fleming (BA Cambridge 1580), a poet, translator and ‘learned corrector’
     often employed in his printing house.*? Fleming worked on the Holinshed
     revision between 1585 and 1587. One of his most important tasks was
    extending to the present the 1577 Chronicles’ account of Elizabeth’s reign;
     the other was editing the entire text. He imposed a more discerning paragraph
     structure; created an episodic structure by inserting responsive editorial com-
     ments, Latin epigrams and transitions; extended and improved the 1577
     edition’s printed marginalia; and created detailed indexes. Perhaps one of
     Fleming’s most remarkable tasks was proofreading the entire 1587 edition.
    As a complete set of bound proof sheets at the Huntington Library attests, this
    was clearly directed at producing a typographically excellent text. The com-
     bination of the royal privilege and the printed text’s quality lends consider-
     able authority to the 1587 Chronicles.

 England ... until they shall be reviewed and reformyd’. The concern was
 not with the Chronicles themselves but with the recent additions made ‘as an
 augmentation to Hollingsheades Chronicle’ that contained ‘sondry thinges
 which we wish had bene better considered, forasmuch as the same booke doth
 allso conteyne reporte of matters of later yeeres that concern the State, and are
 not therfore meete to be published in such sorte as they are delyvered’.?° The
 order appointed reviewers experienced in those State matters that warranted
 ‘reformation’. The text was censored in three stages, the first of which called
 for deletions and revisions in the Scottish history, and in the English history’s
 accounts of Campion’s trial and Leicester’s campaign in the Low Countries.
 At the second stage a history of all the archbishops of Canterbury was cut,
 probably by the current archbishop. The final stage shows careful editing
 designed to influence international and domestic opinions about English
 justice. This was probably as an effort to contain negative reactions to
 Mary Queen of Scots’ execution and to address concerns about a shift from
 a military to a diplomatic solution in the Low Countries.?”
  The cancel sheets for the Chronicles are extraordinary in that Fleming
 composed them to maintain the narrative’s integrity. Where it was feasible
 to eliminate long passages inessential to the history, they were cut, most likely
 to ensure a timely revision and to save labour and paper costs. To this end,
 long antiquarian lineages of the Cobham and Leicester families and of the
 lords chancellor and wardens of the Cinque Ports were removed. Most of the
 time, however, Fleming left the sequence of events intact, even as he con-
 densed some accounts or removed offending material in others. For example,
 he kept the government trial of Edmund Campion for treason, but eliminated
 reports that Campion’s supporters ‘bruited about’ that he was tried for
 religion and not for politics. He condensed the adjacent description of the
 duc d’Alencon’s departure from England to avoid offending the Dutch.
 Fleming also changed the tone of some passages, as, for example, when he
 softened the fiercely anti-Catholic language used for the trial and execution of
 the Babington conspirators who had plotted against Queen Elizabeth.
 Fleming created such textual continuity between the uncensored printed
 page and the cancels that censorship would be undetectable were it not for
 the interruptions in pagination and signatures.

     the book not possessed authority, it might have been ignored. The Chronicles
     also testify to a printed text’s potential for textual instability. Although this
     instability derived from censorship and revision, it was also created by
     practices in the printing house where offending leaves were irregularly
    removed (or not removed at all) and where three sets of cancel leaves were
    produced and irregularly introduced. Even with all this, the 1587 edition of
    Holinshed’s Chronicles has exerted considerable cultural authority since it
     served as the historical basis for more than a generation of poets and play-
     wrights, including, of course, Shakespeare.**
     The instances of authority and subversion considered here suggest that in
    early-modern Europe printed books acquired so much authority that they
    became instrumental to the exercise of political, religious and even cultural
    power at the same time as they became subject to that power. Traditionally
     the language of authority and subversion belongs to the realm of these kinds
     of power, but in studies of the history of the book, the language of authority
    and subversion accrues to the texts themselves, both in their material proper-
     ties and in their contents. The habit of mind that juxtaposes authority and
     subversion in the political, religious and cultural realms causes us to envision
     the antitheses to textual fixity, stability and continuity as some form of
     subversion. This, however, is not entirely the case with books — that is, not
     with individual books. So many of the examples of individual books consid-
     ered here (not the least of which being Holinshed’s 1587 Chronicles) call
    upon us to refine our understanding of authorities and subversions and to see
    them not as antithetical but as coexistent and interdependent. Subversion
    depends on some form of authority — textual, paratextual or magisterial. This
     applies even to libel, the kind of writing that since Roman times was seen as
     inherently subversive. It is hard to imagine that libelling a common murderer
     or thief would matter at all; libel becomes subversive only when directed at
     those with religious, political or economic power. Similarly, in the early
    modern period, authorities would not have cared much about what was
     printed if they had not regarded the printed book as possessing authority.
    What is telling about the examples of authority and subversion considered
     here is that it was the printed text’s authority that led princes and princi-
     palities to both promote and restrict printing — often simultaneously. Ironically
     the means taken by institutions to impose their authority became so fixed that
     entrepreneurial printers easily developed strategies of subversion.
     The challenge of book history is to make sense of this complex interplay of
     authorities and subversions, and this is a challenge that perhaps cannot be
     fully met. The problem lies in the fact that, as we have seen here, so much of
     the evidence comes from copies of individual books and, as Joseph Dane

```

```
 problems any book or group of books poses will always challenge such
 narratives’.** In terms, then, of a narrative of authority and subversion in
 early-modern Europe perhaps the best that can be done is to account for the
 multiple authorities which printed texts might claim (or that might claim
 them) and to recognize the inevitable intrusion upon these authorities by
 the subversions of individual books.

             JAMES RAVEN
  The industrial revolution of the book
 Until the early nineteenth century, all book and print production processes in
 all parts of the world succeeded or failed as a result of manual labour. Hands,
 not powered machines, engraved wood blocks and plates, cut punches and
 cast, composed and inked type. Hands worked paper mills and different kinds
 of xylography and letter-press, using many different sorts of material. Hands
 hung drying paper and silk, and bound the products. Across Europe, men and
 women lived and often suffered from the making of lead-based type and rag-
 based paper and from the exertions of pulling the letter- and rolling presses.
 Many operatives worked in small, hot and unpleasant printing rooms. In
 all parts of the world, eyes as well as hands suffered from the demands of
 microscopic cutting and refining of wood blocks and copper and other metal
 plates.
  Unlike the coming of print (wood blocks in second-century East Asia and
 thirteenth-century Europe; moveable type in eleventh-century China and
 fifteenth-century Europe), the second mechanized, industrial revolution in
 book production was experienced worldwide in one century. It was, none-
 theless, hugely variable in its regional adoption and impact. This nineteenth-
 century transformation has been identified with publishing capitalism, and
 yet its history is many-faceted, with complicated antecedents. Technological
 bravura led the revolution, its products sometimes dismissed as industrial
 literature. Thomas Carlyle (and cultural pessimists around the globe)
 denounced the new machinery as mechanizing minds, devaluing literature
 and learning, and replacing craftsmanship (in writing as well as in publishing)
 by the robotic and the mass-produced. The unprecedented cheapness of
 industrially printed materials encouraged more people to read but also
 developed a greater sense of the indeterminacy and anonymity of the reading
 public.
  Periodization of this transformation remains problematic. Many historians

     about 1750 by reproducing popular works whose protected printing privi-
      leges had expired. The Société Typographique de Neuchatel undertook vast
     reprinting activities, and (among others) the London printing firms of Samuel
     Richardson and of William and Andrew Strahan introduced a greater indus-
      trial process to the expanding book trades. Such firms typify the broad
     commercialisation and development of a consumer culture associated with
     eighteenth-century Britain and western Europe and the enterprise of new
     manufacturers such as Josiah Wedgwood the potter and Matthew Boulton
     and James Watt, the makers of popular metal goods. Certainly, the increased
     output and building expansion of several London, then Paris and Leipzig, and
      later New York and Boston printing houses was remarkable, far outstripping
      the overall capacity of their forebears where one printing press had been the
     norm and two unusual. Nevertheless the achievements of the eighteenth
     century must be measured against the concentrated activity of early centres
     of printing such as those of the Aldine press of Aldus Manutius in Venice, of
      the Officina Plantiniana of the Plantin-Moretus family in Antwerp and the
     Kobergers in Seville. These, and many others, commanded numerous presses.
     The Plantin printing house comprised, at its peak, sixteen presses in 1574 and
     up to a dozen between the 1620s and 1730s." The limitations of the manual
     printing press remained, however. Concurrent printing enabled a certain
      efficiency of scale, but the productivity of each printing press remained
     much the same.
       Just as critical as the technologies of printing and engraving were the
     changing productive relationships between printers, publishers and the
     broader structure of the book trades. This was especially so in Europe and
      its colonies. By the eighteenth century, most stationers were viewed as
     paper suppliers and most printers as the clients (and in their own despairing
     words ‘mere mechanicks’) of publishing booksellers. The originating finance
     remained fundamental to the manufacturing chain from writer to reader,
      its links maintained by financiers, whether printers, self-publishing authors,
     merchants or wholesale and literary-property owning booksellers. Publishers
      assisted in the development of advertising, the creation of demand and the
     exploitation of expanding distributive and transport methods, from travelling
      carriers, postal services, coaches, wagons and marine and (eventually) rail
     networks. Even in publishing, however, bookselling careers operated under
     constraints imposed by broader resource limitations.
      Across all trades in the early-modern world from Asia to Europe, most fixed
      capital had been invested in ways that produced only indirect gain. In western
     Europe, with the development of fixed-site production and selling, the property

 and many were sub-tenants) offered no long-term investment. Raw materials
 and goods comprised the essentials of long-term business investment. By
 modern standards, productivity rates stayed low. Excessive reliance on (man-
 ual) labour and a vast reservoir of under-employment created little inducement
 for cost-reducing innovations in all trades and industries. With so much capital
 tied up in a specific item of production (an edition) before any of it could be sold
 to realize returns, the publishing sector was especially handicapped. The book
 trades further suffered from the relatively inefficient deployment of resources
 that economists now term ‘path dependency’, that is, the continuation of
 working practices that were technically flexible but hidebound by cultural
 inertia. As a result, the bringing of new money into the trades, and its more
 versatile exploitation, are all the more striking. The transformation of the book
 trades in the nineteenth century can be found here: the breaking of an earlier
 economic regime that allowed only low productivity rates, with particularly
 high labour-intensity.
  The expansion of printing and book production did not occur evenly
 worldwide, or even within Europe. Different countries and regions responded
 to what have been called their own book trade rhythms.” Centralization
 affected some states more than others. In France, Lyon provided short-lived
 independence as an early publishing and distributive centre, but the tradi-
 tionally dominant Paris supported most publishing during the eighteenth
 century and its supremacy was even more concentrated during the next two
 hundred years. Mechanization served to enhance the centrality of Madrid in
 the Spanish publishing industry, but also created a powerful new urban
 printing centre in Barcelona by the end of the nineteenth century. By contrast,
 the states of Germany, the Low Countries and Italy boasted a number of
 important, interconnected distributive centres, including Venice, Frankfurt
 and Antwerp. In Germany Frankfurt and Leipzig were rivalled by Stuttgart,
 Munich and Berlin. England and later Ireland (but not Scotland) bore more
 resemblance to the single metropolitan model of France. This model differed
 again to that of early-modern China where Jiagnan, the region immediately
 south of the lower reaches of the Yangtze, became the central clearing-house
 in the empire. Jiagnan published more books than any other area and des-
 patched them to Beijing and other far-flung cities. Even so, nothing like the
 national dominance of London (or indeed Paris) existed in China until, with
 the development of mechanized printing, Shanghai gained unquestionable
 ascendancy.’
  In France and England, the economic publishing and distributive domi-
 nance of the capital ensured that rivals struggled to compete; such supremacy

      publishers from all over England and - especially during the eighteenth
      century — a remarkable injection of Scottish flair and audacity that trans-
     formed the trade. Edinburgh, Dublin (at least before 1800) and Glasgow
     developed important book export businesses, but London remained the main
     publishing source for the books, magazines and other print sent out to the
      British provinces and then to the colonies in North America, the Caribbean,
      India, the US, Africa, Australasia and the Far East. In almost all of these
      places, local feeder networks distributed the centrally produced publications
      but also added their own local (usually jobbing) productions. In addition,
     second-hand and antiquarian book distribution greatly increased in volume
     and complexity, as did access to books and print. Libraries — private, institu-
      tional and commercial — all had celebrated pedigrees, but all came of age in
      the nineteenth century (even though the definition of what a ‘library’ was
      varied hugely around the world).
                 Technological revolution
      In the eighteenth century, technological progress had been a limited force in
      the book trades, restricted to typefounding and design, and to a lesser extent
      to paper manufacture and experiments with intaglio techniques and the roll-
      ing press. The first successful lithography, using paper laid upon a drawing
     made in lithographic chalk on a damp stone, dates from the work of the Czech
      Alois Senefelder in Germany in 1798.* Thin India paper arrived in Europe in
     about 1750; coated paper and transparent paper were patented in 1827.
     From the early nineteenth century, technical and mechanical improvements
     made printing, papermaking, bookbinding and transportation cheaper and
      faster in Europe and North America. By contrast, Japanese interest in letter-
      press printing declined in favour of traditional wood-block xylography,
     although greater efficiencies were also introduced. In China, by the end of
      the nineteenth century, a revolution in production processes akin to those in
     Europe had transformed the productive capacity and commercial market of
       its much older book and printing trades.
      Steam-driven machinery, following Watt’s British patent for a steam engine
      in 1781, shattered technological constraints in weaving, spinning and the
     production of machine tools (among other applications), but the book trades
     were not similarly transformed until after 1814. Nicholas-Louis Robert
     patented a papermaking machine at the paper mill of Didot Saint Leger in
     Essonnes, France. Mechanized papermaking first became commercially
      viable in 1807 with machines made by Henry and Sealy Fourdrinier in
     London, but throughout the century local stationers commonly complained

               first grass straw and then wood pulp.
By 1825 half of all paper in England was manufactured by machine, with
total output increasing thirty-fold between 1820 and 1900. In the final third
of the nineteenth century, papermaking costs were reduced by about two-
thirds.>
  For the publishers of Europe and the Americas, the nineteenth century
might be said to begin in 1814, the year in which a steam-driven press first
printed The Times in London. The replacement of the manual printing press
shattered the principal technological shackles of three and a half centuries of
printed publication by moveable type in Europe and of the far more ancient
printing activities of East Asia. The long quest to improve the wooden print-
ing press, to reduce manual effort and to increase productivity, culminated in
successful experiments with an all-metal lever press at the very end of the
eighteenth century, but it took a further decade to produce an effective
alternative to the hand-operated press. Following Earl Stanhope’s experi-
ments with an iron press in 1800 (and various successful initiatives in using
stereotyped plates), George Clymer (an American of Swiss origins) patented
the Columbia iron press in 1817. Soon after Clymer’s arrival in England his
press was rivalled by the British Albion press. The key development, however,
was mechanization, now enabled by the greater stability of the iron press.
Frederick Koenig first patented a power-driven platen screw-press in 1810,
but his further patent of 1814 featured a machine with an inking roller, cast-
iron platen and, crucially, an impression cylinder. Koenig adapted the cylin-
der from a patent of 1790 by William Nicholson, until it could print up to
1,100 sheets an hour compared to 300 under the iron hand press.° Colour
printing also became more widespread after 1800 with various experiments
in oil-based ink application and diverse methods, including the advance of
chromolithography at mid-century. By that time, publishers also commis-
sioned the first experiments in photographic insertions.
 Stereotyping of composed type gradually increased from the late 1820s (led
by notable exponents such as the French printer Firmin Didot of Essonnes
who is credited with naming the process). The process, using plaster moulds,
reduced the wear on type and enabled the keeping of the stereotyped plates
instead of huge quantities of expensive and cumbersome standing type. In
about 1820, London supported twelve establishments for the casting of
stereotype plates. In 1848, type was fixed on a cylinder instead of a flat bed,
enabling the number of impressions per hour to increase to as many as
12,000. From the 1850s papier maché and then plate-metal moulds further
transformed stereotyping techniques. The first industrial binding machines

     and materials also changed. In 1834, John Murray II of London, to take just
      one example, reissued Thomas Macklin’s lavishly illustrated bible with steel-
      engraved plates, a process that reduced costs and offered striking new design
      possibilities.
       The automation of punch-cutting, typecasting and composition produced a
      further technological leap in the nineteenth century. Typecasting machines
      invented in the US in 1838 proved capable of casting 6,000 pieces of type an
      hour. This rose to over 50,000 pieces an hour by the end of the century.
      Rotary printing presses developed from about 1865 and linotype and mono-
      type systems in the 1890s. In 1885, the American Linn Boyd Benton mechan-
      ized punch cutting by the pantographic machine, and in the same year Ottmar
     Merganthaler, a German-American, introduced Linotype, combining the
      casting and composing of type in a single line. A rival Monotype machine
      cast and composed individual pieces of type. Industrial binding and pack-
      aging similarly advanced, with great economies of scale in such factories as
     Reclam in Leipzig and Mame in Tours. In some states normally sidelined in
      general book trade histories, new establishments gained international status.
      In Hungary for example, the Pallas Literary and Printing Company was
     founded in 1884 with a typefoundry, lithographic press, bindery and rotary
      and intaglio printing presses on the same site. Hakubunkan Shinsha, founded
      in 1887 in Yumi, now part of Tokyo, spearheaded the redevelopment of
      printing by metal moveable type in Japan, and from one integrated and
     mechanized publishing site.
      We need, nonetheless, to be cautious about dividing a modern from an
      ancient book trade at the point that power-driven machinery first printed a
     newspaper in London. The take-off in publication volume in western Europe
      from the 1740s reflected the entrepreneurial initiatives of publishing book-
      sellers, most of whom now left the printing to dedicated printers. The take-off
      resulted from the expansion of capital resources and increased middle-class,
      provincial and institutional demand. Publishers and booksellers promoted
      significant change in the decades immediately before 1814. Many ancient
      firms continued and adapted, but many others struggled to survive. Across
      Europe, and especially in Britain, greater productivity resulted from financial
      and organizational innovation, within a trading structure fractured by new-
     comer booksellers with their cheap reprints and other innovations in sales-
     manship and product design. Large, powerful publishers invested in literary
      properties (with variable protection in different countries). In France a new
      legal interpretation of copyright protection in 1778 was strengthened after
      the Revolution in 1793. Although such directives proved fitful, leading
      Austrian publishers benefited from further protection in 1832, as did their

                    this publishing history, while control, by
 the agents of local and national government, remained both a restraint and a
 stimulus.
  Political and financial control must not be underplayed: the legal con-
 straints of many European governments continued to maintain barriers to
 the social extension of knowledge and education. Social reaction ranged from
 elite criticism in France and England to popular condemnation of die Lesewut
 (or reading craze) in Germany. Suspicion of machinery had accounted for the
 revival of xylography in Japan, and created resistance to change in China in
 the late nineteenth century. Governments adapted such reaction to fiscal
 advantage, as governments are prone to do. The Riancey amendment in
 France represented a form of taxation on fiction from 1850, and censorship
 measures followed in Portugal, Austria and some Italian states. By contrast,
 two generations or so after challenges to copyright legislation in Britain,
 punitive taxation on paper and advertisements was successively lifted and
 state censorship relaxed in France after the 1830 July Revolution.
  In such ways, the 1814 divide is undermined by the continuation of many
 structural features of the early-modern and eighteenth-century trade through
 the 1820s and beyond. Printers did not speedily adopt Koenig’s new steam
 press. Not until the 1820s did many publications issue from what The Times
 itself called ‘the greatest improvement connected with printing since the
 discovery of the art itself’. Country book and newspaper printers often
 retained the old wooden or Stanhope iron presses.
  In many respects, the 1840s marked a clearer transition from one age of
 bookselling to the next. The industrial, mass production of books accelerated
 after the mid-nineteenth century, and few of the older practices remained
 visible. The modifications to the Koenig press promoted by Edward Cowper
 and Augustus Applegarth streamlined production still further. One of their
 later eight-cylinder presses attracted large crowds at the London Great
 Exhibition of 1851.° More tellingly, the mid-nineteenth-century British tus-
 sles over taxation on books, paper and advertising fuelled passionate argu-
 ment about the future of publishing and bookselling. Similar resistance to
 copyright, patent and grants of privilege extended to negotiation (and trans-
 gression) of international, cross-border agreements in the next fifty years. The
 law and the assertiveness of guilds and privilege- and property-owning
 groups seemed to steer transitional moments in the book industry. In the
 Netherlands, for example, a new institute was founded in 1815 to succeed the

     matters, and highlight the crucial agency of individual entrepreneurs and
      lobbyists. William Hutton, founder of the first circulating library in
     Birmingham, is typical of those who tested boundaries and helped define
     moments of change in the nineteenth century. In his prime the richest
     English stationer, bookseller and papermaker outside London, Hutton epi-
     tomised the age in which the book merchant (according to the puff for his
     1841 autobiography) ‘had risen to opulence and eminence by force of his
      merits alone’.? In 1826 Louis Hachette established his Paris publishing house,
      principally issuing educational manuals and journals, dictionaries of modern
     and ancient languages, and modestly priced but exactingly edited versions of
     French, Latin and Greek classics. Hachette’s ‘railway library’, publications
      for reading on the train, paralleled that of W. H. Smith in Britain. Railway
     extension boosted all levels of distribution, developing for books and journals
     what amounted to a new stage of opportunity in book and print production,
     marketing, distribution and reception. Railways created new markets as well
      as supplying existing ones, progressing steadily during the 1840s. Hachette’s
     publications and W. H. Smith’s bookstalls supplied long-distance passengers
     and those travelling regularly to work. Both firms helped to popularize read-
      ing in trains, where it was much easier than in horse-drawn coaches.
       Circulations were impressive. Hachette’s Le Journal pour tous, founded in
      1855, gained a weekly circulation of 150,000 copies. Just as national circula-
      tion increased in Britain, leading firms such as Longmans and Macmillan,
     together with the university presses of Oxford and Cambridge, hugely
     extended their international dealings, requiring extensive investment and
      high-risk credit development. Henry S. King, brother-in-law of the ‘prince
      of publishers’, George Smith, developed the firm that was to become Kegan
     Paul by means of his international banking interests and work as India
      agent. For King, publishing primarily offered new opportunities for financial
      diversification and innovative entrepreneurship. Nevertheless, the publishing
     world remained dominated by aversion to risk and liable, in John
     Sutherland’s memorable phrase, to ‘toe-dipping caution’.*° Credit and insur-
      ance availability did lower book trades transaction costs, but development
     was uneven. Banking operations continued to be based primarily on the
      relative respectability and credit reputation of the operators. As Charles
     Kegan Paul was to remind readers of his memoirs at the end of the nineteenth
      century, ready access to capital remained indispensable to the successful
     publishing business.**
       In 1891, Samuel Smiles offered a mixed account of the changes in his
     biography of one of the greatest nineteenth-century publishers, John
     Murray II, who had died in 1843. Smiles wrote that ‘the old association of

                                    facility
 communication ... Speculation [for retail booksellers to buy on special
 terms] has now almost ceased in consequence of the enormous number of
 books published.’ Smiles concluded that ‘the country booksellers’ were dying
 out because ‘profits on books being cut down to a minimum, these tradesmen
 find it almost impossible to live by the sale of books alone. Cheap bookselling,
 the characteristic of the age, has been promoted by the removal of the tax on
 paper’. His next point echoed Carlyle: ‘This cheapness has been accompanied
 by a distinct deterioration in the taste and industry of the general reader. The
 multiplication of Reviews, Magazines, manuals, and abstracts, has impaired
 the love of, and perhaps the capacity for study, research, and scholarship on
 which the general quality of literature must depend.’'*
               Cheaper books
 Obituaries of the sensational London bookseller James Lackington in 1815
 recalled the foundation of modern cheap book retailing and the success of his
 book emporium for which, in the words of his trade motto, ‘small profits do
 great things’. Beginning in the 1820s, the transformation in printing capacity
 ensured the advance of further developments in publishing and bookselling.
 The production of very cheap books in large quantities and in slighter formats
 replaced the earlier, economically necessary publication of editions in small
 numbers, often in cumbersome multivolumes, at relatively high prices.
  Ultimately, it was the reduction in printing, typesetting and paper costs that
 enabled new economies of scale and the satisfaction by publishers of new
 levels of demand. The early-nineteenth-century publishing industry was pro-
 pelled by cheap popular literature and notably by reprint series and the new
 ‘book series’ such as John Murray’s Family Library, first issued in 1829, and
 Gervais Charpentier’s Bibliotheque Charpentier, launched in Paris in 1838.
 Lower prices were exemplified by Michel Lévy’s one-franc literary series, but
 increasingly cheap print (once the preserve of chapbooks and ballads)
 extended to a great range of manuals, guide books, dictionaries and religious
 books. British railway books and ‘yellowbacks’ of the 1840s and 1850s
 retailed at between 1s and 2s 6d, with cheaper paper-covered novels, travel
 books and the like selling at rs or below. George Routledge’s Railway Library
 of more than 1,000 titles began in 1848, the year of W. H. Smith’s first
 station bookstall. Louis Hachette’s Bibliothéque des chemins de fer com-
 menced in 1853.
  The risks of high capital expenditure and storage had long made it unwise

     books, hymn books and cheap morality periodicals. During the nineteenth
     century, the greatly expanding number of titles and hugely increased volume
     of print (as well as its increasing secularization and specialization) clearly
      resulted in more extensive distribution and a wider readership. Production
      runs for the most successful titles were now immense. In an industry of
     unprecedented publishing capacity, Chapman and Hall in London published
     and sold more than half a million volumes of Dickens in the last three years
      of the author’s life.'? Routledge’s British Poets, begun in the 1850s, included
      several editions of well over 110,000 copies. Yet these, again, paled before
      the cheap editions of the poets and the colossal paperback series of 6d
      novels, commonly manufactured by newspaper machines in runs of 25,000
     and more. Hachette’s Journal pour tous, Cassell’s ‘National Library’ and
     ‘Masterpiece Library’, and many others, were to effect a mechanization of
      literature beyond even the anticipation of Carlyle.**
      By the mid-nineteenth century, therefore, the extension of cheap print
     supported the development of a new working-class market, quite distinct
     from the older chapbook and ballad readership of the previous two centuries.
      In the Low Countries, the hugely popular Nederlandsche Muzenalmanak was
      offered in five differently priced versions between 1819 and 1847. Many
     publishers extended their ethical and commercial mission to bring knowledge
      to the working classes, with a further and immense development of the
     European colonial and overseas market. Domestic publishers were infuriated
     by the contrast between success at home and the increased piracy abroad of
      successful literary titles. Linguistic divisions played a part: in Belgium, French
     publishing benefited from the wider francophone industry while Flemish
     publications were modest at the beginning of the nineteenth century.
     Norwegian publishing continued to be dominated by Danish interests and,
     among many examples, publishing in Polish, Slovak, Balkan and Baltic
     languages championed minority revivalist movements.
      Newspaper publication requires special mention. By 1850, ten times more
     newspapers were published than in 1750, and nearly three times more than in
     1830. In many parts of the world, mechanized printing of newspapers trans-
     formed print supply. Spanish-American presses, for example, produced rela-
      tively few books but a huge and escalating volume of periodical and
     newspaper publication through the nineteenth century. In regions where
      printing had long been established, the newspaper revolution was just as
     marked. In 1821, 267 different newspapers and periodicals were published
      in England and Wales; by 1851, this total reached 563.*5 The increase in the
      size of newspaper editions was even more remarkable, a transformation
     boosted in the 1850s by experiments in the manufacture of paper using

 By 1843, these sales amounted to between 20,000 and 55,000 each, and by
 1854, some 110,000.*° The British government finally removed stamp duty
 on newspapers in 185 5, although the one remaining ‘tax on knowledge’, that
 levied on paper (reduced from 3d to 14d in every pound weight in 1836), was
 not abolished until 1861.*7 In Britain, some 125,000 separate newspaper and
 periodical titles were published during the nineteenth century.® By 1907,
 newspaper production was to account for 28 per cent of the total net value of
 all British publications. *?
  The new reprinting regime was marked by the changing size of average
 print runs, based on the reduced unit cost of the book. The critical develop-
 ment occurred in the 1840s. The size of the average print run in Britain
 doubled between 1836 and 1916, but with an average print run of 500 copies
 in the 1830s, this increased by half again to 750 in the 1840s (increasing by a
 further third to 1,000 between 1860 and 1920).”° Large print runs and low
 prices, personified by the profile of American firms like Ticknor and Fields (of
 Boston, founded 1854), contributed to a business model in advance of most
 European publishers. Structured, mass and centralized popular publishing
 responded to growing consumer demand, advanced by the continued expan-
 sion of part-issues, periodicals and newspapers, circulating libraries, public
 libraries and, especially in the late nineteenth century, by new demand for
 educational literature and school books. Publishing (however much directed
 by strong-minded entrepreneurs) remained in thrall to capital requirements,
 legal frameworks, technological constraints and the efficiency of distribution
 networks. Increased divisions between publishers and booksellers trans-
 formed onward-selling, discount and remaindering systems. The mechanized
 production of cheap books opened up markets, even though contradictory
 principles were also at issue. Campaigns on behalf of authors’ rights proved
 inimical to the campaign for cheap books. Older cooperative methods
 changed, especially in the US, as publishers superseded booksellers, selling
 books wholesale to merchants and other outlets. Despite the longer print runs
 enabled by mechanization and efficiencies of scale, profit margins tightened in
 an increasingly competitive market. Publishers needed to sell a greater pro-
 portion of an edition to cover costs, accentuating the need for more accurate
 forecasting of demand and the printing of low-risk quantities.
  In the final decades of the nineteenth century, the surging demand for
 educational books across the globe was never homogeneous but it did
 broaden, as prestige titles led to a multitude of cheap, small format books
 for elementary schools. Greater stratification of the market resulted from

     ‘churn’, requiring fresh titles to maintain its strength. By contrast, the increas-
     ing specialization of knowledge supported the extension and division of
     periodical publications. As publishers sold more books but received less per
     volume, market-building was sustained by a transformation in distribution
     systems and greater competitiveness in foreign markets.
      Domestic supporting agencies notably included commercial libraries,
     while demand was further boosted by subscription book-clubs, private and
     town debating and literary societies, advancing working-men’s clubs
     (founded either by or for labouring men) and the solemn recommendations
     of the periodical reviews and magazines. In most European and American
     countries, serialization advanced still further as a dependable form of low-
     ering publication risks and attracting new custom; various hybrid and
     mutant forms of the periodical and serial sustained, in particular, the market
     for fiction. It has generally been claimed that the publication of the infamous
     three-decker novel supported the circulating libraries; more certainly, rail-
     way stalls were supplied by cheap fiction in single volumes, part-issues and
     so-called ‘library series’.
      The London bookseller G. R. Porter confidently welcomed the cheapening
     of literature: ‘books can no longer be considered, as they were in bygone
     times, a luxury, to be provided for the opulent, who alone as a class, could
     read and enjoy them. From year to year the circle is widening in which
      literature becomes almost a necessity of life’.** Nevertheless, the material
      cost of many books also limited the social extension of book buying, borrow-
     ing and reading. A new Balzac novel in the 1830s cost more than the weekly
     income of most French working-class families. New, not reprinted, ‘literature’
     remained the most expensive category of publication throughout the century.
      In times of financial restraint the market withered. As John Murray III wrote
      to Gladstone in 1851, ‘it must be borne in mind that books are a luxury; when
      a time of distress comes, the first expense to be curtailed is the purchase of
     books. That is done (without any outward display of economy) rather than
     laying down a carriage or dismissing servants.’** Despite all the cheap weekly
     part-issues, the popular reprint series and the increased production of small
     publications, booksellers maintained the relatively high price of many types
     of book. Only the second-hand trade and the market stall sustained working-
      class readers at times when new editions proved beyond their purse. Many of
     the writers experienced by working-class readers were dead and unfashion-
      able. It is also the case that inequalities in terms of access to print increased
     across Europe. The publication of almanacs, ABCs and religious primers
     hugely increased in Italy in the nineteenth century, for example, yet 75 per
     cent of the population as a whole remained illiterate in 1870 (90 per cent in

            Printing and publishing houses
 In Europe and in the Americas, distinctions among publishers, printers and
 booksellers also took on modern appearances by the mid-nineteenth century,
 even though the combination and acquisition of the separate businesses
 occurred reguiarly. In Britain, the printing firm Bradbury and Evans
 expanded and advanced as publishers; Smith Elder began as a trading com-
 pany, then added publishing and finally took on a printery.”? In the same
 way, many press products acquired greater distinctiveness in terms of their
 type or firm of origin, yet some publishers were able to develop many types,
 each contributing to the definition of the brand.
  The transformation of the British trade and of the range of printed litera-
 ture in the first half of the nineteenth century was led by the so-called ‘list’
 publishers including Blackwood, Longman, Murray and Bentley, where
 10,000 or more copies of an edition were published. Throughout western
 Europe the maintenance, and in many cases the advance, of books as luxury
 items in the eighteenth century underscores the significance of the steep rise in
 publication tallies from the 1820s and the lowering of publication costs. At
 the same time, publishers widened their market by offering variously priced
 editions, appealing to a range of incomes, and serving increased demand for
 educational texts, travel books and science literature.
  Publication costs lowered in accordance with available capital, labour and
 new technological capabilities, but the pricing of many books reflected a fresh
 evaluation of the market in which price cutting and onward-sales discounting
 introduced new perils for the wholesale publisher. Retailing and allied ser-
 vices (as well as the amount and length of credit offered) expanded to match
 the changing commercial potential of the audience. The customized pack-
 aging of books, part-issues and magazines, so competitively practised in the
 late eighteenth century, advanced to new levels in the mass market of the mid-
 nineteenth century. Coloured wrappers, extravagant advertising and new
 technical accomplishment in illustration, indexes and title pages all served
 to lure new custom. Clashes were inevitable. Publishers of some new books
 had for decades inflated rather than discounted prices. Subscription collection
 and, increasingly, more adept market profiling had also continued to nurture
 specialist publication. Most readers now benefited from a discount on the
 cover price of a book, but the division between wholesale publishers and retail
 booksellers widened further. Nevertheless, the ever-larger editions of cheap
 books risked on the market forced tighter and tighter profit margins on the
 booksellers. The solution was not to come until 1890 and the net book

     In the 1840s and 1850s, however, in a period of unrestricted competition,
     many booksellers were forced increasingly to work in concert to combat
     variable trade and retail pricing.
      By the mid-nineteenth century, unprecedented industrial plant sustained
     and enhanced productive capacity. In 1853 Harper and Brothers in New
     York erected a celebrated seven-storey factory to replace a burned-out and
     much more modest establishment. In 1866, Clowes printing factory employed
     568 men working at more than fifty presses in London. Spottiswoode and Co.,
      also of London, boasted 450 men, and the government printing office of Eyre
     and Spottiswoode, 388.** Thereafter, employment mushroomed. The Paris
     firm of Paul Dupont and the Brockhaus family in Leipzig each employed more
     than a thousand workers by the final decade of the nineteenth century.
      A freer, more competitive, and expanding market, together with more
      efficient technologies and distributive systems, provided enterprising publish-
      ers with unprecedented opportunities. In France, about 6,000 titles were
     printed in 1828, 10,000 in 1855, about 20,000 in 1880 and over 28,000 in
     1900. German publishing (more than just in German states proper) expanded
     from about 3,900 titles in 1800 to 14,000 in 1843 and over 30,000 by 1900.
      In the Netherlands, annual book production increased from a few hundred
      titles in 1800 to some 3,000 by 1900. In some countries the rise was sharpest
      at the end of the nineteenth century: Spain produced about 500 titles each
     year in the 1870s but this had risen to 2,000 by 1905; the increase in Italy was
     from about 2,000 titles in 1820 to 8,000 in 1890. In Britain, according to the
     crude title counts offered by Peddie’s English Catalogue of Books during the
     nineteenth century, 25,000 book titles were published between 1800 and
     1835 and 64,000 between 1835 and 1862. Many traditional producers
     continued, adapted and expanded. The English Stock of the Stationers’
     Company, providing dividends to its members from the publication of alma-
     nacs, still served as the mainstay of cheap publishing even by the early
     Victorian years. The use of cheaper raw materials and new industrial pro-
     cesses (notably in papermaking) lowered unit costs and hugely improved the
     return on invested capital. Between 1846 and 1916, the volume of publication
     was to quadruple while the average price of literature halved.*5 The machine
     age had indeed arrived. In 1841 some 50,000 men and women were employed
      in the paper, printing, book and stationery trades in Britain; by 1871 the total
     was some 125,000.”°
      Advances in printing technology also reshaped textual appearance and
     authors achieved new control over spelling, punctuation and other acciden-
      tals. With the increased speed of production, publishers, in contrast to their
     predecessors, used printing and composing developments and the easier

                                     gra-
 dually challenged outright sale of copyright as the most popular form of
 publishing contract. The new commission contracts specified the fees charged
 for organizing the printing, binding and distribution of the books, as well as
 securing a percentage of all sales. Less popular contract types included simple
 royalties, royalties reserved until the sale of a specified number of books
 (a system open to accounting abuse), fixed-term shared profits (after the
 publisher undertook all production costs) and series contracts, used for sets
 by several authors.
  Nineteenth-century publishing houses throughout Europe continued to
 work largely in the image of their businessmen publishers and their prefer-
 ences. Powerful reputations also supported the extension of publishing and
 business ventures. The humblest operators struggled to cope with credit and
 risk management, while the superior resources of the grandest publishers
 allowed them to invest more diversely in property, annuities and a broader
 range of commercial and banking activities including investments overseas
 and the colonial trades. Large printing firms such as those of Paul Dupont in
 Paris and the family Brockhaus in Leipzig epitomized the changes in the
 nineteenth century where such book trade leviathans resembled contem-
 porary captains of industry rather than workshop master-printers. In
 France and its colonies, Hachette enthusiastically founded mutual friendly
 societies and benevolent institutions for workers, while writing pamphlets
 about assistance for the poor. At the same time, he proved an active
 campaigner in the settlement of international literary copyright questions.
 William Darton, the most important British publisher of juvenile literature
 of the first half of the nineteenth century, built upon the specialist marketing
 to parents and children pioneered by the Newberys.** George Smith, whose
 entrepreneurship secured Thackeray’s success after Vanity Fair, combined
 munificence with hardnosed management.*?
  Building on export initiatives of the eighteenth century, publishers took full
 advantage of empire and overseas. Between 1828 and 1898 the decadal value
 of publications exported to the British colonies and the US increased nearly
 thirty-fold, from about £35,800 to about £1,089,000 (or more than
 £1,336,500 including further foreign trade).*° London publishers and
 London newspapers dominated an imperial communications network. The
 firm founded in 1843 by the Scots Daniel Macmillan and his brother,
 Alexander typified the increasing reliance of publishers on overseas trade in
 the second half of the century.2‘ Hachette led numerous firms in France
 serving a diaspora from the French Caribbean and West Africa to Indochina.

      Mifflin and Harpers and Co. in the US, Gyldendals in Denmark, Norstedts
     and Albert Bonnier in Sweden and Macmillan in Britain. Supply across the
      Atlantic was not straightforward. Until the end of the nineteenth century, for
     example, France remained the greatest supplier to the Spanish American
     world of translated classics into Spanish. A campaign led by the British and
     Foreign Bible Society improved the overseas dispatch of cheap bibles.
      Millions of copies of religious texts were exported by the Religious Tract
      Society, the Bible Society and the London Missionary Society with similar
      organizations elsewhere in Europe. The first British Act concerning interna-
      tional copyright passed in 1838. Foreign authors were protected by the same
     copyright in Britain as British-born authors, provided that their country of
      birth offered reciprocal arrangements. The 1838 Act brought certain success,
      with agreements between Britain, France and Prussia in advance of the more
     formalized International Copyright Act of 1844. Booksellers and authors
      suffered even more by cheap reprints entering the colonies (American reprints
      in Canada were a particular difficulty). This was addressed by the 1842
     Copyright Act, but its clause protecting the imperial trade by forbidding
      colonial reprinting of books copyrighted in Britain could not be effectively
      policed. Restrictions against the import of foreign books into overseas British
     dominions similarly often remained unenforceable.**
      The importation of cheap books into different countries often encountered
      resistance. The successful reprinting and then importation of English books by
      foreign publishers such as Galignani in the first half of the nineteenth century
     enraged the London trade.** As a result, a series of customs acts attempted to
      tighten control, with the 1842 Customs Act requiring proprietors of copyright
      to supply customs officers with the particulars of publications thought to be
      infringed by imported piracies. The Leipzig publisher, Christian Bernhard
     Tauchnitz, visited Britain in 1843, enthused by Continental market possibilities
      for books by English authors. Tauchnitz offered to pay authors for his right to
      reprint publications abroad (while making it clear that he did not actually need
      to ask authors for their permission to do so). The agreement effectively
     excluded British publishers from the European market, while the protection
      of home interests depended upon customs officers remaining vigilant and well-
     informed. Tauchnitz did offer authors and publishers assistance in confronting
      the much more difficult American market, and a British-American governmen-
      tal agreement was signed in 1853. Nevertheless, the new agreement remained
      unratified by the US Senate and unauthorized reprinting of British books
     continued in America until an 1891 Act of Congress (and even that offered
     only limited protection).
      The expanding market in the West was paralleled by the transformation of

 private and institutional clients. In China, more than three-quarters of all
 publications (by title at least) might be termed commercial even by the 1630s.
 As court and local government sponsorship of printing proportionately fell
 away during the Ming dynasty in particular, and was replaced by non-
 commercial family publishing, the further and continuing shift towards
 commercial publishing placed new reliance upon the commercial distribution
 of texts. Differences in what was meant by ‘commercial’ and ‘private’ are
 critical to comparative global histories of the book, while recognition of the
 continuing importance of non-commercial publishing in China, India, South
 and East Asia and parts of Africa offers reassessment of the circulation of
 private and non-commercial texts in Europe, the Americas and Australasia.
 The production of printed books and pamphlets paid for by authors or
 institutions and designed for private or closed institutional circulation can
 be obscured by attention to the remarkable surge in commercial publication
 where more writers advanced manuscripts for publication and entrepreneur-
 ial publishers identified new and reduced-risk opportunities. In China and
Japan commercial printing developed more according to the genre of writing
 than to broad market demand, but sales networks had advanced since the
 seventeenth century.
  The industrial revolution of the book brought cheaper print to new
 readers, as well as fresh criticism of literary production. We might question
 the extent to which increased book production in the century before steam-
 driven presses and papermaking machines, lithography and photography
 significantly increased the number of book readers, given that demand from
 institutions (and from those already acquiring books) was more obvious
than that from working men and women. By contrast, the extension of
cheap print and newspaper circulation, especially from the 1840s, repre-
 sents the most pointed evidence for expanded literacy and for a broader
audience for print, even though literacy remained very low even in parts of
the world where printing had been established for some centuries. These
changes also brought alterations to the physical appearance of books, print
and newspapers, enabled by advances in font design, engraving and other
typographical techniques. Newly efficient distribution systems, the circum-
vention of restrictive practices and the employment of labour in the publish-
ing industry on an entirely new scale underpinned the transformation in the
production, dissemination and impact of print.*4 A technologically led

    The book in the long twentieth century
      The history of publishing in the twentieth century can be seen as a palimpsest,
      where the traces of earlier patterns have been effaced by change, but never-
      theless can be discerned through the intervening layers of business and
      cultural practice. The earliest trace inscribed on it is of the localized growth
      of printing and publishing from the fifteenth to the nineteenth century. The
     development of a multifunctional industry — choosing titles, making books,
      selling books — was constrained by rudimentary communication systems,
      confined largely to waterways and sea roads, and resulted in a large number
      of independent, family-based enterprises. The advance in more efficient com-
      munication systems in the nineteenth century, particularly of railway net-
      works and shipping companies, sustained national concentrations of
      publishers in the largest commercial or most politically important cities
      where sources of capital — financial, cultural, educational and social — were
      more plentiful. The companies remained by and large family-owned but,
      because of the increased investment needed in rapidly changing technologies
      and in stock-holding, they became more specialized, focusing as publishers on
      the selection, organization and promotion of titles.
       This second level of the palimpsest was overwritten in the twentieth century
      by a breaking out of national boundaries and the creation of transnational
      publishing corporations that provide the major theme of this chapter.
     However, in looking at the publishing industry from the perspective of the
      early twenty-first century, all three levels of the palimpsest are still evident:
      relatively small to medium independent companies, often structured as sole
      traders or partnerships, serving local or regional needs; medium to large
      publishers at national level, sometimes imprints that have survived since the
      nineteenth century, whose success often brings with it the risk of takeover by
      the uppermost level of enterprise operating transnationally; and that final
      level of conglomerate, evidence of both the concentration of ownership that
      accelerated in the late twentieth century and the self-definition of publishing

 gical narrative nor a newsreel-like country-by-country synopsis will provide a
 sufficient explanation of the historical movement towards that uppermost
 contemporary level. A nomothetic, rather than an idiographic approach is
 needed. Book historians have tried to understand the meaning of events by
 analysing unique events and experiences, and have avoided the nomothetic
 challenge to develop a generalized understanding of patterns and principles
 based on the analysis of large bodies of evidence. Indeed, the failure of book
 history to date has been to provide a synoptic and nomothetic account of the
 transition towards the contemporary in moving on from the well-tilled fields
 of nineteenth- and early twentieth-century publishing. Three reasons for this
 failure are suggested here: first, the predominance of the Anglo-American and
 the literary sectors of publishing in current scholarship and a reciprocal
 lacuna in understanding the development of non-English language publish-
 ing;* second, the lack of examination of the growth of global trading systems
 and regulators which performed an enabling function in the movement from
 national to transnational;* and third, a reluctance on the part of many book
 historians to move beyond the idiographic to seek pattern and principle, a
 reluctance that has perpetuated a mapping, rather than a broader analytical,
 mission within book history.
  The structure of the global book publishing industry has now polarized,
 comprising a small number of global publishing/media conglomerates and a
 large number of small specialist niche publishers. At the time of writing, there
 are ten major conglomerates that, in addition to being vertically integrated,
 also operate globally across media platforms to facilitate the exploitation of
common intellectual property rights. These dominant companies, in terms of
 revenues derived from publishing, are: Pearson; Reed Elsevier; Thomson
 Reuters; Wolters Kluwer; Bertelsmann; Hachette Livre; McGraw-Hill
 Education; Grupo Planeta; Cengage Learning; and Scholastic. (Bertelsmann
 has taken over Penguin from Pearson and is currently merging it with
Random House, already the largest trade publisher in the world.) What is
 striking perhaps about this list is the geographical concentration of ownership
 in Europe and the diversity of output represented, with educational, profes-
 sional and academic publishing as the preeminent sectors. Yet neither of these
 features — the geographical and the taxonomic — has particularly attracted the
attention of book historians. At the other end of the spectrum, national
industries include a larger number of smaller, independent publishing com-
panies, where the domestic market represents their primary focus and the
source of their titles and revenue. They serve that local market in terms of

      distinctive characteristics. Histories of the book organized within the borders
      of the nation state give them undue prominence: partly through a misleading
      sense of historical survival and continuity from the nineteenth to the twenty-
       first century; and partly because of their undoubted contribution to the nation
      state’s sense of itself.
       The description of the third, the contemporary, level of the palimpsest
      contains two implicit views of publishing: as a function in which value is
      added to textual (and graphic) content in the transmission from author to
      reader; and as a transnational industry with distinct but changing structures
      operating, by and large, within a liberal capitalist economy in pursuit of
      profit — if only to sustain itself. The former perspective defines the publisher
       as managing a process across all platforms in which there is a progressive
      accretion of value; while the latter acknowledges, despite perceptions to the
      contrary, including self-perceptions, that the publisher is market-focused but
      not necessarily market-led. Transnational operations increase market access
      through the transmission of content through other publishing businesses, all
      under common ownership (and possibly sister companies in TV, film and
      other media). The importance of transnational operations lies less in the
      achievement of economies of scale and other synergies, though these can be
      significant, than in dominance, to the point of control, of national markets.
      That dominance, as the case of Harlequin discussed below shows, need not
      imply the distribution of ‘transnational content’, that is, material derived
      from Anglo-American culture and sold through, unmediated, into national
      markets as is the practice of the film and TV industries. Rather than agents of
      homogeneity, translations from English seem to be a form of recognition of
      and acquiescence in cultural difference. The continuing power in the label
      of ‘cultural industry’ that is applied to publishing should not be underesti-
      mated. It implies acting in support of a national, or on occasion linguistic,
      culture in a manner distinct from the other mass media. Indeed, the move in
      the course of the twentieth century away from the hardback to the paperback
       as the major format for print publishing has typically been viewed as a key
     component in the democratization of knowledge; it reflects that trend, of
      course, but it also arises from the need to expand markets by lowering price
      through longer print runs in an attempt to create a virtuous circle of supply
      and demand.
       At the beginning of the twentieth century, the Germans were using the label
      Kulturverlag to designate a publishing business of the kind that underpinned
      the new (since 1870) country’s growing sense of nationalism and of pride
       in its scientific, industrial and cultural advances. A number of these
      Kulturverlage from the end of the nineteenth century onwards promoted a

                        before the First World War,
 national publishing in Germany, rather than in the UK or US, represented the
 then peaks of achievement both in book production and in innovative mar-
 keting.* Yet this predominance, while evident to contemporaries who flocked
 to the Leipzig and Frankfurt Book Fairs each year, fails to register in most
 current Anglophone studies of twentieth-century publishing which focus on
 the UK and US as if that was all that mattered.
  German publishing and printing companies had made large investments in
 printing technology and maintained, even for popular markets, high stan-
 dards of quality in production. German institutions were graduating highly
 skilled graphic designers who were encouraged in their innovation and crea-
 tivity. Even in the period after the Second World War, German-trained
 designers, such as Giovanni Mardersteig, Jan Tschichold and Hans
 Schmoller, continued to exercise a strong influence on the quality and appear-
 ance of the printed book throughout Europe. Covers and format were often
 seen as crucial in the branding necessary for marketing and promotion.
 Germany had book-distribution machines at railway stations, mainline and
 branch, from before the First World War and, in the period after it, pioneered
 the marketing integration of books and films. The paperback first appeared in
 Germany as a publication in its own right, seeking out fresh markets, and not
 just as the hardback without a board cover. The Kulturverlage produced, as
 paperbacks, good books at low prices. In doing this, they were addressing the
 democratization of German society by coopting working-class intellectuals
 into mainstream German culture. They also provided a visual contrast to the
 garish covers of the trash literature that was thought to be a major corrupting
 factor in the decline of traditional German values.
  Although the defining characteristics of the paperback can be traced back to
 the nineteenth century and before (the binding and cover material, the con-
 venient size and the long print run), in Germany at the beginning of the
 twentieth century the format gained in importance as the major vehicle for
 print publishing. The development of the format had always been closely linked
 to function. If books were to be rebound by their owners to create a more
 permanent and uniform library, then the publishers need only issue them in
 inexpensive covers. If books were regarded by their owners as relatively dis-
 posable upon reading, after whiling away the time on a railway journey or on
 holiday, for example, then the publishers need only issue them in inexpensive
 covers. If books were to be carried around a great deal, on a train or to the salon
 of a spa hotel, then publishers needed to produce them in conveniently portable
 sizes and weights. However, in the first half of the twentieth century, publishers

     democratization of knowledge through provision of good books at low prices.
     They found that they could reduce costs by reprinting, in long runs and in
     uniform formats, titles that had already proven themselves in either the cockpit
      of the marketplace or that of criticism. The pre-existing reputation (of title or
      author) would be the selling-point, rather than the visual appeal of the cover.
     Mass-market consumption did not demand self-advertisement of the individual
      title, but it did require recognition of, and confidence in, the publisher as brand.
     Advertising the brand rather than the individual titles promoted confidence
     among both bourgeois and working-class readers alike. The “Universal-
      Bibliothek’ of Reclam, for example, comprised (and comprises) a large series
      of reprints of well-known authors at low prices that began with a liberalization
      of German copyright law in 1867. The standardization of the Universal-
      Bibliothek lent itself in 1912 to the introduction of its own book-vending slot
     machines of which there were 2,000 by 1917, as Reclam exploited both a
     hunger for self-education and a renewed cultural nationalism.°
       Yet this German precedent, while again evident to contemporaries, receives
       little recognition within a book history that remains stubbornly focused on
     London and New York. In particular, the advances achieved by German
     publishing houses such as Reclam, from branding through standardization
      of size to creating a popular market, are credited to Anglo-American publish-
      ers such as Allen Lane. The latter’s establishment of Penguin Books in 193 5
      can rightly be perceived as a transformative moment in the history of British
      publishing but not in a wider global context. Lane did bring a dynamism and
      energy to the adoption of the German precedent. He had learnt the lesson that
      to sell the Penguin brand entailed convincing the public of the rightness and
      reliability of its badged titles. The initial ten Penguins were a judicious mix of
      detective fiction, of the ‘naughty but nice’ autobiography of Beverly Nichols,
      of the light, deft humour of Eric Linklater and of the accessible seriousness
      of Ariel, the biography of Shelley by André Maurois. This blend brought
     commercial success even in the first year of operation: three million books
     were sold, using 600 tons of paper, and creating a turnover of £75,000;
      the bestsellers were Dorothy L. Sayers, The Unpleasantness at the Bellona
      Club; Margot Asquith, Autobiography; Beverly Nichol, Twenty-Five; Liam
      O'Flaherty, The Informer; and Mary Webb, Gone to Earth, and from his
      share of the profits Allen Lane bought a nine-ton cutter, christened ‘Penguin’.7
      The first major US paperback house, Pocket Books, was founded in 1939
      based on the German-originated Penguin model (eschewing the class of
      birds and choosing a kangaroo as its logo) after several ventures, including
      that of the Boni brothers, had failed in the preceding two decades. Its first ten
      titles were as conservative as those of Penguin four years earlier: a judicious

      the classic, Shakespeare and Emily Bronté, the contemporary,
 Dorothy Parker and Thornton Wilder and the title that defies categorization,
 Felix Salten’s Bambi. Nevertheless, in order to compete for readers, each title
 had its own distinctive cover, ranging from the semi-surrealist to the semi-
 photographic. Avon Books, its major competitor, was founded in 1941 and
 was almost immediately sued by Pocket Books for plagiarism of the
 format. Pocket Books lost — little wonder given its own debt to Penguin and
 the latter’s to German precedent set by publishers such as Reclam and
 Albatross in the development of the paperback.*® Avon’s covers were even
 more striking than those of its rival; they ranged from the semi-photographic
 to the semi-pornographic. Title competed with title, lacking the emphasis on
 both brand and decorum characteristic of their German (and British)
 predecessors.”
  Some German paperback publishers, such as Tauchnitz, had realized,
 however, even in the mid-nineteenth century, that the market for German
 books was limited by the size of the German-language-speaking community
 itself. So they sought to extend that market by also publishing in English, both
 for English-as-a-second-language speakers and for the primary English mar-
 kets around the world including the US. In this, they anticipated the late
 twentieth-century move by Bertelsmann (Germany), Hachette (France) and
 Planeta (Spain) into English-language publishing. They also anticipated the
 growth of an international marketplace regulated by copyright legislation.
 Tauchnitz itself had established by the mid-nineteenth century a confident
 reputation for its reprints of British and American authors in an English-
 language paperback series not for sale in the UK for copyright reasons.
 From 1841 to 1937 it issued some 5,000 titles, selling some 60 million
 copies in total. All the great figures of English literature, particularly the
 Victorian novelists, were to be found in its easily recognizable format. The
 strengthening of intellectual property conventions, including significantly
 the International Copyright Act (Berne Convention) of 1886, to regulate
 increasingly globalized commerce and communication in a manner that
 would protect, in the case of copyright, the interests of its creators, owners
 and licensees, only served to provide Tauchnitz with something of a mono-
 poly as far as its copyright titles of these prominent and popular authors were
 concerned. The company ‘conquered’ the US, dominating retail and library
 sales of English popular fiction there for the second half of the nineteenth
 century. (Tauchnitz did produce American authors such as Washington
 Irving, Hawthorne and Longfellow but in editions for sale outside the US.)
 Tauchnitz also exploited the European railway network both to distribute

      Balestier were seen off; but the US market was effectively closed to Tauchnitz
     imports on the introduction of the Chace Act in 1891 as part of a programme
      of increasing American protectionism. *°
      German publishing before 1918 was, in sum, less of a profession for
     gentlemen and more of a business demanding the highest standards of pro-
      fessionalism. It produced books for its own internal markets, driven by a
      sense of cultural mission as well as profit, and it sought to enter other,
      particularly English-language, markets in an embryonic attempt to obviate
      the lack of a large population (as the US had) or a large Empire (as the UK
      had). Its decline after 1918 was due to the economic hardships of the postwar
      period and, after 1933, to the effects of Nazi policy upon the book trade
     and its readers and upon Jewish members of both groups. Yet both the US and
      the UK were to benefit as these high standards of German practice, and its
      qualities of innovation and creativity, were to be transmitted in the 1930s and
     beyond to both countries by Jewish immigrants such as Kurt Enoch, Kurt
      Wolff, George Weidenfeld and Paul Hamlyn. As Germany entered into
      almost two decades of self-destruction through two world wars and a sub-
      sequent territorial and ideological division, the contribution of its émigrés
      ensured the transfer of such excellence to Anglo-American publishing. **
       Excellence survived in Germany itself to reemerge in the second half of the
      century. Bertelsmann, founded in 1835, weathered these storms and stresses
      of twentieth-century German history to undertake an expansion in the 1950s
     through another form of the democratization of knowledge, the book club. It
      successfully used its model of operating book clubs to enter national markets
      in France, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain.** By the 1970s the company had
      also moved, through strategic acquisitions, into magazine and music publish-
      ing and later into broadcasting. Bertelsmann, through its ownership of
     Random House and now Penguin (some irony surely), has become the largest
      trade (consumer) publisher in the world. Springer Verlag, founded in 1842,
     undertook an international expansion from the 1960s onwards, including
      the setting up of branches in Japan, India and Hong Kong. A flirtation
      with Bertelsmann ended in 2003 but a series of further mergers and acquisi-
      tions created Springer Science and Business Media, one of the world’s
      largest publishers of scientific, technical and medical (STM) journals and
      books, as well as online services. Holtzbrinck, although younger than either
     Bertelsmann or Springer (it was founded in 1948), adopted the former’s
     model of the book club to fuel its rapid growth in the 1960s through acquisi-
      tions of other publishers in Germany. By the 1980s, the company felt secure
     enough to begin a series of takeovers of publishing houses in the US and the
     UK, including established names such as Farrar, Straus and Giroux, Holt and

                               the world’s most
 important publishers (in English) can be ascribed both to the reassertion of
 Germany’s leading position in publishing and to the vulnerability of US and
 UK publishing houses when exposed to a newly dominant free-market ideol-
 ogy after a long period of protectionism. This in turn brought about a
 paradoxical situation by the end of the twentieth century of the dominance
 of Anglo-American published content but the increase in non-US or UK
 ownership of these globalized publishers through companies such as
 Bertelsmann, Springer and Holtzbrinck.
  The competition to German publishing in the US and the UK before 1914
 and until the 1970s had been largely complacent. The US possessed a large
 and growing internal market that it tried to protect assiduously, for example,
 through the earlier noted 1891 Chace Act, misleadingly termed the
 International Copyright Act. The latter contained a clause requiring that
 foreign works be manufactured in the US to achieve copyright protection
 there. The Chace Act was superseded by the Copyright Code of 1909 but the
 manufacturing clause survived. It remained in place until 1978 when
 American manufacturing began to move overseas, as it had done in the UK
 and Europe from the 1960s, in a move to reduce production costs and, in
 some cases such as Singapore, to take advantage of investment there in new
 printing technologies. This protectionism by the US at the beginning of the
 twentieth century could be justified by its continuing need to nation-build
 after its Civil War and the continuing settlement of new territories coupled
 with continuing immigration from Europe. Publishers, of newspapers as well
 as of books, provided a common currency for the nation. Yet the US did not
 join the Berne Convention of 1886 until 1989. The imperative to protect its
 home market, long after the need to nation-build, outweighed any sense of a
 new need to participate in international trading. This imbalance may have
 weakened US-based companies’ ability to resist takeover in the last quarter of
 the twentieth century. That home market had been boosted in 1945-6 by the
 GI Bill and consequent expansion in higher education and then perpetuated
 by that other consequence of war, the baby boom. Not that war was over:
 cold succeeded hot. The perceived competition with the Soviet Bloc in science
 and technology, as well as the need to demonstrate the superiority of western
 culture, led to the National Defense Education Act of 1958 with increased
 support for universities and libraries. The United States Information Agency
 (USIA), later the United States Information Service (USIS), was created with a
 brief to fight the cultural battle, particularly in non-aligned countries, through
 the weapons of American books and American authors, to the benefit of the

     81,000 publishers responsible for 3.1 billion books — albeit that, as discussed
     above, the largest of these were now in ‘foreign’ ownership.
      After the Second World War, US publishers were driven by the same need
      to grow beyond this large home market as fuelled the transnational ventures
     of German companies. The War itself, and the subsequent Marshall Plan for
     Europe, had lifted American eyes to the prospects of international sales.
     However, just as clear was the need to reach an accommodation with fellow
     Anglophone publishers in the UK, itself worried about the transition to
     national independence within its Empire (with India the first to negotiate its
     autonomy in 1947). Particularly in the period from 1948 to 1975, both UK
     and US businesses tried to perpetuate a transatlantic protectionism through
     two measures: through strategic alliances and mergers between companies or
     the opening of branches in one another’s countries (Cambridge University
      Press set up in the US in 1949; Oxford University Press limped behind in
     1950); and through the mutually beneficial Traditional Markets Agreement
     (TMA). Until its termination in 1975 after an anti-trust suit brought in the US
      in 1974, the TMA divided the markets for English-language books into those
     that were exclusive to one or other of the UK or US editions and those that
     were ‘open’ where both editions competed against one another. UK publish-
      ers tended to exercise their monopoly in those territories (with the occasional
     exception of Canada) which had constituted part of the former Empire, now
     Commonwealth. Australia, and to a lesser extent New Zealand and South
     Africa, were key protected markets for UK publishers. No British publisher
     would buy or sell rights in a particular title unless a monopoly was ceded over
      sales in the traditional market. Contracts for the publication of specific
      titles would condense this list of markets as ‘British Commonwealth and
     Empire as constituted in 1947’. By the early 1960s they specified ‘British
     Commonwealth and Empire as constituted at the date of this agreement
     together with the Republic of South Africa, the Irish Republic, Burma,
     Egypt, Iraq, Israel, Jordan and the British Trusteeships with the rest of the
     world an open market except the US, its dependencies and the Philippine
      Islands’. From the mid-1960s some UK contracts omitted Israel; while others,
      in the face of aggressive US competition, clarified the position of Canada by
     specifying ‘UK and Commonwealth including Canada’.
      The TMA was significant because of the dependence of the UK on its
     overseas markets. Exports accounted for 40 per cent of the total British
     books manufactured in 1961; 25 per cent of these were destined for
     Australia alone. The UK domestic market remained small and publishers
     there had always relied on strong export sales, except for those obviously
     committed to a niche market. For the best part of thirty years, the TMA

              on a legal framework within most of the
 territories specified within the TMA, in terms of both a foundation of English
 legal principles and practices and a tendency, even after independence, to look
 to precedents set in the courts of London.
  The UK had therefore guarded closely the imperial markets within which
 its home-based companies could prosper, in books as much as in sugar or
 textiles. Such an international trading network demanded not only regulation
 by the imperial centre but also a process of international legal standardization
 and control reflecting (and contributing to) a globalizing commercial impera-
 tive in which national jurisdictions had to be brought into harmony one
 by one. The creation of the International Telegraph Union in 1865 was an
 early example of this process, followed among others by the Berne
 Convention of 1886 noted above. Yet this also represented the beginning of
 a gradual secession of national legal sovereignty to organizations such as the
 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trades (GATT) and the World Trade
 Organization/World Intellectual Property Organization (WTO/WIPO) in
 the pursuit of and resulting from a dominant (from the 1980s) ideological
 belief in free trade. By the 1990s, international copyright regulation enabled
 US and UK authors and publishers to trade everywhere in intangible rights,
 rather than material books, in order to optimize revenues. That general
 commitment to open markets, on the other hand, would leave national
 publishers in the UK and US open to takeover by competitors elsewhere (as
 opposed to the deterrents to foreign ownership found at this period, for
 example, in a Canada constantly threatened by the economic and cultural
 muscle of its southern neighbour). The legacy of Reaganism in the US and of
 Thatcherism in the UK would be for their publishing industries an increased
 foreign ownership. By 2003, five out of the eight largest publishing houses in
 the US were part of transnational conglomerates: Pearson (UK), Thomson
 (Canada), Reed Elsevier (UK and Netherlands), Bertelsmann (Germany) and
 Wolters Kluwer (Netherlands).
  Throughout the twentieth century, Anglo-American complacency would
 also be challenged and slowly dispelled by the growth of indigenous publish-
 ing in the British Dominions, such as Australia and Canada. Behind its own
 form of statutory protectionism, Canadian publishing sought to assert its
 independence both from the ‘mother country’ and from the US. In the case of
 Harlequin this resulted not in stagnation but in a secure base from which a
 programme of international expansion could be undertaken to the point

     the North American publication rights to the novels of Mills and Boon. The
      latter had been specializing in this genre of fiction since the 1930s and had
      built up a very efficient editorial operation, a large backlist and a stable
     market in the UK. By 1964, Harlequin had dropped its own list and was
     focusing solely on reprinting Mills and Boon titles. These it sold into the much
     larger North American market through supermarkets and other retail outlets
     where buying one of its books could become a regular part of general shop-
     ping. In 1971, Harlequin bought Mills and Boon. When it was itself taken
     over in 1981 by another Canadian company, Torstar, owner of the Toronto
     Star, this signalled the beginning of a period of further North American
     expansion. Silhouette, based in the US, was taken over in 1984, giving
     Harlequin by 1992 85 per cent of the total North American market for
     genre romance. In 1974, it had entered the German market; by 1981 it had
     branches in Scandinavia and Finland; after 1989, it opened subsidiaries in
     Hungary, Poland and the then Czechoslovakia; and in 1995 it penetrated the
     largest single market in the world, China, publishing in both Mandarin and
     English.*? At the time of writing, the incumbent Canadian government is
     dismantling many of the barriers to foreign ownership of Canadian compa-
      nies. It takes little imagination to envisage a cash-rich Chinese company
     buying Harlequin in the same reverse manoeuvre as Harlequin effected on
     Mills and Boon in 1971.
      Eva Hemmungs Wirtén argues cogently that Harlequin went beyond just
      the basic act of translation, undertaking a more sophisticated form of trans-
     national editing to acculturate Anglo-American books for overseas markets.
     The English-language originals are not only translated into Swedish, for
     example, but their cultural references and values are adjusted for the sensi-
      bilities of the Swedish reader.'* This would seem to support the concept of
      ‘glocalization’, a term coined by the sociologist Roland Robertson to denote a
     form of syncretism or hybridity in which the local borrows and adapts the
     global. While glocalization might seem to have validity only where an indi-
     genous language and culture thrive, and are not suffering linguistic competi-
     tion from English, such a form of customization supports the argument
     suggested above, that the transnational trade publishing industry may appear
      less guilty of propagating a homogeneous form of content than the film, TV
     and games industries.
      The collapse of the TMA after 1975 hastened the creation of further cross-
      Atlantic conglomerates, such as HarperCollins (1987), and the concentration
     of ownership noted above. The complacency of the British industry had been
     bolstered not only by the TMA but also by the net book agreement (NBA), a
     form of internal price-fixing. Publishers’ attitudes reflected the smug insular-

 also in the ‘special relationship’ with the US that the TMA itself characterized.
 The collapse of the latter also prefigured the UK’s hesitant, and often recalci-
 trant, membership of the then European Economic Community, now
 European Union. This has had to date little effect upon conditions for readers
 as publishing has been regarded, due in the main to French influence, as a
 cultural industry. It is therefore part of the cultural exception that allows
 individual member countries to regulate publishing at the national level
 through, for example, the level of VAT (sales tax) or statutory fixed retail
 prices. However, those EU countries that were originally part of the Soviet
 Bloc in the period roughly 1946-89 have moved away from a command
 economy (producing approved publications serving the interests of state
 and party) to the liberal capitalist model of western Europe and North
 America. Not that there were not shades of grey in this transition: Poland
 under communism demonstrated great innovation in graphic design and in
 the production particularly of children’s books while most Soviet Bloc coun-
 tries encouraged and supported cultural (but not nationalist) publishing
 within limits; and in the immediate period after 1989, many of these countries
 experienced a brutal form of capitalism with local enterprises taken over by
 western companies, for example most of Hungarian publishing by German
 firms, and others resorting to pornography to ensure their survival. Within
 the EU, the only boundaries to the sale of books are linguistic and even these
 are being eroded through the steady adoption of English as the language of
 sectors of higher education and business. Transnational trading in e-books,
 driven by the consumer need to have the latest bestseller instantly and by
 companies such as Amazon that recognize no national borders, for taxation
 as well as for trading, may eventually lead to some harmonization between
 and within all states of the EU (and there is precedent for this in the European
 Union’s Database Directive). Further integration of the regulation of publish-
 ing globally under the auspices of the WTO may be a further consequence of
 the growth of the e-book (and of English as a common language).
  Yet, if there is to be one nation’s publishing industry that would surely run
 counter to this move to the global and to the growth of Anglo-American (and
 English-language) content, then France would be prime candidate. Certainly
 for the first seventy years of the twentieth century, French publishing had
 reflected the linguistic nationalism and insularity of the nation, partly
 explained by its access to those imperial territories in north and west Africa
that it was resolutely turning francophone. Political polarization within

     French publishing began to look outwards. During the war, the degree of
     accommodation within publishing with the Nazis generally reflected the
      nation as a whole, both in the occupied zone and in Vichy. Many companies
     continued but under the control of the occupation forces or of Pétainist
      ministers and, in both cases, limited in the material resources, particularly
      paper, available to them. Clandestine publishing took place in support of the
      resistance, whether the Free French or the Communists; the Free French also
     smuggled in material produced in exile.‘ However, in the immediate after-
     math of the war, a state of literal and metaphorical exhaustion was apparent:
      stocks were almost non-existent and reprints seemed easier undertakings than
     new works. These conditions, coupled with continuing economic austerity
     and rising labour and material costs, produced by the 1960s consolidation
     within the industry in the form of two dominant groups, Hachette and Presses
      de la Cité.
       This environment of austerity was largely true of postwar Europe as a
     whole (including the UK). Paper shortages continued to limit production not
     only of trade books but also of school textbooks and other materials vital to
     reconstruction and recovery. To the west of the newly established Iron
      Curtain, purges took place of publishers and writers linked with prewar
      fascist movements or guilty of collaboration with the Nazi occupation admin-
      istrations. To the east of the Iron Curtain, within the new sphere of Soviet
      influence, purges took place of those who might hold views subversive of
      the newly imposed Communist regimes and publishing was controlled, just
      as strictly as under the Nazis, as a key tool of party policy. The resulting
      shortages of human capital throughout continental Europe slowed down
      the development of its publishing industry and its ability to reach prewar
      levels of national attainment (or in the case of Germany pre-1918 levels). In
     France the postwar recriminations and investigations did not formally close
      until 1955 and, by then, the new international divisions had hardened. In
     western Europe, publishing was viewed by many as a key instrument of anti-
     Communism, even if only as a demonstration of freedom of expression; while
      in the Soviet Bloc, the publishing industry, firmly embedded within the
     command economy, could only ever be a vehicle for party propaganda.
      However, that freedom of expression in western Europe, coupled with the
     low costs of entry in setting up a publishing company to those with energy,
      insight and creativity, led to the establishment of many new publishers in the
      late 1950s and early 1960s. In France, the development of the paperback as
      an agent in the democratization of knowledge came late: Livre de Poche (an
     imprint of Hachette) was founded in 1953 and its success in stimulating
     volume sales was swiftly emulated by others. French publishers also belatedly

 tunities presented by the growth of supermarkets in the 1960s (followed
 eventually by hypermarkets) to widen the range of consumers. However,
 the process of consolidation also continued, increasing the dominance of
 Hachette and Presses de la Cité who were more able than their smaller
 competitors to take advantage of new opportunities. As in Germany and
 the US, the drive to growth characteristic of the twentieth-century company
 eventually led both Hachette and Presses de la Cité to seek new markets
 outside the limited ecumene of la francophonie. The former became part of
 the Lagardére media group in 1981, merged with the smaller Hatier group in
 1996 and took over Larousse in 2004.
  It also expanded into the rest of Europe through the acquisition of Salvat in
 Spain in 1988, the Orion group in the UK in 1998 and Hodder Headline in
 2004 before crossing the Atlantic with the takeover of the Time Warner Book
 Group (principally Little, Brown and Company) in 2006. Larousse had
 originally been part of the Presses de la Cité group after a merger in 1988 to
 form the second-largest publishing company in France (after Hachette) and
 the tenth largest by turnover globally. However, Presses de la Cité was in turn
 taken over by the hyper-ambitious Vivendi, formerly a water company that
 had used its under-exploited assets to invest heavily in. broadcast media
 and film, particularly after the deregulation of the telecommunications indus-
 try in France in 1998 following the Anglo-American precedent. Vivendi over-
 extended itself with acquisitions in the US, including Houghton Mifflin
 (2001), and in the early twenty-first century held a fire sale of its companies.
Lagardére bought 40 per cent of its publishing interests (Larousse) in 2004
 and the balance, including overseas companies, enjoyed four years of inde-
pendence as the newly minted Editis before being taken over by the Spanish
Planeta group. Editis remains the second-largest publishing company in
France while Planeta, having moved decisively into Anglophone as well as
Francophone publishing, stands in eighth position in the global league table
 of publishers.
 The development of this uppermost level of the palimpsest contains little
that is exclusive to the publishing business. Models of the acquisitive corpora-
tion existed, and exist, in other sectors of the economy. So too models of the
movement from national to postcolonial to globalized can be found in other
sectors such as the car or pharmaceutical industry. It bears some resemblance
to the organizational theorist Kenichi Ohmae’s five-stage model of globaliza-
tion: the export-orientated company in stage one opens up overseas branches
in stage two before in stage three relocating production to key markets, where
                       a

      stage five to create the globalized, transnational corporation. However, pub-
      lishers do not necessarily manufacture standardized products such as cars
      or pharmaceuticals. They are Kulturverlage: supporters of a culture while
      remaining commercial in outlook. The case of Harlequin demonstrates a
      respect for the distinctiveness of markets in cultural as well as linguistic terms.
       Yet the pressure to produce content that can be sold globally remains. The
      culture, created and contributed to by publishers without determining
      whether the chicken or egg comes first, can be a global culture as much as a
      national one: a global culture of English boy wizards, Catalan Gothic and
      Scandinavian noir. It has also to be recognized that linguistic distinctiveness is
      not a necessary condition for the sustenance and maintenance of cultural
      distinctiveness. The lack of a separate language may handicap the evolution
      of a distinct culture, including literature, but it does not prevent it as the
      examples of Austria, Ireland and the Hispanophone countries of South
      America demonstrate in their various ways. The notion that language was
      essential to the growth of national consciousness stems from the work of
      Benedict Anderson. Anderson posits that the coming of print in the late
      fifteenth century created an ‘imagined community’ that was linguistic. Print
      established a uniform, fixed written language shared by all within that com-
      munity but that was based on the language practices of the secular centres of
      power. The linguistic communities, cohering around and ruled by those
      centres, formed nation states.*® Contrary to Anderson, however, the gradual
      decline of Latin as a transnational written language was fuelled more by the
      Reformation and Enlightenment than any sense of nationalism. And no such
      obstacles in the path of the onward march of the English language have yet
      appeared on the horizon. As its use expands, English can become the channel
       to this global culture — in books as much as in films or television programmes.
      Non-Anglophone publishers work within a marketplace that is self-
      restricted by their language. This has been an advantage in at least two
      ways. First, the established language or languages protected key areas of
      culture and education from the invasion of material produced in English
      and offered at relatively lower prices (through economies of scale and in
      particular lower unit costs only partially offset by transportation charges).
      Second, local publishers could profit from the international success of books
     by Dan Brown or J. K. Rowling by buying up the particular language rights
      and seizing a monopoly in, say, the Bulgarian or Turkish markets. Local
      imprints of transnationals could benefit in a similar manner in translating
      and selling content already owned by their parent company. The defence of
      language, in other words, both protected the internal market and allowed
      these local publishers to boost their income through the introduction of

```

```
     linguistic defence is breaking down; the use of English has seeped from
 international trade and business into Higher Education with its own interna-
 tional aspirations and now explicit purpose in preparing graduates for work
 often in transnational businesses. It is spreading into other levels of educa-
 tion — how otherwise could students be prepared intensively enough before
 entering Higher Education to benefit from its English-medium teaching? Its
 use in textbooks at all levels (except perhaps kindergarten) is constantly
 reinforced in many countries through music, film and television. Over 80
 per cent of the material available online is in English, a further factor con-
 solidating the hegemony of the English language. Companies like Hachette
 and Bertelsmann and Planeta, arising from national bases, might seem, then,
 to be farsighted in their strategic acquisitions of companies that give them
 strong positions within this transnational market for English-language trade
 publications, whether print or e-book. In fact, the growth of the latter will
 simply accelerate the consolidation of transnational publishing as described
 above.
  The twin processes of technical and linguistic change are mutually reinfor-
 cing. They are creating not only digital natives but also near-native users, and
 therefore readers, of English. This generation need not restrict itself to
 English-language textbooks: it represents a market for English-language
 trade publishing as well. The market for translation rights in new, English-
 language science fiction novels has now disappeared. Readers of this genre of
 fiction in France, Germany and Spain prefer to read the original than wait for
 a translation; and the print book or e-book can be quickly or instantly theirs
 through an online retailer such as Amazon. The time-lag between English-
 language publication and French translation of Harry Potter and the Order of
 the Phoenix led to the English version becoming the number one children’s
 bestseller in France in the interval. The same thing happened in Germany on
 the publication of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. These may be
 particular instances and, indeed, examination of the sheer quantity of
 English-language titles on the shelves of bookshops in many European cities
 might be regarded as anecdotal and unsystematic. However, it should give
 pause for thought while we wait for more comprehensive evidence for reading
 in English substituting for reading in the native tongue. What can be stressed
 here is the huge potential for such substitution, as opposed to additionality, as
 a rational outcome of the development of transnational publishing since the
 beginning of the twentieth century.
  Governments can counterbalance external forces, linguistic and commercial,
 by privileging national and regional companies and products without infringing

      of transnational culture, including media integration of product development
      and marketing, threatens small-nation linguistic and cultural diversity.
      International organizations recognise that this would be to our global detri-
      ment. However, they also acknowledge globalization as actually an impedi-
      ment to choice within the marketplace and therefore licence intervention.
      Increased transnational flows of books are a challenge to an open marketplace,
      particularly in the sense that economies of scale will nearly always enable larger
      publishers, with the cooperation of larger booksellers, to supplant the smaller.
     Government, directly or through its agencies, must then take up the responsi-
      bility for maintaining the open marketplace by preventing the development of
      cartels, both those that seek to dominate the entire cycle and those that operate
      across media; and by ensuring freedom of expression for writers and a con-
      comitant freedom of choice for readers. There is a nexus here of economic,
      social and cultural responsibility through which national and regional govern-
      ments must ensure diversity by applying mechanisms to fill the gap between
      social and cultural benefits and market viability.
       Even those countries that have strengthened their cultural defences at a
      national level, through exploitation of the ‘cultural exception’ from free trade
      agreements, in setting up content quota or other systems of control, find it
      difficult to maintain these because of the lack of borders online. The movement
      away from centralized (and limited) broadcasting services, for example, to the
      decentralized (and seemingly unlimited) availability of material on the internet
      has made a mockery of such protectionist systems. The growth of English
      reading as substitution rather than addition will be hastened by the existing
     dominance in the global market of English-language e-books; and the present
      state systems of protection and support for non-English writing and publishing
      are based on print and on national borders, both of which represent a situation
      that is passing. Transnational publishers seek even now, not just the big book,
      in terms of its bestselling status, like J. K. Rowling or Dan Brown, but the
      transnational bestseller so that profits can be optimized across the globe. That
      bestseller need not originate in English, as the example of Stieg Larsson’s
     Millennium Trilogy illustrates; but it must be marketable in English. The
      transnational groups seek material that is marketable in English across national
      and regional borders, in print or as e-book, because either it is not too culturally
      specific or, on the contrary, it is sufficiently specific to satisfy the literary, chair-
     bound tourist. The nomothetic gain from the publishing history of the twen-
      tieth century may lie, not so much in developing a robustly theorized account of
      the development of the transnationals themselves, their growth and changing
      patterns of ownership, but in the definition of such publishers as Kulturverlage
      contributing to a global rather than a national culture.

 store. By the end of the year it had sold approximately half-a-million dollars’
 worth of books. That same year Apple Computers was struggling to stay
 afloat in the wake of the expensive development, and commercial failure, of
 the Newton, a hand-held computing device. At the time it would have been
 difficult to see the two events as connected, but from the vantage point of
 nearly two decades later we can recognize them as pivotal moments in the
 history of the electronic book. In 2014, Apple and Amazon are two of the
 key competitors not just in the sale of electronic books, but also in the design
 and manufacturing of hardware used to read those books, and in the greater
 network infrastructure that underlies our digital lives. What happened
 between 1995 and now?
  To help understand the rise of the e-book, this chapter will begin by
 examining the tangled relationships between authors, publishers, electronic
 content retailers, hardware and software developers, legal systems and others
 that have all played a part in the development of the digital book. In this
 regard the study of the history of e-books is no different from other fields of
 study that fit within the rubric of book history, crossing as it does boundaries
 between literary, historical, economic and material branches of research.
 However, to see book historians as mere commentators on electronic tex-
 tuality would be to miss the many important contributions that scholars are
 making in the creation and use of new electronic reading technologies. This
 chapter is devoted primarily to scholarly reactions to the electronic book and
 the resultant explosion in studies of both the past and future of the book.
  In the same year that Bezos was launching Amazon, the literary scholar
 Jerome McGann published ‘The Rationale of Hypertext’, a powerful case for
 the advantages of harnessing computing technologies for the study of paper
 books and other non-digital media: ‘the electronic environment of hyperedit-

      contain multimedia objects, and in subsequent work, such as his Complete
      Writings and Pictures of Dante Gabriel Rossetti, he has shown just how
      useful electronic scholarly resources can be.
      Within McGann’s statement, however, there are also traces of another
      discourse that surrounded the electronic text as it emerged in the 1990s,
      that of liberation and constraint (‘frees’ and ‘limits’). To its proponents, the
      electronic text was going to usher in a new age of democracy, an age where
     information would no longer be imprisoned within books and libraries. These
     proclamations of the ‘death of the book’ were met from the other side by
     passionate pleas for the beauty of printed books and the romance of reading
      as opposed to the cold embrace of the computer.
      Balance has been introduced into the argument by book historians and
      others who, while acknowledging the individual strengths of both the elec-
      tronic and the paper book, refused to divide them into separate, opposing,
      objects. The rise of the electronic book must be studied in the light of the
     emergence of other media types, such as the printed book and the newspaper.
     These scholars show that the codex does not automatically imprison informa-
      tion in a fixed form, nor is the electronic text by default flexible and open to
       all. Most importantly, they are demonstrating that the electronic text still has
     much to ‘learn’ from the paper book when it comes to organizing informa-
      tion. And, rather than commenting on the electronic book from the margins,
     many of these scholars are following McGann’s model and becoming actively
     engaged in the creation of new reading environments. Like the scholar-
      printers of previous generations who studied the history of printing in order
      to make better books, these scholar-coders are helping to shape the future of
      the book by looking at its past.*
               A short history of the e-book
     As with most significant inventions, determining ‘the’ first appearance of the
      electronic book is difficult and not without controversy. Vannevar Bush’s
     concept of a memex, which he proposed in ‘As We May Think’ in the July
      1945 issue of Atlantic Monthly, is generally considered the foundation of the
      electronic text as we have come to know it: ‘A memex is a device in which an
      individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is
     mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility’.
     Bush imagined a machine that not only contained books, but that allowed
      the user to link items into a trail of related content. This idea of linking
      inspired Ted Nelson and Douglas Englebart, independently, to develop the
      notion of the computerized hypertext link, which is the basis of internet

                                         — it
 based on microfilm and other photographic technologies. The first truly
 digital texts were the result of the collaboration of Father Roberto Busa, a
 Jesuit priest, and Thomas Watson, the founder of IBM. Busa was interested in
 linguistically analysing the complete works of Thomas Aquinas, and
 approached Watson to see if computers could be used for this purpose. Up
 until this point computers had been strictly designed and used for mathema-
 tical calculations. Watson initially balked at the idea, but Busa convinced
 him to become a partner in the project, and together they made digital text
 possible.°
  With text-based computing becoming reality, the next several decades saw
 the development of numerous systems for the creation and manipulation of
 electronic texts. At the same time various groups were working towards
 building communications networks for computer sites (one must remember
 that at the time computers were both extremely large and expensive, and
 therefore generally owned and operated by institutions and not individuals).
 These two strands of development came together in 1971 when Michael Hart,
 a student at the University of Illinois, used his institutional mainframe, which
 was part of the ARPANET research network, to create Project Gutenberg, a
 repository for electronic texts, and to post as its first text an electronic version
 of the United States Declaration of Independence.
  In the mid- to late 1970s affordable personal computers, such as the
 Commodore PET, Apple II and Radio Shack TRS-80, came on the market,
 and electronic text became available to the general public. Not only could
 users of these machines create and save electronic documents using word
 processing programs, much of the entertainment value of the machines was
 derived from text-based games, such as Adventureland and Colossal Cave
 Adventure, that users could either buy or program for themselves by typing in
 the source code printed in computer magazines. Despite the extraordinary
 popularity of these games, which showed that people were willing to spend
 significant time reading from a screen, and the fact that authors were increas-
 ingly using computers to write their manuscripts, the personal computer was
 not seen by publishers as a viable reading device.° There were works of
 literature released on disc — most notably, Eastgate System’s 1987 release of
 Michael Joyce’s Afternoon, a work which used hypertext links, and William
 Gibson’s 1992 Agrippa (a Book of the Dead), which was ona disc that erased
 itself after being read — but outside of these literary experiments no major
 publisher committed to publishing electronic texts.”
  As the CD-ROM became established as the replacement for the floppy disc

     encyclopedias such as Microsoft’s Encarta achieved a degree of success. This
     period also saw the release of the first dedicated e-reader, the Sony BookMan
      in 1992, but few titles for it were ever made available and it was soon
     discontinued.
       This same period saw the emergence of the world wide web, a network of
      linked documents on the internet, and with it an explosion of readily acces-
      sible electronic text. In 1991 Tim Berners-Lee launched the first website, and
      in 1993 the first graphical browser, Mosaic, made it possible for websites to
     contain both images and text. Scholars like Jerome McGann seized upon the
     new technology to start making literary hypertext editions on the web. The
     web also enabled e-commerce, and with it the means for publishers to sell and
      distribute electronic texts without requiring customers to purchase discs from
      bookstores. The Softbook, the Rocket eBook and other e-reading devices
     came on the market in the late 1990s, and major publishers Barnes and
     Noble, Time Warner and Random House opened electronic book divisions.
      In 2000 Stephen King released Riding the Bullet, the first mass-market novel
     published exclusively electronically and, despite the servers crashing because
      of demand, it sold over 400,000 copies in the first day. The day of the e-book
     seemed to have arrived.
      Not even a year later those same publishers closed their electronic text
      divisions, citing a lack of sales. When asked to explain the failure of
      e-publishing, Time Warner’s Larry Kirshbaum believed it was because of
      the inadequacy of reading devices: ‘The real problem is a technology issue.
     No reading device comes close to reproducing the experience of reading a
      book.’’ While commercial publishers waited for a solution to their hardware
     problems, in 2004 Google announced plans to digitize millions of books
      starting with the collections housed in the Harvard, Stanford, Oxford,
      University of Michigan and New York Public libraries. Public outcry and
      lawsuits quickly followed, as claims of copyright infringement were made and
      concerns over Google building a monopoly on information were raised. Legal
      settlements have been made and overturned, but Google (and other agencies
     such as the Internet Archive) continue to digitize books. As of 2013 they had
     scanned 30 million books.
      The major technological hurdles facing the development of a viable
      e-reader were cleared up by the middle of the 2000s. Electronic paper, some-
      times called e-ink, allowed for a screen that closely resembled the printed page
     and required little energy, thereby extending battery life. Rechargeable bat-
      teries were becoming smaller, lighter and more powerful. Solid-state memory
     eliminated the need for a hard drive or disc. And cellular data networks and
      wireless internet meant that the device did not need to be connected to a

 the distribution of content, Amazon was able to avoid the problems that had
 doomed the previous generation of e-readers, and their model was soon
 copied by others, such as Barnes and Noble and Apple. Within three years
 Amazon was selling more e-books than paper books, and the greatest chal-
 lenge to the e-reader became tablet computers and smart phones, devices that
 could provide additional functionality. The e-book publishing business is still
 evolving, as evident in the 2012 United States Department of Justice’s accusa-
 tions that Apple colluded with publishers to fix e-book prices, but it is safe to
 say that electronic books have become a part of the mainstream reading
 experience.
             The death of the book?
 As we have just seen, the development and eventual commercial success of the
 electronic book can be discussed in terms of technological innovation, pub-
 lishing economics and legal challenges. But to more fully understand the
 impact of the digital book on society we must also look at the reactions of
 readers and writers to this change, for it is they who, in the end, choose to use
 the screen or the paper page. That they have not been unanimous in welcom-
 ing the new technology is evident from E. Annie Proulx’s proclamation in the
 New York Times on 26 May 1994 that ‘[nJobody is going to sit down and
 read a novel on a twitchy little screen. Ever.’
  The rise of the personal computer in the 1980s and the creation of the
 world wide web in the early 1990s led some to forecast that the ‘death of
 the book’ was at hand. This was not the first time that the book’s primacy as
 the carrier for knowledge was seen as under threat — it having previously been
 threatened by the newspaper, motion picture and television, to name just a
 few. In The Gutenberg Galaxy (1962) and other works, Marshall McLuhan
 postulated that just as ancient and medieval modes of thinking had been
 radically altered by the inventions of writing and printing, the effects of new
 electronic modes of communication such as the creation of a ‘global village’
 needed to be studied in order to avoid their negative consequences: ‘Instead of
 tending towards a vast Alexandrian library the world has become a compu-
 ter, an electronic brain... And as our senses have gone outside us, Big Brother
 goes inside. So, unless aware of this dynamic, we shall at once move into a
 phase of panic terrors, exactly befitting of a small world of tribal drums, total
 interdependence, and super-imposed co-existence.’”? Central to McLuhan’s
 argument was a belief that changes [in ][technology, ] [especially ] [communications ]
 technologies, must profoundly way people, and

      This technological determinism was echoed by later critics seeking to
     explain how the forms of media influence their reception and use. Most
     notably, in her landmark 1979 study The Printing Press as an Agent of
     Change, Elizabeth Eisenstein argued that the shift from manuscript to print
     had been fundamental to, among other things, the scientific revolution,
     the Renaissance and the Protestant Reformation. As will be seen later,
     Eisenstein’s theories are not universally accepted, but they have been tremen-
     dously influential; a clear example of this influence was seen at the end of the
     1990s when Johannes Gutenberg, the man generally considered the inventor
     of the printing press, was named by numerous sources including Time as the
     most influential person of the second millennium.
      This belief that one communications technology can completely supersede
     another, and in the process radically change society, is at the heart of all
     discussions (both for and against) that claim that the computer is a threat to
     the book. As this discourse emerged in the 1990s, proponents of electronic
      text cast ‘the book’ as a restriction on both authors and readers, and proposed
     that the computer and electronic text would liberate both those who create
     and use texts and the texts themselves. George Landow, one of the first
     literary scholars to widely publicize hypertext as a medium for scholarship
     and education, argued that because hypertext systems allow readers to choose
      their own path through a text, and to become authors in their own right, they
     ‘intrinsically promote a new kind of academic freedom and empowerment’.
     Jay David Bolter compared the permanence of the physical book with the
     seeming ephemerality of the electronic text, which exists only on the screen,
     and concluded that ‘[a]ll information, all data, in the computer world is a kind
     of controlled movement, and so the natural inclination of computer writing is
      to change’. Similarly, in The Electronic Word: Democracy, Technology, and
      the Arts, Richard Lanham wrote of the transition to electronic text as ‘a
     movement from the fixed and silent signal of the printed book to a richer
     but more volatile signal, writing + voice + image, of digital display’.‘° For
     these scholars the fixed nature of the printed book, which Eisenstein credited
     for enabling so many of the intellectual:advances in the centuries following
     the invention of printing, was now a prison for information. Electronic texts,
     which exist ephemerally on screens and on networks, promised to free read-
      ers, authors and even information from the book’s shackles and to create a
     new era of democratic knowledge creation and sharing.
      This techno-utopianism elicited outrage from bibliophiles who worried
     about the material book, and what it represented to them, disappearing.
     The best-known of these responses is The Gutenberg Elegies: The Fate of
     Reading in an Electronic Age, by Sven Birkerts. As evident from the title,

 rush of impulses through freshly minted circuits’. For Birkerts, and many
 others, the printed book is not a prison but a means of escape, and reading is
 as much about the contemplative act as it is about navigating to the correct
 snippet of information. Along with the loss of the ‘joy’ of reading, Birkerts
 feared that, by exchanging the traditional close reading of specific texts for a
 broad reading practice based on foraging through a wide swath of networked
 texts, society is moving from a search for wisdom to just placing ‘faith in the
 web’.** Rather than resulting in freedom, the death of the book will result ina
 loss of individuality.
  The attitude of the staunch electronic text supporters to book lovers such as
 Birkerts was perhaps best summed up by William J. Mitchell’s description of
 them as ‘addicted to the look and feel of tree flakes encased in dead cow’.’*
 However it is interesting to note that both sides of the argument are based
 strongly upon the materiality, or supposed lack thereof, of the textual object.
 To their detractors physical books are seen as limiting because their pages
 are sequential and their content finite. Electronic books, by comparison, are
 boundless and multilinear. But for those concerned about the potential death
 of the book, the physical form of the book acts as a valuable carrier of
 information and can be tremendously important to the reading experience,
 while the impermanence of the electronic text lessens its long-term cultural
 impact and ease of use. E-book detractors like E. Annie Proulx have also been
 quick to point out that e-texts do have a material form — the hardware used to
 create and read them — and this hardware is not without its problems.** With
 this emphasis on materiality it is not surprising that bibliographers and book
 historians, whose core idea according to Leslie Howsam is ‘that the material
 form of a text affects (and to some extent effects) the meaning attached to it by
 the recipient’, began to examine the electronic text and to change the debate
 from whether the end of the book was at hand to a more nuanced discussion
 of how various forms of text, including electronic, change over time and
 influence each other.**
         Book history and the electronic book
 Early in the first of his Panizzi lectures, D. F. McKenzie asserts that ‘it would
 now be more useful to describe bibliography as the study of the sociology of
 texts’. One paragraph later, he begins to unpack the larger implications of this
 proposed definition by focusing [acutely ] [on ] [what ] [he ][means ] [by ][texts: ] [‘I ][define ]
 “texts” to include verbal, visual, [oral, ][and ] [numeric ] [data, ] [in ][the ][form ] [of ][maps, ]

     forms of discography. There is no evading the challenge which those new
     forms have created.’*>
      That McKenzie included such a diverse range of media under the rubric of
      text should not come as a surprise, especially given the panoptic nature of his
     argument, but that he considered computer-stored information and other
     electronic media as subjects fit for bibliographical analysis seems especially
     prescient for the time. Nearly twenty-five years later, when Matthew
     Kirschenbaum explained in the introduction to his Mechanisms: New Media
     and the Forensic Imagination, that ‘the methodology for the book draws
     heavily from bibliography and textual criticism ... scholarly fields dedicated
      to the study of books as physical objects and the reconstruction and representa-
      tion of texts from multiple versions and witnesses (sometimes collectively called
      “textual studies”)’, he was responding, whether consciously or not, to
     McKenzie’s call from decades earlier.‘° That Kirschenbaum offered a meth-
     odological statement for his specialized study of digital media was unremark-
      able, but that he insisted repeatedly on the centrality of bibliography and textual
     criticism to his research suggests that, in 2009, such approaches required
     explanation. In this section, we show that Mechanisms represented less of an
     epiphany and more a fuller realization of what a number of scholars had been
     suggesting (if not always acting upon) for two decades or more since McKenzie
     included electronic media under the purview of the sociology of texts.
      Disciplinary reconciliation is often less the result of scholars coming
     together than it is the consequence of scholarly gesturing, and in this case
     the rethinking of the relationship between the digital and predigital textual
     forms. In book history, humanities computing and information studies there
     have been, and still are, voices who argue that new technologies like the
     e-book need to be seen as an important stage in a long, interconnected
     continuum of textual forms and that new technologies will likely coexist
     with, rather than replace, earlier media. Such assessments often derive from
     an historical analysis of reactions to technological change, particularly how
      societies have worked with different media during periods of transition and
     how they responded to these moments. What follows is a sampling of those
     scholars who insist that we look to the history of the book, or to the methods
     of bibliography and textual studies, to better understand the structures and
     processes of digital media. There has been significant work conducted in this
      field, and that work continues as we write. Therefore, this discussion should
     be regarded as representative rather than comprehensive.
      Paul Duguid’s oft-cited essay ‘Material Matters: The Past and Futurology
     of the Book’ is a response to the supersessionist arguments of his day.*7
     Writing in the mid-nineties, Duguid argued that the then recent predictions

```

-----

```
              inevitable obsolescence of older technologies. To
 illustrate his point, Duguid showed how prognosticators of the early twen-
 tieth century believed the typewriter would replace the pencil, and that the
 sliding door would signal the end of the hinged door. These predictions
 proved wrong as each of the older technologies continued to function. As
 for the source of the prediction, Duguid pointed to a series of misconceptions:
 that older technologies are simpler, and newer ones complex; that new
 technologies naturally supersede rather than coexist with older ones; and
 that new technologies offer a form of liberty that the older ones fail to
 provide. This last point is particularly powerful, for it is tied to a larger binary
 that sees the new as synonymous with innovation and human progress, and
 the old with backwardness and stagnation. In place of a rhetoric of alter-
 natives, Duguid suggested that any study of technology should not be treated
 in isolation, but rather be seen as part of the larger social and historical
 contexts from which it emerged. Similar gesturing is present in the work of
 John Lavagnino when he writes: ‘Electronic texts aren’t the free-for-all that
 we are often led to imagine: just like printed texts, they are created, read, and
 transmitted within systems we didn’t create, that influence us and that we can
 fully break out of only through the exertion of extraordinary effort’.'® The
 lesson offered by both writers, which was often ignored in the 1990s, was that
 the new electronic media shared much with earlier textual forms, and that
 studying the past was thus crucial to understanding the present.
  While writers like Duguid and Lavagnino would call for a more contextual-
 ized and nuanced understanding of electronic texts, others such as Paul
 Erickson and Adrian van der Weel would focus specifically on the absence of
 book history in treatments of electronic media. Writing in 2003, Paul Erickson
 argued that ‘book historians, along with other scholars, had paid virtually no
 attention to how the physical means of transmitting electronic texts influences
 their meaning’, and that such an analysis was essential since the ‘familiar
 models used for text production, circulation and consumption in both manu-
 script and print, as the channels of transmission are very different in electronic
 media’.*? Two years later, Adrian van der Weel would make a similar case by
 arguing for a closer study of the book’s ‘digital transformation’ within a book
 history framework. Unlike Erickson, however, van der Weel’s focus was on the
 continuities existing between predigital and digital forms. He noted, for exam-
 ple, that e-media formed the latest chapter in a continuum of textual transmis-
 sion dating back to manuscript and other early forms of inscription. He further
 contended that since bibliography already had an established set of theoretical
 models and established vocabulary for describing different aspects of textual

     Lavagnino, Erickson and van der Weel all provided important cases for how the
      established methodologies of bibliography and book history might be used and
      adapted to discuss digital media, they also emphasized the larger social contexts
      in which media change occurs. Significantly, they all cited McKenzie and his
      theory of the sociology of texts in their works.
       For the last decade, some of the most innovative scholarship emerging in
      the digital humanities community has come from individuals championing
      the history of the book, seeing this complex interdiscipline not only as a
      precursor to our current technologies, but as an essential touchstone for
     understanding how those technologies work. By foregrounding materiality
      as an essential hermeneutic for thinking about electronic media, Matthew
     Kirschenbaum, for example, has reminded us of the ‘embodied inscriptions’
      found in ‘digital data’. ‘Phenomena we call virtual’, writes Kirschenbaum,
      ‘are in fact physical phenomena lacking the appropriate mediation to supple-
     ment wave-length optics; that is, the naked eye’.** While the computer and
      printed codex are very different things, nevertheless they are both physical
      materials shaped by processes and are thus subject to similar forms of inves-
      tigation. What makes Kirschenbaum different from the earlier critics dis-
      cussed above is the way he conceives of materiality. For example, while
     Lavagnino anticipated Kirschenbaum by noting that ‘Electronic texts do
      preserve significant traces of their transmission, and we can learn to recognize
      those indications and make deductions from them about the history of texts’,
      his ultimate conclusion was that ‘these indications are not “physical”’.
      Erickson too suggested that, ‘if we are to understand anything about how
      people read electronic media in the future, it is crucial that we try and under-
      stand it now, since almost all forms of evidence that historians of the book
      rely on to learn about reading in the past — marginalia, borrowing records
      from libraries, diary entries — do not and will not exist for most electronic
      media’.** While Erickson’s concerns are valid, they fail to grasp the extent to
     which electronic storage can capture instantiations of a writer’s work, a point
     Kirschenbaum explores in detail through a central and unavoidable lesson of
      his book: it is difficult to erase in digital environments.
       Delete, trash or burn a file, and still a trace remains. The problem is not so
     much ensuring that files survive, but rather having the knowledge of where to
      search for them when they seem to have disappeared. By applying (rather
      than just gesturing towards) the methodological tools traditionally reserved
      for the study of books to electronic media, Kirschenbaum draws attention to
      the continuities and discontinuities between the two forms. In place of the
      familiar narrative that envisions how new digital forms eclipse old paper
      ones, Kirschenbaum reminds us how materiality can serve as a common

 nounced in the work of Johanna Drucker, as she also looks to the humanities
 for a theoretical framework while testing, building and prototyping digital
 tools in a laboratory environment. In her book Speclab: Digital Aesthetics
 and Projects in Speculative Computing, Drucker offers a counterpoint to the
 objectivity of early humanities computing, arguing for the importance of
 aesthetics and subjectivity in the digital work that leads to knowledge pro-
 duction. Much of that argument is documented through Drucker’s experi-
 ences as an established art practitioner and art historian working at the
 University of Virginia’s Speculative Computing Lab in the late 1990s and
 early 2000s. Virginia’s laboratory was essential to the formation of what we
 now call the digital humanities as figures such as Jerome McGann, Bethany
 Nowviskie and John Unsworth oversaw and collaborated with others on
 groundbreaking projects such as the Rossetti and Blake Archives, while
 supervising the work of second-generation digital humanists. At Virginia,
 and now at the University of California, Los Angeles, Drucker continues to
 make practitioners rethink the methods they bring to bear in the digital
 humanities, while critiquing the design and function of the tools they rely
 upon. When discussing e-books, for instance, she notes:
  Their limitations have stemmed in part from a flawed understanding of what
  traditional books are. There has been too much emphasis on formal replication
  of layout, graphic and physical features and too little analysis of how those
  features affect the book’s function. Rather than thinking about simulating the
  way a book Jooks, then, designers might do well to consider extending the ways
  a book works.
 And one way they might extend such thinking, Drucker continues, is by
 turning away from iconic metaphors associated with the codex (turning the
 page etc.) to focus on the functions unique to electronic environments (real-
 time refresh, live links etc.). In other words, e-books are ideal when they are
 customized to take advantage of the technological potential of electronic
 environments and designed to account for the practices and activities of
 users.*?
  Like Drucker, Katherine N. Hayles has also emphasized the importance of
 functionality as a signifier in digital reading environments, and like
Kirschenbaum, she has noted the importance of materiality in such discus-
 sions. In an important article of 2003, Hayles argues adamantly that a
remediation from print to digital [amounts ] [to ] [a ] [complete ] [translation, ] [one ]

     been a central focus of much of the recent scholarship that bridges the gap
    between book history and digital humanities.
     Many of the studies described above have coincided with more nuanced
    understandings of traditional media. Indeed, another important influence on
     the rethinking of digital text comes from studies of the early printed codex,
    and particularly those that reassess the relationship between manuscript and
     print in the first centuries of print. In Print, Manuscript and the Search for
    Order 1450-1830, David McKitterick describes the introduction of print as
     ‘a period in which we frequently find less a revolution than an accommoda-
     tion’, one where ‘the boundary between manuscript and print is as untidy
     chronologically, as it is commercially, materially and socially’. This demon-
     strates that ‘in practice, each new technology does not replace the previous
     one. Rather it augments it and offers alternatives.’ Similar to McKitterick,
    Adrian Johns offered an important reassessment of print culture, one that not
     only took account of the coexistence of different media, including manu-
     script, but one that also showed print production as a messier, more unstable
    and iterative process than earlier studies allowed. Just as later scholars of
     digital media had reassessed the work of early hypertext theorists, Johns and
     others offered new readings of earlier seminal studies on print, including most
     notably the work of Elizabeth Eisenstein.** It is no coincidence that the
    e-book is now conceived as more material, while the print-book is being
     defined as less stable.
     The most recent revolutions in the biblio-materiality of digital books and
     related media have often involved a kind of balancing act. As some scholars
     scrutinize the most granular aspects of digital storage, and others focus on the
     logic and function of the digital page, both sets of scholars are often attuned to
     the importance of predigital forms in their thinking about digital media. For
    example, Kirschenbaum puts his training in bibliography and book history to
     use, while Drucker’s expertise in graphic design and artist books informs her
     thinking of the graphics of digital texts. It is in this context that new digitally
     informed, team-based book history projects such as Implementing New
    Knowledge Environments (INKE) have emerged. In a recent article entitled
    ‘Beyond Remediation: The Role of Textual Studies in New Knowledge
    Environments’, members of INKE look at predigital forms as templates for
     the modelling of future reading environments, while also insisting that scholars
    make the most of digital innovations instead of simply creating electronic
     simulacra of the codex. For example, there are numerous instances in the
    early-modern period, such as the printing of George Herbert’s ‘Easter Wings’,
    where books were either printed in landscape orientation or designed to be

```

```
   readers. However, computer screens have, until very recently, been designed to
   be used in only the landscape orientation, and even tablet devices, with their
   ability to be rotated from horizontal to vertical orientations, have thus far had
   few applications that take advantage of this feature in any meaningful way.?°
    The open-access, peer-reviewed resource, Architectures of the Book, or
   ArchBook (www.archbook.ca), one of INKE’s original initiatives, similarly
   argues for the importance of the past as a vital resource for current digital
   thinking. In a typical ArchBook essay, an author will survey the history of a
   specific textual feature (e.g. manicules, table of contents, variorum commen-
   taries) ‘but with an eye to the continuities and discontinuities that feature
   might have with current digital environments’. Part journal, part blog,
   part repository, ArchBook is itself a composite of traditional and emerging
   approaches to scholarly publication. Evidence of the influence of textual
   studies on the creation of digital interfaces is INKE’s work towards creating
   the ‘Social Edition’, an editing platform that encourages collaboration and
   community engagement in the scholarly edition.*” Members of the group
   working towards this new interface have also spent several years studying the
   Devonshire Manuscript, a collection of verse written and compiled by a
   community of women and men living in sixteenth-century England, and
   have published a collaborative scholarly edition of the manuscript.**® As a
   community of textual editors working on a text created by a literary commu-
   nity, they are in a good position to begin to model future editing environments
   that will both enable historical modes of collaboration and create new means
   for scholarly engagement.
    INKE is not the only group working in this area; the Open Annotation
   Collaboration and the Institute for the Future of the Book, to mention two
   currently active groups, also bring book history into their work to varying
   degrees, and a quick perusal of the programme for any recent textual studies
   conference will reveal numerous individuals similarly engaged. With one foot
   in the past and one in the future, one eye on new media and one on older
   forms, these scholars gesture towards a future where digital humanists and
   historians of the book combine forces to study and build new reading envir-
   onments. Such cooperation is not only healthy: it is necessary.

            MICHAEL FoSUAREZ, S.J.
    Book history from descriptive
        bibliographies
  Every bibliography tells a book-historical story. The trick is learning how to
  read a volume that at first glance appears to belong among the most off-
  putting of genres, the most boring material in the library. For a start, biblio-
  graphies seem to be little more than lists — and repetitious lists at that. To
  make matters worse, here in the pages of a humanities book, a learned tome
  shelved in familiar precincts of the library, is print that definitely looks as
   if it belongs in the mathematics or engineering section: 4°: m* A-3C* 3D’;
  [$2 (+P3) signed]; 200 leaves, pp. [4] 1-395 [1]. This may seem distinctly
   unfair, because many of us book historians went into the humanities in part
  because we found algebra uncongenial and calculus unkind. A collation
  formula (which is what that string of signs is) is a slightly weird, short-hand
  way of describing the structure and completeness of a book. We won’t discuss
  collation formulas in this chapter, however.
   My aim in these pages is to alert the reader to the usefulness, even indispens-
   ability at times, of reading — not just dipping into — descriptive bibliographies.
  My purpose is to show how such reading will quicken book-historical under-
  standings. By discussing a few examples, I aim to rouse in the reader a sense of
  the genuine pleasures of poring over descriptive bibliographies to recognize and
  identify the latent book-historical narratives waiting to be discovered in their
  pages. I also want to explain in the clearest possible terms a few essential
  concepts that will go a long way toward helping book historians get the most
  out of descriptive bibliographies.
         More than the sum of its parts: what a good
             bibliography can do for you
   ‘T have no biography. I have only a bibliography’, observed Milorad Pavic,
  author of the international bestseller Dictionary of the Khazars.’ A well-
  executed author bibliography is far more than a mere enumeration of titles

     literary career. Dan H. Laurence, the bibliographer of Bernard Shaw, professed
     his conviction that the most significant contribution made by those who created
     modern author bibliographies is ‘the graphic recreation of the subjects’ lives
     in the context of their professional business involvement and experience; of
     their struggles and frustrations and yearnings reflected through commercial
     intercourse’ .*
      The astute student of book history who dares to read them will readily
     discern in the bibliographies of Samuel Johnson, Marianne Moore, Tom
     Stoppard or Virginia Woolf the business relationships and publishing choices
     that chiefly defined the author’s employment over a lifetime of writing.’ In
     such pages may be found not only a tally of the number and variety of books
     produced, but also information about the sale and ongoing reception of those
     works as they are reprinted over time. We may learn, for example, from
     Edwin T. Bowden’s excellent Washington Irving Bibliography that Irving’s
     The Sketch Book was published in at least seventy-six editions and subse-
     quent impressions — not including the publication of excerpts or translations —
     beginning with the appearance of the first edition in 1819 until Irving’s death
      in 1859, a remarkable indication of the author’s popular reception.* Reading
     through the many entries for translations of Irving’s writings, one can begin to
     garner valuable particulars about early markets and readerships for US
     authors in Europe and Latin America.
      Well-prepared descriptive bibliographies may provide the book historian
     with essential details about what the author was originally paid, or how much
     income he or she made from sales, and even financial data about the publish-
     ing house’s costs and profits (or losses) for particular works. Bibliographies
    commonly furnish information about original-language editions, authorial
     emendations, reviews, censorship history, serializations, abridgements, trans-
     lations for foreign markets, appearances in anthologies, prizes and awards
     and the like. Not infrequently, matters of intellectual property come into play.
    When available, descriptive bibliographies can supply otherwise difficult-to-
     find information on matters such as print runs, wholesale and retail prices,
     marketing plans or advertising patterns and other useful data from publish-
      er’s archives, printer’s ledgers, contracts, correspondence and related docu-
     ments. There is no substitute for having the facts. Because the bibliographer
     spends years travelling to libraries and archives, combing through such
     records and painstakingly examining multiple copies of books with an ana-
      lytic eye, the data that he or she marshals can save the book historian a
     tremendous amount of time and trouble.
      Bibliography thus becomes the foundation of publishing history. As prac-

```

-----

```
   affect meanings, information about format, paper, type, edition bindings,
  dust jackets and the like can valuably lead book-historical researchers to
  form significant historical inferences from painstakingly gathered and system-
   atically arrayed bibliographical evidence. Such particulars can also help when
  historians of book production, distribution and/or reading and reception
  need to examine an individual copy and identify it as belonging to a particular
   edition, impression or issue (see below). Recognizing the importance of
  bibliographical inquiry for textual criticism and scholarly editing, some bib-
  liographies helpfully record any significant textual alterations. Alan Tyson’s
  Bibliography of Beethoven (1963), for example, pays scrupulous attention to
  recording textual variants, while Edwin Bowden has taken great care in his
  Washington Irving bibliography to highlight ‘textual variants in superficially
  similar states of impressions, and revisions — particularly revisions by the
  author — in new editions’.>
    In the early days of serious Anglo-American bibliographical scholarship,
  Anthony Trollope’s bibliographer, Michael Sadleir, rightly maintained that
  descriptive ‘[b]ibliography can be extended beyond a mere descriptive analy-
   sis of any one writer or period; it can be made to illustrate, not only the
  evolution of book-building [i.e. production], but also the history of book-
  handling [i.e. the book trade] and the effect [of the publishing industry] on the
  aims and achievements of authorship’. Hence, Sadleir’s bibliography is best
  employed not only as ‘a reference work for collectors’, but also as ‘a com-
  mentary on the book and publishing crafts of mid-Victorian England’.°
  Sadleir was himself in the business of making and selling books; as the
  director of the publishing firm Constable and Robinson, he well knew that
  studying the history of a writer’s publications in detail over time could shed
  considerable light on the conditions of authorship and on the publishing
  practices of the age.
             ‘The annals of a literary career’
  An excellent example of what descriptive bibliography can do for book
  historians is David Fleeman’s Bibliography of the Works of Samuel
  Johnson, a massive work that traces the publication histories of Johnson’s
  writings, not only throughout the course of the author’s life, but for 200 years
  following his death as well. Fleeman’s [achievement ] [led ][David ] [Vander ] [Meulen ]
  to suggest that the Bibliography ‘may be the most important work of
  Johnsonian scholarship ever [written’. ] [Robert ] [DeMaria ] [was ] [no ] [less ] [fulsome ]
  in his praise when taking the measure [of ][what ] [the ] [Bibliography ] [had ] [accom- ]

```
     It is unlikely that any work on Johnson will ever achieve more’.’
      For Fleeman, the narratives that come to light through the practice of
     descriptive bibliography are part and parcel of the author’s biography. As
     he explains, his bibliography is not merely a piling up of bibliographical
     and book-historical details: ‘I have not arranged this compilation as if it
     were itself an enormous index, but rather as the annals of a literary
     career.’ Accordingly, Fleeman painstakingly delineates every instantiation
     of Johnson’s known writings over the course of more than 200 years. The
     entry for Rasselas, for example, provides the reader with a chronicle of nearly
     530 significant appearances of this novella. Among the highlights in its
    production history are publications in eighteen foreign languages across the
     nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In this instance, as in many others,
     Fleeman’s remarkable bibliography provides the foundation for constructing
     a detailed reception history of each of Johnson’s principal works. Because
     ‘{t]he popularity of Rasselas can be measured only when we have reliable
     information about the number of editions published, the kinds of markets
     they were aimed at, the adventitious inducements they offered to readers in
     the form of illustrations, the places they were published, and the languages
     into which they were translated’, what Fleeman calls ‘the business of this
     bibliography’ is absolutely indispensable for book-historical scholarship.
     Fleeman’s close attention to physical books themselves helps us to understand
     ‘not merely the mind of the author of the text, but also the activities of the
     producers of its materials, the aims of its manufacturers, and the commercial
     estimates of the requirements of its readers’. As Vander Meulen insightfully
     reminds us, it is ‘the human context that ultimately is the object of this
     historical delving’.*
       It is of cardinal importance for book historians and bibliographers alike to
     understand that transmission history is an essential aspect of reception his-
     tory. The most reliable and tractable means for scholars to comprehend the
     publication histories that embody the public presences of an author (or,
     indeed, of a publishing house) is to read and carefully analyse a well-wrought
     descriptive bibliography. The author of a bibliography, then, by focusing on
     the history of material production through the close examination of physical
     objects that constitute the surviving historical record, provides the reader not
     merely with a history of the career and reputation of his or her chosen subject,
     but also with detailed understandings both of the intended reading audiences
     for particular works and of the critical fortunes of those works.
      Thus, in a remarkable way for the book historian who pays careful atten-
     tion, we are able to discern not only Johnson’s works in history, but also the

```

  most evident in his decision to include more than 300 miniature dictionaries
  that quite dubiously claim some connection with Johnson’s great folios.
  ‘These dictionaries find their place here as illustrating Johnson’s popular
  reputation as a lexicographer’, Fleeman explains, ‘rather than for their
  uncertain debts to his work’.? Because of the bibliographical and book-
  historical industriousness of Fleeman and others who are intellectually coura-
  geous enough to dedicate their mental energies to the unglamorous but
  foundational labour of producing descriptive bibliographies, book historians
  are thus enabled to undertake the systematic study of their chosen subjects
  with a comprehensiveness and attention to revealing historical detail that was
  simply not possible before such works became part of the scholarly record.
   Fleeman’s ‘map of Johnson’s career’ also contains a wealth of information
  on paper, watermarks, composition, typography, presswork, production
  costs, retail prices (and, sometimes, trade discounts) and the operations of
  the book trade itself.*° Johnson’s Dictionary is exhaustively treated over the
  course of some 250 pages; entries for the principal lifetime editions include a
  catalogue of hundreds of press figures and of catchwords, both of which are
  especially useful for understanding the progress of the sheets through the
  press. (An adept bibliographer may also employ such information to discover
  last-minute textual revisions.) Throughout Fleeman’s work, we encounter
  evidence of a remarkable bibliographical intelligence shining light upon
  examples of shared printing, books in parts, unusual formats, duplicate
  setting and a variety of similar issues treated in concrete terms. In addition,
  there is frequently information about the bindings and provenances of the
  copies he has consulted. In many ways, then, Fleeman’s bibliography is not
  only enormously valuable in itself, constituting a kind of master-class in
  bibliography and book-trade history during the hand-press period, but also
  is sure to serve as the basis for subsequent bibliographical and book-historical
  research for many years to come.
      Bibliography becomes the foundation of publishing history

  ual author’s career; other, typical subjects include the productions of an
  individual printing firm or publishing [house, ] [a ] [specific ] [genre ] [within ] [a ] [given ]

     ings of these books on the major rivers (and river systems) of the US,
     Fitzgerald’s bibliography offers an absorbing prospect of the publishing
     business in the US over the course of some forty years.
     Perhaps remembering D. F. McKenzie’s declaration that the task of biblio-
    graphy is to reveal the human presences in recorded texts, Fitzgerald provides
    more than 120 brief biographies of individuals who contributed to the series
     as illustrators, authors or editors. For each title (e.g. The Brandywine, The
     Charles, The Hudson), there immediately follows a section providing infor-
    mation — judiciously harvested from interviews, correspondence and publish-
     ers’ archives — about such matters as: how the author and illustrator were
     chosen, the details of contracts, missed delivery deadlines, notable moments
     in the editorial process and how the book was received. Fitzgerald’s biblio-
    graphy then provides a list of reviews, a catalogue of other works by the same
     author and a bibliography of the sources used to produce the entry. I cannot
     profess any particular interest in American geography, nor had I ever read any
     of the books in the series Fitzgerald describes, but her treatment of the subject,
     both thoroughgoing and humane, made it engrossing for this student of
     publishing history.
      ‘What was a novel in the late 18th and early r9th centuries? ... Who wrote
     them? Who published and sold them? How expensive were they? What was
     their appeal and popularity? How were they reviewed?’** The English Novel
    1770-1829: A Bibliographical Survey begins with this series of questions; all
     the answers are found in the bibliography. This remarkable work of scholar-
     ship convincingly demonstrates just how productive bibliographical inquiry
     can be for literary and book history. The introductory essays for each volume,
    by James Raven and Peter Garside respectively, together comprise some 200
     pages of analysis concerning such matters as the publication of Gothic novels,
     the most productive authors of novels, the authorship of new novels by
     gender, the place of publication of new novels, Dublin reprints, the principal
     publishers of novels by decade, the volume structure of novels, the publica-
     tion of epistolary fiction, the place and frequency of publication of further
     editions of novels and so on. In these pages, then, we find bibliographical
     information turned into book-historical knowledge.
     The ‘bibliographical survey’ of Garside, Raven and Schowerling, when
     subjected to rigorous analysis, yields insights into the history of authorship,
     publishing and reading that would be otherwise unobtainable. Although
     these volumes do not claim to belong to the category of descriptive biblio-
     graphy, as they neither provide collation formulas nor attempt to describe
     ideal copies of particular editions and distinguish them from various issues

  bibliographical facts about the publication of 3,677 works of fiction pro-
  duced over the course of sixty years, we would simply have no basis for the
  many important book-historical understandings that we find in the editors’
  introductions. No wonder, then, that these volumes provide a more compre-
  hensive and accurate description and analysis of fiction publishing in England
  in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries than any other study.
        Four bibliographical concepts every book historian
               will profit from knowing
  Just as physicians need to know anatomy and chemistry in order to practise
  their craft, so too do book historians benefit from understanding bibliogra-
  phy, even when their work is not strictly bibliographical. Four key concepts
  will help such historians get the most out of the descriptive bibliographies
  they consult. First, the term ‘edition’ denotes all the printings made at any
  time from a single setting of type, whether from standing type or from plates
  (stereotype, electrotype, etc.) made from that type. Thus, the key to under-
  standing the concept of edition is type; no matter how far separated in the
  time of their production, two books printed from substantially the same type
  belong to the same edition.
  How then to distinguish books printed at different times from the same
  type? ‘Impression’ denotes all the copies of a book (or other printed artefact,
  such as a broadside) printed from the same setting of type (that is, the same
  edition) at a given time. Thus, an impression is a subset of an edition. A later
  printing from the same type is not a new edition, but is a new impression.
  Thus, the key to understanding the concept of impression is time. When
  printing is done from stereotype plates, what are often casually called new
  editions are, bibliographically speaking, new impressions of the same edition,
  because the type is substantially the same. Because one setting of type (i.e. one
  edition) can be the parent of multiple impressions, it is sometimes difficult to
  distinguish one impression from another, especially for books printed from
  plates. Nonetheless, the identification of different impressions is often highly
  useful in understanding the production history of a work.
  How ought we to classify the books produced when the printer uses the
  same setting of type, producing a number of copies on ordinary paper and a
  smaller number on large paper to sell at a higher price? These books all belong
  to the same edition and the same impression, but they are not the same.
  Similarly, how are we to deal with the case of a printer producing a very
  large press run from plates and then over time selling them with title pages

      to the same edition and constitute a single impression, but they also differ in
     ways that it would be useful for the book historian to recognize and docu-
     ment. When a work printed at one time from the same setting of type (that is,
     the same impression) appears for sale in two or more forms intended to
     distinguish them as units of sale, we classify those varying forms as different
      issues. In the case of the ‘Colonial Edition’, for example, we might say that a
     number of sheets from the impression were ‘separately issued’ for sale in
     India. The key to understanding the concept of ‘issue’, then, is unit of sale. In
     much the same vein, imagine a bookseller who publishes a novel, but after
     some years has only sold half of his print run. He tries to reinvigorate sales by
     tearing off the old title pages and substituting instead a new title leaf, perhaps
     with a more sensational title, certainly with a new publication date, and with
     the false claim that this book is the ‘Second Edition, enlarged’. The book is
     now properly described as a ‘re-issue’.
       Finally, there is a fourth category, ‘state’, used to describe variants within
     an edition not intended to create a distinctive unit of sale. Such changes
     typically include corrections or alterations made during printing (e.g. stop-
     press correction; resetting a forme, wholly or partially because of an accident
     during printing), or after the first copies have been sold (e.g. the insertion of
     an errata slip or of advertisements; the addition or deletion of matter from
     the preliminaries, such as a dedication). The key to understanding the
     concept of ‘state’, then, is variation, which the publisher does not intend to
      call to the attention of the consumer. More generally, ‘state’ is typically used
      to recognize differences between or among copies when those differences are
     insufficiently consequential to suggest that the copies belong to different
     editions or issues.*?

     Jon Gilbert’s lan Fleming. The Bibliography (2012) provides a good example
     of how bibliography can inform and enliven the scholarship of the book
     historian, and the cultural historian as well. Gilbert’s book is packed with
     information and insights about the history of the James Bond novels through-
     out the process of their production: typescripts, uncorrected and corrected
     proofs, publication in hard covers (often in multiple impressions), paperback
     editions and later editions and impressions as well. Fleming, an accomplished
     book collector, publisher and noteworthy patron of book-historical scholar-
     ship, well understood the historical value of such materials, and he seems to
     have saved them whenever possible. As thoroughly as the ample surviving

  publisher’s editorial process and subsequent book production. Here too is a
  careful chronicle of Fleming’s non-fiction writings, his short stories and his
  well-known children’s novel, the posthumously published Chitty Chitty Bang
  Bang (3 vols., 1964, 1965).
   Gilbert’s bibliography reproduces all the principal book jackets, with
  illuminating discussions about Fleming’s close engagement with their produc-
  tion. This study also sheds light on the reception history of the Bond novels,
  supplying information about print runs in Britain and the US. (Sadly,
  Gilbert’s bibliography does not include translations.) We learn, for example,
  that Fleming’s inaugural volume, Casino Royale (1953), had an initial pro-
  duction of fewer than 4,750 copies, whereas You Only Live Twice (1964)
  was first produced in more than 80,000. Book historians poring over
  Gilbert’s bibliographical account will readily recognize the central impor-
  tance of book club editions in the mass consumption of Fleming’s fiction.
  There is still a great deal of work to be done by some enterprising book
  historian, however, on the relationships among the appearances of Bond films
  and the distribution and sales of the novels, as these are essential connections
  for understanding the Bond phenomenon. Similarly, the failure of Gilbert’s
  bibliography to document the Bond novels as a global brand cries out for
  redress. Though neither as ambitious nor as demanding a work of scholarship
  as, say, Fleeman’s Samuel Johnson or David Supino’s Henry James (see
  below), Ian Fleming. The Bibliography is well worth studying for what it
  can teach us about the Anglo-American publishing of popular fiction in the
  19508 and 1960s.
   One of the most creative and engaging bibliographies I have had the
  pleasure of reading is Tom Stoppard: A Bibliographical History, which
  chronicles the multifaceted career of a truly great contemporary dramatist,
  perhaps best known to popular audiences as the coauthor (with Marc
 Norman) of the screenplay for Shakespeare in Love. This fascinating scho-
  larly work is the product of close collaboration between William Baker, a
  professor recognized for his bibliography of Harold Pinter (2005), and
  Gerald Wachs, who is almost certainly the world’s foremost private collector
  of Stoppard materials. Their study is by no means a mere catalogue of an
  individual’s collection, however; the British National Sound Archive and the
  Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin are among the
  other principal repositories of the Stoppard materials delineated in this
  remarkable bibliography.
   Seeking to document Stoppard’s entire creative output as it survives, not
  only in print, but also on stage and screen, Baker and Wachs’s ‘bibliographi-

     Stoppard’s productions. There are fourteen in all, including: Plays and
     Sketches for the Stage, Radio and Television; Screenplays; Adaptations and
     Translations for the Stage; Fiction; Published Letters to Newspapers,
     Magazines, etc.; Editions of Collected or Selected Works; Articles; Radio
     and Television Interviews and Broadcasts; and so on. The most revealing
     aspects of this bibliography are found in the sensitive ways that the ‘format-
     ting and description conventions employed differ for each section as appro-
     priate to the gerieric areas and modes of publication’.‘* It is in this respect
     above all others that the authors of Tom Stoppard prove themselves most
     bibliographically adroit.
      Baker and Wachs stretch the limits of conventional bibliography to excel-
      lent effect, very appropriately expanding its mission to include multiple kinds
      of recorded texts, just as D. F. McKenzie envisioned in his Panizzi lectures,
     Bibliography and the Sociology of Texts (1986). We should remark, how-
      ever, that the system of generic organization employed by Baker and Wachs
     frequently requires that the reader seeking all the citations for a given work
      will have to search across more than one genre. Stoppard’s early stage play
     Jumpers (1972) is thus found not only under Plays and Sketches, but also
     under Editions of Collected Works, and is further referenced in multiple
     categories such as Published Letters to Newspapers, Magazines, etc.;
     Interviews Collected in Books; and Radio and Television Interviews and
     Broadcasts.
      The entries in this descriptive bibliography are extraordinarily extensive
     and as highly detailed as any book historian might wish, including, for
     example, information about a particular edition’s (or impression’s, or issue’s)
     binding, retail price, press run and how much the author made from its
     publication. Copy-specific annotations are also given for books consulted.
     Where relevant, we learn about the locations of any related documents, such
      as drafts and typescripts, as well as about the first dramatic production of any
     given work. Also helpful in this regard is the accompanying CD-ROM,
     containing eighty-nine images chiefly of book covers and dust jackets. This
     book, a comprehensive bibliographical catalogue of the creative output of a
     living person, successfully traces the cultural imprint of one of the most
     important dramatists in the English-speaking world. Yet, the significance of
      this ‘bibliographical history’ goes far beyond documenting Stoppard’s cul-
      tural impact, because it pushes the bounds of descriptive bibliography into
     sound recordings, videos and other electronic media. By powerful example,
     Baker and Wachs teach their readers how the institutional stewardship of
     contemporary culture, private collections and the rigor of bibliographical

   Raymond Chandler: A Descriptive Bibliography (1979) by Matthew
  Bruccoli, one of the finest textual and literary scholars of American modern-
  ism, highlights the impact that such scholarly works can have on the world of
  books. Bruccoli’s bibliography both reflected and contributed to an impor-
  tant book-historical phenomenon: the growing marketplace in the late 1960s
  and 1970s for collecting popular American literature and culture. Bruccoli’s
  volume was not only a response to this burgeoning interest; it also promoted a
  growing vogue for editions of Chandler, Dashiel Hammett and other authors
  of detective fiction. As almost any book dealer will attest: the existence of a
  descriptive bibliography fosters collecting by institutions and, especially,
  individuals.
   This bibliography by a scholar of Bruccoli’s great reputation also had a
  pronounced legitimating effect on the writings of Chandler, a mass-market
  author who was until then little regarded by the academy, and on the work of
  his close colleagues as well. Bruccoli’s book makes extensive use of photo-
  graphs to document his bibliographical descriptions and analytic insights.
  (Dust jackets are reproduced, as are both rectos and versos of title pages for
  the first American and English editions of each of Chandler’s works.)
  Accordingly, Bruccoli’s volume might usefully serve as an instruction manual
  to help the historian of twentieth-century publishing understand descriptive
  bibliography as an investigative practice that can yield historical insights
  unobtainable by other forms of scholarly research.
             What about illustrations?
  There is still much work to be done on the bibliography of illustrated books,
  a highly promising area for scholars wishing to undertake genuinely excit-
  ing new research that could have a great impact on our understanding of
  artists and author-artist collaborations, of publishing and marketing and of
  reading and reception. Ruth Mortimer’s bibliographies of sixteenth-century
  French and Italian illustrated books do much to point the way forward. The
  aim of these volumes is neither to enumerate and characterize all the surviving
  works by a single author, nor to establish the known output of any given press,
  artist or publishing house. Rather, Mortimer’s catalogues describe two parti-
  cular collections of books in [a ] [single ] [department ] [of ] [the ] [Harvard ] [College ]

     bibliographies constitute a noteworthy achievement in the history of descriptive
     bibliography.
      Because bibliographical scholarship has been primarily concerned with the
      uses of bibliographical analysis in service of scholarly editing — and because
      intaglio illustrations (viz., engravings and etchings) are not produced along-
      side letterpress text on a common press (as are the relief illustrations made by
     woodcuts and wood engravings), but instead are made separately on a rolling
      press and subsequently added to the letterpress sheets — descriptive biblio-
     graphies have been consistently poor in describing illustrations with sufficient
      care. Reading Mortimer’s bibliographies, however, one comes away with a
     compelling history of sixteenth-century book illustration and of visual culture
     more generally. Although the reader wishing to construct a coherent narrative
     must do so from the alphabetically presented, individual entries, the chrono-
      logical listing at the end of each catalogue makes such a task surprisingly
      tractable. All book historians will readily perceive that illustration is an index
      of reception and that it can have a marked effect on book production, price
     (both wholesale and retail), reputation and reader response. The entries
      in Mortimer’s descriptive bibliographies are marvellous opportunities for
     immersing oneself in the particularities of such matters.
      The one predecessor of Mortimer who must be mentioned is Allan
     Stevenson, who produced the second volume of the catalogue of the Hunt
     Botanical Collection in Pittsburgh. Stevenson’s groundbreaking essay in that
     volume, ‘A Bibliographical Method for the Description of Botanical Books’,
      as well as his actual practice, set a standard for bibliographical description of
      illustrations with a scholarly thoroughness and accessibility that, to my
     knowledge, had never been achieved before — and perhaps has never been
     equalled since.*® Every book historian interested in the history of illustration
     could learn a great deal from reading Stevenson’s scholarship, which deserves
      to be far better known outside the world of botanical bibliography and
      collecting.
           A digression on degression, or what’s the matter?
     Most descriptive bibliographies make use of ‘the degressive principle’, a
     common system for succinctly deploying bibliographical information based
     on a hierarchy of entries. At its best, degressive bibliography works like this:
     once the earliest books appropriately classed under a particular heading (e.g.
     those belonging to the same edition, whether subsequent impressions, varying
      issues or textually significant states) have been fully described, later entries
     categorized under the same ‘family’ do not repeat information that has

```

-----

```
                        in full. Degressive bibliographies
  are most often characterized by a numbering system that enables the reader
  easily to understand the publication history of a text and to locate individual
  instances of that text. In the Baker and Wachs bibliography of Tom Stoppard,
  for example, ‘A’ signifies the general category ‘plays, and sketches for the
  stage, radio and television’. A23 is the heading for Stoppard’s play Arcadia,
  so A23< is the first edition (Faber and Faber 1993); A23b the ‘revised edition
  with corrections’; A23¢ the ‘Fireside edition’; A23d the first American edition,
  and so on.
   Such a system is bibliographically trustworthy, however, if and only if all
  ‘descendant works’ are examined with the same degree of thoroughness as the
  parent work. Otherwise, potentially significant differences will be over-
  looked, thus compromising the intellectual value of the bibliographical pro-
  ject and its book-historical reliability and use. Responsibly practised, the
  degressive display of bibliographical information saves space and, hence,
  makes printed bibliographies more affordable. Ideally, delineating how a
  given volume is dissimilar from earlier publications brings new, identifying
  features into sharp relief and helps the reader more readily understand
 what changes have occurred that make a given printing distinctive and
  distinguishable. *7
  When later editions are comprehensively included and fully described, then
  the practical exigencies that conduce toward characterizing variant issues and
  states — and subsequent impressions too — in lesser detail for the sake of
 economy are understandable, even if they perhaps inevitably have some
  regrettable consequences. (Sometimes, for example, it becomes difficult to
  piece together the full complement of bibliographical information the reader
  requires.)'® When, however, later editions are given short shrift — through
  more cursory description, or, as is too commonly the case, omission — then the
  degressive principle in practice becomes the enemy of the comprehensiveness
  that is of central value to bibliographical scholarship.
   For all its practical viability - particularly when enumerating multiple
  iterations of works produced in the machine-press period — the principle of
  degression all too frequently results in a practice that is at odds with the
  central tenets of many leading book historians. Roger Chartier, Jerome
 McGann and D. F. McKenzie all emphasize that every iteration of a work
  in its published texts is important because it instantiates an historically valu-
  able theory of that work, its author and its most likely market (or reading
  public). Yet, as a central organizing [principle ] [of ] [most ] [bibliographies ] [pub- ]
  lished since the second half of the twentieth century, degression typically (but
              although [the ] [bibliographical ] [details ] [provided ] [for ]

-----

```
     information is included for subsequent printings. The result, whether
      intended or not, is that later iterations of a work seem to be less important.
     The Oxford scholar Falconer Madan, who first adumbrated the degressive
      principle in 1903 and committed it to print in 1906, certainly believed that the
      oldest printings were far and away of greatest interest, and that the biblio-
      graphical and historical significance of texts declined in proportion to their
      distance in time from the first edition. The American textual editor Fredson
     Bowers also shared this belief.*?
      The idea that earlier instances of publication are more bibliographically
      valuable and more culturally revelatory than later publications may be gen-
      erally attributable to the esteem we accord to what is old, but it is also a
     consequence of two particular cultural practices that may be of limited
      usefulness for understanding the life of a work as it circulates over time.
     The first of these is the conduct of the commercial market in antiquarian
      books, which typically prizes first editions far above subsequent printings of a
      text. Generally speaking, in the antiquarian market and the world of bib-
      liophily and collecting, the higher the edition number, the lower the book’s
     monetary value. Thus, in the absence of copies with special bindings or
      especially significant provenances (‘association copies’), the second edition
      almost invariably fetches a higher price than the fourth; the fourth is
     accounted of greater worth than the seventh, and the seventh greater than
      the tenth. Hence, the degressive principle as it is commonly practised — while
      perfectly suited for antiquarian book dealers and the collectors of early
      editions who need to learn about bibliographical ‘points’ in order to identify
     and ascertain the value of their early editions — may be less congenial to the
     book historian who seeks to understand the life of a given work over its whole
      history of publication and reception.
      The second cultural practice that has conditioned the hierarchies of infor-
     mation contained in bibliographies — particularly the degressive principle — is
      the use of bibliographical studies in service of textual criticism. We should not
      forget that, even in the twenty-first century, many bibliographical protocols,
      intellectual attitudes and habits of mind have their origins in a (now outdated)
     conception of bibliography as primarily the servant of scholarly editing and
      textual criticism which, in turn, was perceived to be the servant of literary
      studies. It is fair to say that the foundations of bibliography as practised
     throughout most of the twentieth century (the ‘New Bibliography’ of W. W.
      Greg, A. W. Pollard, R. B. McKerrow and their successors) were rooted in
      attempts to establish the ‘true’ text of the plays of Shakespeare and his
     contemporaries and, hence, became inextricably linked with the vexing
      business of describing and analysing Elizabethan and early-Jacobean play

                       publication) are generally consid-
  ered of lesser value for scholarly editors. In contrast, for the book historian
  later instantiations of a work are also of considerable importance because
  they can reveal a great deal about the life-history of the work.
       A fifth (and final) bibliographical concept: format
  Descriptive bibliographies can be of great help to book historians for tracking
  changes in a work’s format over time. Few technical terms used by biblio-
  graphers are more easily misunderstood by non-specialists than ‘format’.”°
  Most people quite reasonably think of ‘format’ as meaning ‘layout’, or textual
  presentation (sometimes called ‘mise-en-page’), especially because ‘format’ in
  this sense is one of the headings for the pull-down menus in Microsoft®
  Word. There is also a second, bookish sense for format: the term is often
  predicated generically to describe a book’s size and shape — think of the ‘large
  format’ shelves in our libraries. Yet, in descriptive bibliographies (and in
  bibliographical writing more generally) ‘format’ most often refers to one of
  four kinds of book form: folio (Fo, or 2°, where the printed sheet is folded
  once to form two leaves), quarto (4to, or 4°, folded twice for four leaves),
  octavo (8vo, or 8°, folded three times giving eight leaves) and duodecimo
  (12mo, or 12°, folded to form a gathering of twelve leaves). Less frequently,
  the reader might also encounter three other formats: sixteenmo (16mo, 16°,
  sometimes called sextodecimo), twentyfourmo (z4mo, 24°, sometimes called
  vicesimo-quarto) and thirtytwomo (32mo, 32°, sometimes called tricesimo-
  secundo). Generally speaking, most works go down format —- say, from
  quarto to octavo to duodecimo — as they are reprinted over time.
   A book’s format is a useful index of its intended audience, use and, often,
  price. Format, a central dimension of a book’s expressive form, signals some-
  thing of its contents and hospitability to its readers. In his diary for January
  1790, James Boswell recorded a conversation with Edmond Malone in which
  Boswell revealed his ambition to publish The Life of Johnson in folio.
  Malone, who was attuned to the ways of the London trade and the predilec-
  tions of contemporary readers, explained that his friend ‘might as well throw
  it into the Thames’ because ‘a folio would not now be read’.*" Writing to her
  sister, Jane Austen remarked with mock scornfulness on ‘those enormous
  great stupid thick quarto volumes’, further confiding, ‘I detest a Quarto’. She
  castigated those who would ‘not understand a man who condenses his
  thoughts into an octavo’, a format that betokened greater accessibility, port-
  ability (and, hence, sociability), authorial restraint and unpretentiousness.
  Her jocular observations, made in 1813, reflect a shift in sensibility more than

       In the era before the widespread use of steam-driven machine presses
     and machine-made paper (also called ‘wove paper’) for book making
      (c. 1455—-c. 1830 and beyond), a book’s format is usually defined by the
     number of times the original printed sheet of paper, hand-made at the vat
      (called ‘laid paper’) has been folded to create its component leaves. When a
     sheet is folded once to make a folio, consisting of two leaves, the chain lines
      are vertical, the vergures (thin parallel lines, alternating light and dark) are
     horizontal, and the watermark generally falls in the centre of the leaf. When
     the sheet is folded twice to make a quarto, consisting of four leaves, the chain
      lines are horizontal, the vergures vertical, and the watermark shifts into the
     centre of the inner margin. When the sheet is folded three times to make an
     octavo, consisting of eight leaves, the chain lines return to vertical, the
     vergures to horizontal and the watermark migrates to the top, inner corner.
      Despite the convention of defining format by the way the sheet is folded, it
      is more accurate to define it as the way that pages of type are imposed in the
     forme for printing; how the sheet is folded after printing is a consequence of
     imposition. (Two matching formes — called the ‘inner forme’ and the ‘outer
     forme’ — were made for each sheet; the typeset pages were arranged according
      to established patterns to create the correct sequence of pages when the sheet,
     having been printed on both sides, was folded.) Format, then, is best thought
     of as a classification of a book’s structure as a consequence of its production.
      With the growing use in the nineteenth century of machine-made paper, in
     which sheets were cut from a continuous roll, formats become more difficult
      to identify. Because the iron hand press (e.g. the Stanhope, Albion and
     Columbian) remained in widespread use for book work throughout much
     of the century, however, the concept of format remains useful for classifying
     the pattern of typographical imposition used to make a book. When books
      are made on machine presses from machine-made paper, however, ‘format’ is
     typically associated with leaf dimensions, or with book-trade descriptions,
     and thus is more an expression of a book’s size and shape, rather than a
     classification of the volume’s structure resulting from its method of
     production.

  and sold his writings. Supino’s exemplary work is a model of integrative
  scholarly method, powerfully combining close bibliographical scrutiny of
  particular textual artefacts with the archival recovery of book-historical
  information in as much detail as the surviving documents allow.
   Using the Houghton Mifflin Archive, for example, Supino chronicles the
  US printing history of The American in its original stereotype edition, provid-
  ing the production dates, press-runs and binding times for the twenty-seven
  impressions made from 1887 to 1919. He also registers evidence that copies
  of an early impression of this edition were imported into England (and sold
  for ros 6d). The bibliography further provides details of an undated English
  ‘piracy’ and gives reasons for establishing the likelihood that it preceded the
  yellowback unauthorized edition, also undated, printed from the same plates.
   Crucially, Supino is always testing his sources against one another, as when
  he discovers, for example, a divergence between the documentary evidence in
  the Houghton Mifflin Archive about the binding of the first two impressions
  of The American and the evidence produced by scrutinizing the actual pub-
  lications in their several forms (4.4.0). With characteristic restraint, Supino
  posits a likely explanation for this conflict, but then is quick to point out that
  the available evidence neither confirms nor disproves the account he pro-
  poses. Reading further in the same entry, we learn that the Houghton Mifflin
  ‘trade editions’ of The American (1922ff), marketed as part of its Riverside
  Literature Series (‘Riverside College Classics’), were made from a duplicate
  set of plates of the New York Edition (which was owned by the James estate
  and Scribner’s). These and other comparable editions and issues of his novels
  from the extensively revised New York Edition did more to establish James’s
  posthumous reputation in America than anything else.
   Supino’s transatlantic scholarship enables us to compare the reception of
  Daisy Miller (1879 [1878]) in the US and UK. The first American edition was
  published as part of Harper’s Half-Hour Series and priced at $.35 in cloth and
  $.20 in wrappers; in only a few weeks 20,000 copies were sold. The story of
  the first English edition is just the opposite. Sold in two volumes and priced at
  218, it sold just 285 copies in its first nine months on the market. Tellingly, the
  American editions quickly became progressively more expensive: the second
  American edition (issued as part of the Franklin Square Library) cost $.75; the
  third (1892ff) was priced at $3.50 for the trade issue and $15.00 for the
  deluxe (limited to 250 copies). Featuring 1071 illustrations, expensive paper, a
  richly decorated binding and an accompanying box, both issues were
  obviously marketed as a gift book.
   Antiquarian booksellers and collectors of modern first editions have long
  accepted the notion that the first impression of the first edition of The Portrait

     immediately following the copyright statement on the title-page verso. The
     market value of early impressions of the Portrait has depended on this key to
     identifying the novel’s earliest printing, and there are large sums of money and
     much cultural prestige at stake based on its truth. Yet, Supino’s careful study
     of the first seven impressions has enabled him to establish definitively that this
     bibliographical shibboleth is a false custom — and to produce a reliable test for
     making a true identification. Now, libraries and private collectors who paid
     handsomely for what they ‘knew’ to be a first impression are discovering that
     what they have is actually something else of rather less monetary value than
      they had imagined. Others, presumably holding a later impression, are find-
     ing themselves pleasantly surprised. ‘Expert’ antiquarian booksellers and
      scholars have learned yet again that there is no substitute for sustained
     engagement with the printed artefacts themselves and immersive attention
      to a bibliographical or book-historical problem.
       It is the artful combining of evidence from publishers’ archives — e.g.
     from Macmillan (British Library), Charles Scribner’s (Firestone Library,
     Princeton), Harper and Brothers (Butler Library, Columbia) and Houghton
      Mifflin (Houghton Library, Harvard), from private papers and correspon-
      dence and from the meticulous examination of the books themselves, that
     makes Supino’s bibliography such a wide-ranging and reliable resource.
      The pages of Henry James: A Bibliographical Catalogue are rich with ore
      that book historians can and should profitably mine. A good case in point is
      the index delineating the publication history of each of James’s stories and
      tales, recording the first magazine publication and all subsequent book pub-
      lications of those narratives from 1875 to 1923. This conspectus of James’s
      career as a writer of short stories and novellas, some roo in all, appearing in
     twenty-seven different newspapers and serials (not including piracies) is
     highly revealing and could easily serve as the foundation for an important
     book-historical scholarly publication. I feel morally obligated to warn young
     and old alike that Supino’s elegant bibliography is highly addictive; as a great
      artist’s career unfolds, the details are fascinating in themselves, even as they
      beautifully coalesce to establish a narrative that adds up to far more than the
     sum of its parts.
       Supino’s study is a fitting place at which to conclude this discussion,
     because it amply demonstrates what bibliography can do for book history —
     and what book history can, in turn, accomplish for bibliography. Generally
     speaking, bibliographical studies benefit from the social reach of book his-
      tory, even as book-historical research becomes stronger when it incorporates
      insights from bibliography’s attention to textual artefacts, which in the best
      descriptive bibliographies is both close and comprehensive. These related

       KATHERINE BODE AND ROGER OSBORNE
  Book history from the archival record
  The OED defines the archive simply as ‘A place in which public records or
  other important historic documents are kept’. Whether in a library or
  museum, an online database or a dusty box in an attic, archives are the
  basis for all humanities scholarship. In book history, they hold a particularly
  special place, because scholars in this field are concerned with not only what is
  ostensibly recorded in the archive, but the material evidence of print culture
  that archives contain. Quite simply, archival research provides the principal
  way for book historians to explore and understand the history and nature of
  authorship, publication, distribution and reception of print culture. Since the
  early twenty-first century, there has been significant growth in interest in
  the concept of the archive, in the context of, and arguably motivated by, the
  processes and implications of digitizing our cultural heritage. This extensive
  body of critical scholarship spans a range of fields, including literary studies,
  history, philosophy, sociology, anthropology and political science. Much of
  this research builds upon important analyses of the archive by philosopher
  Jacques Derrida and historian Michel Foucault. These scholars’ conceptions
  of the archive are complex and challenging, but broadly speaking, both
  emphasize its contingent nature — the way in which an institution tends to
  respond to changing values — and its relationship to history and memory, as
  well as to social, political and technological power.
   We accept the broad argument of recent critical scholarship on the archive:
  that these are not passive and innocent collections of documents and reflec-
  tions of our collective past. Scholars now regard archival collections as
  representations of history, as cultural texts in their own right. The meaning
  of any given archive is constructed at several levels — first by the values held by
  the men and women who originally created the records it preserves, and
  later by those of subsequent owners and of the archivists whose task it is to
  order and preserve the records. Archives perforce change with shifting cul-
  tural values. However, we do not survey these arguments in detail.’ Our focus

         — its
     reading the archive in book history: first, analysing individual documents
     within the archive (a qualitative approach); second, using what the archive
     contains as the basis for bibliometric studies (a quantitative approach). More
     briefly, we consider the emergence of new, digital archives, and the opportu-
     nities and challenges these present for book history. For each approach to the
     archive — qualitative and quantitative — and for material as well as digital
     collections, we consider, in turn, the main sources for book history and
     highlight some of the scholarship that makes the best use of those sources,
     as well as discussing the practical and methodological issues raised by archi-
     val research.
             Reading the qualitative archive: sources
     Archives contain books but, as D. F. McKenzie reminds us, ‘no book was ever
    bound by its covers’.* The many other archival records associated with print
     culture — of authors, publishers, printers, booksellers, policy-makers and
     readers — are part of the ‘bound’-less history of the book. Having served
     their original purposes, these records can be put to use again in the hands of
    book historians, as vital sources of information about the history and opera-
     tions of print culture. The three main categories of archival records most used
     in book history are correspondence, publishers’ records and booksellers’ and
     library records.
     Correspondence from and to people involved in the production and recep-
     tion of books provides some of the most direct evidence of relationships
     between individuals in print culture and of the broader operations of the
    communications circuit. An author’s correspondence might include letters to
     friends, literary agents, publishers and readers, and provide insight into the
    way a book was written, edited, printed, distributed and read. The corre-
    spondence collected in the archive of a literary agent might provide access to
     direct communications with an author, or opinions about the work that the
     author was not privy to. Further removed from the author, the correspon-
     dence of a library or bookseller might provide specific reasons why a book
     was or was not purchased for a particular group of readers. Scholars can be
     greatly assisted by editions of an author’s correspondence, bringing together
     material from archives across the world. Despite their value, such collections
     are often one-sided, so a trip to the archive — or consultation of related, but
     tangential correspondence between other people — can be necessary to fill in
     the other side of the correspondence.
      Scholarly editions, particularly those that are accompanied by editorial

```

```
  editions of Joseph Conrad and D. H. Lawrence — provide some of the best
  examples of how correspondence is used in archival research. The temporal
  specificity of correspondence has been of particular value to scholarly editors,
 who use such sources to track the composition, publication, distribution and
  reception of books. Correspondence can draw attention to the involvement of
  a range of actors in print culture, including scribes, printers, publishers,
  booksellers and readers. In this respect, the use of correspondence provides
  a good example of the ways in which authority is attributed to items within
  the archive. In cases where the primary objective of a scholarly edition is to
  capture the author’s final intentions, the authority of readers’ and book-
  sellers’ correspondence about the work is attributed little value. However,
  the value of such correspondence increases in editions that aim to represent
  the work as it was delivered to specific audiences. Scholarly editions also
  provide some of the best examples of the ways in which previously undiscov-
  ered correspondence can destabilize established arguments by directing atten-
  tion to new information. The Mark Twain Project, for instance, identifies this
  potential of correspondence as one of the main reasons it delivers online
  versions of Twain’s works that are amenable to revision.
   In addition to correspondence with authors, publishers’ archives contain
 numerous records relating to all aspects of book production and distribution.
  These records can include evidence of the calculation of pre-publication costs,
  content acquisition, editing, design and illustration, preparation and manu-
  facturing, marketing and selling, post-publication costs, author royalties,
  distribution and general and administrative costs. With such a multitude of
  variables to include in the decisions about whether or not to accept an
  author’s manuscript, some have likened the business of books to gambling.’
 The participants in this gamble include author and publisher, but in a busy
  publishing house, this activity will also include editors, outside readers, sales-
  people, accountants, printers and others, all of whom may leave records of
  their involvement. The production files, readers’ reports, estimates, contracts,
  sales reports and statements all provide evidence of how books were trans-
 formed from authors’ manuscripts to printed form. Publisher records are not
  only found in the business records of a company. Sometimes, the production
  of a book can be pieced together by consulting the records of an author or
  literary agent. Contracts, statements, rejection letters and other such records
 could be scattered across several collections, requiring the researcher to
 connect fragments, retained separately and under different circumstances.
   Instances of exemplary use of publishers’ records abound, but it is worth
 noting a few to show the range of evidence available in such archives.
 An early but notable example is Robert L. Patten’s Charles Dickens and His

     appendices — constructed from publishers’ archives — that detail the sales,
      profits, income and circulation of Dickens’s books, and the printing history of
      his monthly serials, including circulation figures. More recently, Ben Yagoda
     was able to offer a detailed account of the business and culture of The New
     Yorker because of the extensive records held at the New York Public Library.
      In About Town: The New Yorker and the World It Made (2000) Yagoda
     draws on eighty years’ of correspondence, manuscripts, readers’ reports,
     photographs, cartoons and other records related to the publishing activities
     of The New Yorker to describe the material and cultural conditions under
     which many of the most significant American writers saw their work deliv-
     ered to readers. Similarly, in A Feeling for Books: The Book-of-the-Month
     Club, Literary Taste, and Middle-class Desire (1997), Janice Radway draws
      on the personal archives, including oral history recordings, of judges of the
     American Book-of-the-Month Club to describe the culture of the book that
     evolved through the engagement of the judges with publishers and readers
      since the club’s establishment in 1926.
       Collections of bookseller or library records are rarer than authors’ or
     publishers’ archives, and those that do exist often supply only a fragment of
      the historical record that these institutions would have produced. Such
     records found in research on library usage in nineteenth-century America
     have been used, however, to demonstrate that male library patrons ‘com-
     modified their reading into categorizations like “useful knowledge” and
     “rational amusements”’, in order to adopt specific acts of reading in the
      definition of character.* Such civic activities occurred across the world, and
      so the minute books and annual reports of both small and large libraries often
      indicate the types of reading to be pursued under the watchful eye of commit-
      tees. The range of studies of library records suggests the rich sources of
     information potentially held in the archives of libraries around the world.
     The records of booksellers can be read in a similar way to library and
     publisher’s records. The bookseller frequently takes a gamble with the
     books stocked on the shelves and serves the community in a similar way to
      libraries by providing a meeting place for book talk and a collection of books
      that reflect the taste of the community served. As institutions, libraries and
     booksellers provided a space for communities to procure the books they used
      for entertainment or edification, leaving records that can be analysed to
     explore how individuals and cultural groups perceived their position in the
     community, nation and the world.
      Researchers have regularly drawn on the records of libraries and book-
      sellers to describe the readers and reading of particular times. The most
     notable of recent studies is William St Clair’s The Reading Nation in the

  lenders. This research contributes significantly to the development of quanti-
  tative methods, as discussed in the second part of this chapter, but this occurs
  in conjunction with consistent reference to the evidence of individual and
  collective reading found in correspondence, journals and other commentaries
 housed in the archives of book clubs, authors and libraries. James Raven
 draws on a similar number of archives in The Business of Books: Booksellers
 and the English Book Trade, 1450-1850 (2007), demonstrating how book-
  sellers were central to the evolution of books from a luxury to a commodity.
 Using archives rich in documents relating to the everyday lives of African-
 Americans, Elizabeth McHenry expanded the conception of nineteenth-
  century literary societies in Forgotten Readers: Recovering the Lost History
 of African American Literary Societies (2002). Such studies as these draw
  attention to the content of archives by compiling rich and compelling narra-
  tives that make the archives ‘talk’.>
       Reading the qualitative archive: issues and methods
 While serendipitous discovery on-site can be thrilling, advance planning
 when visiting an archive will enable more effective use of the researcher’s
  time. The contents of archives can be considered from afar through a range of
 printed and online guides, providing opportunities to prioritize visits accord-
 ing to the descriptions provided. The website of the Society for the History of
 Authorship, Publishing and Reading (SHARP) is a good source of informa-
  tion about the location of publishers’ and printers’ archives and other
 resources. Such guides often identify institutions or individuals that can
 provide more detailed finding aids, in some cases down to the collection
  level. This sort of information is useful to novice and experienced researchers
  alike, and can provide invaluable assistance to those who have to travel great
 distances to conduct their research. No two archives are the same, but all have
 protocols that dictate entry and use, including in some cases the need for
  official introductions or permission to visit. Seasoned researchers will always
 advise novices to make contact ahead of time and become familiar with the
 archive’s policies. This applies particularly to retrieval times. Some archives
 store material off-site and may take more than twenty-four hours to
 deliver requested material. Ordering such material ahead of time will save
 time and money.
   It is a good idea to communicate with the archivist in advance of a visit.

     productivity of your visit, providing links and clues that are not evident in the
     guides or published material. The archivist will also be an important guide to
      the provenance of the records, enabling the researcher to better understand
      the original accession, the collection policies that preserved the records
     and the effect of these on any collection’s ability to represent the past.
       In addition to these practical considerations, a range of methodological
      issues are important when accessing and interpreting the archival record.
     These issues highlight how the researcher does not simply read history off
      the archive, but takes account of the construction and nature of each collec-
      tion. Perhaps the most important issue to bear in mind is that, whether it
      relates to an individual, business, institution or state, no archival record is
      either complete or fully revealing. Rather, there are various levels of construc-
      tion and mediation of the archive. Most records have already undergone a
      process of ‘archiving’. Individuals make decisions about what documents
     they want to keep or discard. For instance, Vance and Nettie Palmer (two
     prominent twentieth-century Australian authors) destroyed their business
      records — presumably believing them not worthy of preservation — removing
     from their personal papers information regarding earnings, contractual
     arrangements and other financial dealings. This same principle, on a larger
      scale, applies to an institution’s records. For instance, the Doubleday Records
      at the Library of Congress are heavily weighted to the valuation of the editor
     Ken McCormick, who selected and annotated groups of records that he
     thought were important or interesting.
       All archives are formed in relation to the methods, rules and spatial limita-
      tions of their managers, whether the archivist is professional or amateur. The
      creation, organization and storage of business or personal records influence
     decisions about which records to retain, and which to dispose of.
     Consequently, the records we find in the archive come with contexts that
      exhibit changing attitudes to value and historical knowledge. An impulse to
      collect the ‘best’ records or the most ‘memorable’ or ‘important’ is shared by
      the archivist and the author or business in question. The records that are
      retained or donated might reflect a hagiographic impulse or the sentimental
      feelings of an individual. When records are donated and transferred to a
     formal archive — whether a library, museum, public record office or univer-
      sity — another process will further shape the archive through selection and
     disposal of records, according to the archivist’s methods of valuation. Finding
      aids may also reflect value judgments, for example by cataloguing folders
     containing the records of famous writers, but relegating more obscure
     authors to general folders filed alphabetically or otherwise.

   Archival records are not only incomplete and mediated by various levels of
  archival intervention; they are also subjective. The records of individuals and
  institutions are strongly influenced by the beliefs, perspectives, values, inter-
  ests and aims of those that produce them. For instance, in terms of corre-
  spondence records, authors have been known to provide competing accounts
  of an event to different correspondents, depending on the stake each recipient
  has in a book. All of these issues point to the careful sifting and interpretation
  required of archival research. James L. W. West III’s account of preparing a
  scholarly edition expresses these requirements well:
   The editor must examine the surviving notes, manuscripts, typescripts, proofs,
   and other evidence. The editor must also read the relevant letters and journals
   and study the publishers’ records and account books. From these materials an
   account of the composition of the work can be fashioned. The narrative will be
   assembled from the evidence that is otherwise inert. One does not ‘allow’ the
   archives to talk; one ‘makes’ them talk, crafting stories in the same way that
   biographers and historians do, by selecting and arranging the evidence and
   writing a story that ties the whole together.®
  In other words, reading the archive involves not only exploring a wide range
  of sources, but producing a narrative out of this sorting and sifting, one that
  further shapes — or manipulates — the contents of the archives used. As with
  the organization of the archive, the historical narrative is selective and sub-
  jective. When researchers enter the archive and sit down to receive the docu-
  ments they hope will inform their narratives, it is important to remember this
  selection and subjectivity in order to appreciate the complexity and contin-
  gency of the field.
         Reading the quantitative archive: sources
  The subject of book history is, as Simon Eliot writes, ‘rooted in the material
  world’; and while this material world incorporates elements that cannot be
  quantified — such as the tone of an editor’s correspondence with an author or
  an individual’s reading experience — it is also ‘characterized in part, and
  therefore is to be understood in part, by countable quantities: reams of
  paper, tons of type, print runs, and percentage returns on capital’.’” The
  three main categories of archival resources used in quantitative book history
  are the records of publishers and [allied ] [trades; ] [bibliographies ] [and ] [library ]
  catalogues; and information [created ] [by ][legislative ] [and ] [governing ] [bodies ] [in ]
 managing the book trade.
   The archives of individual publishers, booksellers and printers provide

      of lists: for instance, of print runs, wages, sales. Features of
      the archive can also be transformed into data for quantitative analysis. For
      instance, in Edging Women Out (1989), Gaye Tuchman and Nina Fortin
     analyse gender trends in Victorian novel publishing in part by sampling the
     number of novel manuscripts — by men and women - accepted and refused
     by London publisher, Macmillan. Where this and other studies — such as
     Darnton’s The Business of the Enlightenment (1987) — analyse quantitative
     information froma single publisher’s archives, other studies survey multiple
      archives. From the fifty publishing and printing archives he surveys for
     The Reading Nation in the Romantic Period (2004), St Clair draws data
      on prices, print runs, intellectual property and readership to explore the
     movement of, and access to, literature in the eighteenth and nineteenth
      centuries.
      The archives of organizations related to the book trade — including the
     many (usually national) associations, societies and guilds of publishers,
      authors, booksellers and libraries — also represent a key source of historical
      data, especially regarding members and business and legal processes. A
      particularly important archive of this type is that of the Stationers’
     Company, a guild of printers, typesetters, bookbinders and booksellers
      based in London and operating from the fifteenth to the twentieth century.
      This company supervised entry into the publishing trade, controlled working
      conditions and wages, set the retail price on books and regulated copyright.
       Its archives represent a unique and important source of quantitative informa-
      tion on British print culture. Other sources of bibliometric information aris-
      ing from the book trade include listings of publications and publication
      statistics in trade journals such as Publishers’ Weekly, Publishers’ Circular
      or The Bookseller; the catalogues of book fairs, including those of Frankfurt,
     London and New York; and sales data (while collected differently in different
      countries and regions, the global sales database, Nielsen BookScan is an
      increasingly prominent — though expensive to access — source of information
      on sales).
      The lists and descriptions of books compiled by bibliographers and librar-
      ians sit at the heart of quantitative book history. Union catalogues — which
      describe the collections in a number of libraries and include the Library
      of Congress Catalogue and the WorldCat Database published by Online
     Computer Library Center Inc. (OCLC) — provide valuable bibliographical
      information. So too do the many national and other bibliographies, which
     incorporate information about printed material ranging from the basic (titles,
      authors, publishers, dates and places of publication) to the detailed (specifics
      of printing, illustration, binding, size, price and editions). All this can be

 for such analysis: devised with reference to established standards and fields,
 the data have a high degree of consistency across the record. Significantly,
 these sources frequently collate many of the records of the book trade dis-
 cussed above, as well as multiple other sources (including previous bibliogra-
 phies). For instance, The English Novel 1770-1829: A Bibliographical
 Survey of Prose Fiction Published in the British Isles (2000) is compiled
 from ‘eighteenth- and nineteenth-century review notices, booksellers’ and
 printers’ records, advertisements and term catalogues, followed by extensive
 searches of ESTC [English Short-Title Catalogue], OCLC, and hands-on
 stack work in many hundreds of libraries worldwide’.®
  Quantitative analysis of library catalogues and borrowers’ records has
 contributed significantly to reading history. In A Measure of Popularity:
 Public Library Holdings of Twenty-Four Popular Authors, 1883-1912
 (1992), Eliot surveys over eighty library catalogues from England and
 Scotland to explore the relative popularity of authors such as Walter
 Besant, Charles Dickens and Margaret Oliphant. Jonathan Rose’s The
 Intellectual Life of the British Working Class (2001) incorporates quantita-
 tive analysis of library records and survey results — in addition to analysis of
 autobiographies and memoirs — to explore the autodidact tradition in Britain.
 In a different national context, Tim Dolin’s recent quantitative studies of the
 holdings and borrowings of subscription libraries have significantly
 expanded understandings of reading practices in Australia in the nineteenth
 and early twentieth centuries. Bibliographies likewise provide the source for
 quantitative research in a number of studies, underpinning, for instance,
 analyses of trends in national histories of the book for Britain, Canada and
 Australia.?
  A final, major archival source of information for quantitative archival
 research in book history comes from the records of legislative bodies man-
 aging and monitoring the various aspects of the book trade, including copy-
 right, taxes, trade and legislation. Alexis Weedon’s Victorian Publishing:
 The Economics of Book Production for a Mass Market, 1836-1916 (2003)
 incorporates data from a range of government records. For instance, she uses
 the Annual Statement of Trade published in Parliamentary Papers to explore
 the international expansion of the British publishing industry. In a pair of
 essays discussing the use of publishing statistics, Robert Darnton and Priya
 Joshi both employ quantitative information from the Indian Civil Service
 (ICS) archives. Joshi’s ‘Quantitative Method, Literary History’ focuses on
 the quarterly ‘catalogues’ registering and describing new publications in
 India, while Darnton’s ‘Book Production in British India, 1850-1900” uses
 the annual ‘reports’ quantifying and analysing book publication in each

      period, from the slow emergence of the novel in India to some surprising
      similarities in book production in India and England.*°
           Reading the quantitative archive: issues and methods
     Darnton’s and Joshi’s essays also provide a useful introduction to some
     common challenges in bibliometric research. The chief — indeed, overarch-
      ing — difficulty for such research is data quality. As with archival records
      generally, historical data is often ‘patchy ... much more has been lost than
      survives’."* However, this inevitable incompleteness — while obviously
      decreasing coverage and consistency — is not the only issue affecting the
      quality of historical data, as the case of the ICS archives shows. Although
     Darnton and Joshi work on ostensibly the same archive, as both acknowl-
      edge, their statistics and results differ significantly; as Joshi puts it, they are
      ‘mutually inconsistent ... incompatible in significant points of content and
      abstraction’.** Their justifications for the historical data they study high-
      light two further issues affecting data quality.
       The first arises from record keeping and reporting procedures. Darnton
      argues that the annual reports ‘cover data that were not included in the
      catalogues’, while Joshi describes reporting procedures for these same docu-
      ments as so lackadaisical as to render them ‘abstract at best, and at worst
      simply misleading’. Inconsistent record keeping and reporting procedures —
      which can create gaps, inconsistencies and errors in the historical record —
      affect even the most well-known and utilized resources in quantitative book
      history. For instance, although registration with the Stationers’ Company
      provided the normal means of securing copyright in Britain for much of the
      last five centuries, Michael Robertson estimates that only two-thirds of British
       titles are included in the company’s entry books. Likewise, Michael Suarez
      proposes that approximately ro per cent of titles and editions published in the
      eighteenth century no longer exist, and are thus not recorded in the English
      Short Title Catalogue for that period.” It is significant that, even for these
     major records, the quality and completeness of historical data can only be
      estimated.
      A second issue affecting the quality of historical data is perspective. As with
      individual archival records, historical data are not created in a vacuum but
      are inflected by the perspectives and intentions of the individuals and institu-
      tions that create and curate them. In the case of the ICS archives, both
     Darnton and Joshi agree that the reports and catalogues often reveal more
      about British perceptions of Indian culture than about the publishing industry
      in that country. While historians frequently read against the grain created by

```

-----

```
  and Indian interests in the quarterly catalogues — such an approach is only
  possible if one first identifies the perspectives shaping the historical data at
  hand. As with archival records generally, perspective also affects preservation
  of historical data, with documents archived because of particular understand-
  ings of significance, rather than at random or because they represent the
  range of activities in which particular individuals, companies or institutions
  engaged. Whether book historians read archival records qualitatively or
  quantitatively, they face similar challenges, and these require analysis of the
  archive itself as well as examination of its contents.
   Closely related to perspective is the common problem for bibliometric
  studies of categorization or terminology. Darnton raises this issue with respect
  to the categorization of religious texts in the ICS annual reports. Noting that,
  ‘{iJn India, unlike England, religion was so broad as to be nearly coextensive
  with culture’, Darnton describes the difficulty — for contemporary scholars as
  well as British officials of the period — of ‘deciding whether a particular book
  should be categorised under religion or philosophy or poetry’. Such difficulties,
  which obviously influence the results of analysis, are not particular to data from
  other cultures. Rather, they are endemic to all quantitative representations of
  culture specifically because this approach requires that a range of qualities,
  experiences or artefacts be collected under a limited number of headings or
  categories. As Weedon writes, ‘[c]ategorization is a useful tool to group
  together similarities whether through the putting together of books by genre,
  authors by social background, or publishers by turnover’, and this process “aids
  the analysis of broader historical trends which could not be understood other-
  wise’.'* However, the creation of categories also inevitably occludes variations
  and differences within the historical record.
  A number of methods — ranging from detailed knowledge of the data to
  sophisticated statistical approaches to gauge probability and error — exist to
  counteract these common challenges in bibliometric studies. In Eliot’s
  words, all aim to use quantitative resources ‘to the full without asking
  them to bear a weight of interpretation that they are not strong enough to
  carry’. Detailed knowledge of one’s data —a ‘biography of a data source’ —is
  a key first step.’® Producing such a ‘biography’ requires asking and answer-
  ing as many questions as possible about the data: Who compiled it? When
  was it created? What selection criteria were used in its construction? What
  was the purpose of the information and who was it intended for? Why has it
  been kept and by whom, and what physical, social or material circum-
  stances have affected its curation? If the data has been managed or created
  by a professional archivist, librarian or bibliographer, that person should be

     ascertaining data quality, including coverage and accuracy, the perspectives
     involved and the terminology used. Employing multiple sources also pro-
     vides an important means of gauging the reliability of data as well as
     counteracting gaps in the record.
      While the majority of quantitative studies in book history use very basic
      statistical methods, more sophisticated techniques have been employed by such
     scholars as Simon Eliot and Alexis Weedon. Even with simple statistical
     approaches — such as counts and proportions — an understanding of such issues
      as sampling, timescales, data fluctuations and data visualization are important.
      In terms of more sophisticated statistical methods, the most relevant for book
     history are those used in historical research, including measures of central
     tendency (mean, median and mode) and dispersion (range, variance and stan-
     dard deviation), frequency distributions, linear correlation statistics and other
      metrics of relationships between variables (such as categorical and continuous)
     and linear and multiple regression. All of these measures should be presented
     with error statistics, and thereby assessed for their level of statistical confidence.
     Good reference works exist for book historians wishing to develop skills in
      statistical methods. These are designed for use with statistical software, includ-
     ing the proprietary Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) or the free-to-
     download ‘R’ Statistical Package (which includes excellent online resources
     and discussion boards). Weedon also provides an introduction to sophisticated
      statistical approaches for book historians.*® Whatever level of statistical ana-
      lysis is employed, it is imperative to select an approach that suits the data, and
      the questions one intends to ask.
      Sophisticated statistical approaches have considerable potential in book
      history, but — in contrast to history and the social sciences — the field has no
     established tradition of using such methods. A number of scholars point to
     problems with this situation: Michael Suarez comments that, ‘[m]uch book
      historical work manifests a statistical innocence that impoverishes otherwise
     valuable research’, while St Clair argues that the relative absence of statistical
     approaches render this field, and the history of reading in particular, ‘at the
      stage of astronomy before telescopes’, ill-equipped to ‘describe, understand,
     and theorise complex systems’. The incorporation of such methods into book
     history will take time. Where Saurez complains that book historians are
     unable to understand and learn from relevant statistical research in other
      disciplines (intended for audiences familiar with statistics), book historians
     who incorporate sophisticated statistical methods — or collaborate with
      statistical experts — will obviously be faced with a different problem of
     audience: namely, that the predominant readers of their work (other book

   All these methods for working with historical data — from knowing your
  source well to the careful application of statistical methods — are designed to
  assist in counteracting common problems relating to the quality and compo-
  sition of historical data. But no matter how well one applies these methods, it
  is impossible to discover, create or claim a perfect data set. In an important
  way, book historians will always be left — as in Darnton and Joshi’s discussion
  of the ICS archives — arguing for the value and reliability or, more accurately,
  the extent of the value and reliability, of the historical data they employ
  (whether those arguments are made primarily with reference to the person-
  alities and institutions involved in creating and curating the data, or through
  statistical analyses of error and confidence). This awareness of the inevitable
  limitations of historical data has motivated some scholars to offer metaphors
  or analogies to describe the type of knowledge achievable using quantitative
  methods, and Darnton is surely the most inventive in this respect. For
  instance, he argues that, in struggling with statistics, ‘the historian works
  like a diagnostician who searches for patterns in symptoms rather than a
  physicist who turns hard data into firm conclusions’. Elsewhere, he compares
  the ‘general picture of literary culture’ offered by historical statistics to ‘the
  early maps of the New World, which showed the contours of the continents,
  even though they did not correspond very well to the actual landscape’.*®
  These metaphors emphasize the importance of quantitative methods in book
  history, in particular their capacity to enable analysis of and insight into
  aspects of the field that would not otherwise be possible. At the same time,
  they highlight the importance of established methods (akin to those used by
  the diagnostician or map maker) for understanding the nature and composi-
  tion of the sources used, and warn against an interpretation of those results as
  the truth or final word on historical phenomena.
             Reading the digital archive
  Digital technology is challenging the definition of, and how we use, archives.
 The term ‘digital archive’ can be used to refer to almost anything existing in
  digital form from discrete collections of related electronic documents (such as
  the Rossetti Archive or Emily Dickinson Electronic Archives); to digitized
  versions of existing material archives (for example, the Nineteenth Century
  British Library Newspaper Database or the National Library of Australia’s
 Trove Newspaper database); commercial databases (including academic
  search and citation engines such as JSTOR and Web of Knowledge); and
 emerging digital libraries (most prominently, Google Books, but also
                            [and ] [HathiTrust)."” ]

```

```
      historians, and the term has even been ascribed to the internet itself.*°
     Multiple archival resources relevant to book history have now been digitized,
     including many of the sources already discussed in this chapter. To give just a
      small selection of possible examples, projects such as the Australian Common
     Reader and What Middletown Read provide access to rich databases of
      library records, while the Stationers’ Company archives as well as many
      national bibliographical records — including AustLit, for Australia, and
     Canadiana, for Canada — are now available in digital form.
      The benefits of digitizing archives have been widely acknowledged. Chief
     among them are increased access and decreased cost. While archival material
      can be widely dispersed in the physical world, digitized archives can be
     accessed from a computer terminal, reducing the need for researchers to
      find the money and time to travel to archives. This additional time potentially
     allows research into a greater number and range of archives, encouraging
     expansion of the parameters by which scholars currently conceive of book
      history projects. Digitization of archival material also increases search
     options. While search possibilities differ between digital archives, many
     provide facilities to search by words or even concepts, and thus enable
     researchers to identify references and records they would only otherwise
      find serendipitously. Increasingly, book history projects generate their own
      digital archives. This output will enhance sharing of resources and the like-
     lihood that existing projects will be expanded, including through collabora-
      tion between researchers in different places.
      The increased access to archival records provided by digitization benefits
     both qualitative and quantitative approaches to reading the archive. In
      respect to the former, researchers can view documents before visiting the
      archive, the better to formulate research questions and approaches, or
     compare individual records held at different locations. For quantitative
     approaches, many digital archives provide access to large amounts of data.
      For instance, one can search an online bibliography for information about
      particular authors, texts, publishers and so on; but this information can also
     be extracted or ‘mined’ as quantitative lists or metadata (whether using
      inbuilt searches and facilitated extraction, or by creating automated searches
     and data harvesting programs). The access to data provided by digital
      archives greatly increases the potential speed and viability of bibliometric
      studies. For such studies, digital humanities initiatives also provide increas-
      ingly sophisticated and user-friendly tools for managing, analysing and
      visualizing historical data, including Zotero, TAPOR, Mallett and Gephi.
     Even Excel — software that might now be considered ‘old-fashioned’ — offers a

   Arguably, it is in the visualization of data — including geospatial data — that
 new technology holds the most exciting possibilities for book history. The
 “Mapping the World Republic of Letters’ project, for instance, visualizes
  the trajectories of over 55,000 letters between 6,400 correspondents in the
  Electronic Enlightenment database to represent intellectual networks in this
  period and provoke new insights into how ideas circulated. Among other
  projects that demonstrate the new possibilities for book history of geospatial
  analysis, the Innerpeffray Library Project uses geographical information
  systems (GIS) technology to visualize borrowing distances and patterns for
  Scotland’s first public lending library. While GIS is not without potential
  difficulties — particularly, identifying suitable data and analysing trends over
  time — computer technologies promise to expand significantly the presence
  and impact of geographical research for book history. More broadly, digital
  humanities researchers are proposing new ways of conceptualizing the visual-
  ization of data that could be usefully incorporated into book history. As
 computers enable data to be manipulated and represented in multiple ways,
 computer visualizations can provide a form of hypothesis testing, as described
  in Willard McCarty’s Humanities Computing (2005). Alternatively, data
  visualization can be understood as a speculative and intuitive process that
  provokes researchers to new questions, thus functioning as a problem-
  generating rather than problem-solving strategy.**
   While digital archives and methods for reading them have enormous
  potential for book history, this trend presents its own challenges for reading
  the archival record. The emphasis that is sometimes placed on the ‘seemingly
  infinite’ potential of digital archives — including ‘unprecedented access to rare
  or inaccessible materials; comprehensiveness . . . [and] consolidation’ — down-
  plays the many aspects of our cultural heritage that are not being, or cannot
  be, translated to digital form.** Issues preventing digitization include funding,
  copyright and storage space. Digitizing documents to appropriate scholarly
  standards is often very time-consuming and, hence, expensive, so even when
  archives are digitized, they may not be in forms useful to researchers.
 Although the situation is improving as book historians become involved in
  digitization initiatives, some existing projects do not incorporate aspects of
  the archive important for book history, such as the covers and title pages of
  books, the size of pages and the nature of bindings. Other aspects of print
  culture — including the weight, smell and feel of the material record — are
  difficult or impossible to represent digitally. The danger also exists that a
  single digitized record will be considered sufficient to represent all versions of
  a work (regardless of the manifestation [and ] [physical ] [characteristics, ] [such ] [as ]
 marginalia and other page markings). If these other versions are neglected or

```
     access to the cultural record. Some commentators also point to a canonical
     focus in digitization projects, with records of well-known authors and institu-
     tions translated into digital form, while others are overlooked.
                    Conclusion
     This chapter has not presented one mode of reading the archive — qualitative
     or quantitative — or one type of archive — material or digital — as inherently
     preferable. Rather, different approaches are necessary for different questions,
     and different archives are useful for different purposes. As Eliot writes, with-
     out qualitative case studies, we would lack the ‘texture and taste of book-
    making humanity’; without quantitative studies we would lack ‘the context to
     confer ... a proper significance’ on the details of the case studies.** Likewise,
     despite some recent portrayals of digital archives as superior to the ‘analogue’
     version, these new archives bring their own challenges, as well as possibilities,
     for book history. Ultimately, where a particular project might necessitate a
     particular method or mode of access, only a combination of approaches and
     resources is sufficient to provide adequate insights for book history more
     broadly.
      Jared Gardner provides a good example of this need for multiple methods of
     reading archives in describing his work on the rise of newspaper comics at the
     turn of the twentieth century. After researching this aspect of print culture using
     online archives — including the ‘underground electronic archive[s]’ of individual
     collectors — he went to the material archive to find an illustration, only to
     discover that, ‘In the “flesh”, these early comics supplements were different
     than anything I could imagine’, including in their size, colours and intertextual
     references to other parts of the paper.** Where the digital archives provided
     him with access to a breadth of materials — including materials that would
     otherwise have remained within non-institutional collections — researching the
     individual documents in the material archive offered him a different, and no less
     important, understanding of this feature of print culture.

             MARY HAMMOND
  Book history in the reading experience
 Argentinian-born critic Alberto Manguel’s optimistic view of reading as a
 universal practice, and of readers as all-powerful, addresses a set of questions
 which has informed a growing strand in book history research over the past
 two decades: the history of readers and reading:
   [I]n every case, it is the reader who reads the sense; it is the reader who grants or
   recognises in an object, place or event a certain possible readability; it is the
   reader who must attribute meaning to a system of signs, and then decipher it.
  We all read ourselves and the world around us in order to glimpse what and
   where we are. We read to understand, or to begin to understand. We cannot do
   but read. Reading, almost as much as breathing, is our essential function.’
 Ever since Robert Darnton, one of the founders of book history, first argued
 in 1986 that ‘Reading has a history’, increasing numbers of scholars have
 been wrestling with the questions that writing such a history inevitably pose.*
 What do we actually mean by ‘reading’? Is ‘reading’ a book the same thing as
 ‘reading’ a film, a play, a painting or a social situation, as Manguel implies? If
 we decide to take ‘reading’ in its most literal sense to mean active engagement
 with a text, then who during the act of reading is actually creating the mean-
 ing: the author, the reader or a combination of both? Does a book, a
 magazine, a manuscript or a document on a computer screen have any
 meaning (beyond its materiality as a bundle of paper and ink or an arrange-
 ment of pixels) before it has been scanned by a human eye (or a human finger)
 and processed by a human brain? What contribution does the editor, printer,
 publisher, illustrator, paper-maker, binder or software designer make? Is
 meaning the same in every case, for every reader? How does meaning — and
 the specific conditions which help to create it - change over time and space
 and across different media? And how can historians capture traces of reading
 experiences which may be - and usually are — ephemeral and unrecorded?
 This chapter aims to show some of the ways in which these important

```

                 The politics of reading
     For Manguel the reader is in charge of meaning, and conceptually the act of
     reading extends beyond the trained deciphering of marks on a surface (or
     pixels on a screen) to the ‘reading’ of one’s place in the world. Indeed, in
     Manguel’s view these things are essentially codependent: the reading of a text
     draws on and grows out of this other, more basic part of human social
     behaviour, becoming almost as natural a function as breathing. But for
     most book historians, this is a problematic formulation. Book historians
     might continue to argue over whether the history of reading ought to encom-
     pass other ‘reading’-related activities such as listening or viewing (which
     Manguel embraces quite easily), but most agree that reading in the book
     historical sense is not natural, but rather cultural. It implies an act of inter-
     pretation connected to a system of signs (writing, or other visual or physical
     mode of coding), which is in turn dependent on a set of learned behaviours
     and skills (reading). Learning to read, and being able to read competently,
     comfortably and openly, requires the presence of certain basic conditions
     such as access to education and to reading material, free time, good light,
     good eyesight or access to visual aids, and often the permission of whichever
     authority controls these things (whether a parent, a teacher, a priest or a set of
     laws.) The availability of these essential prerequisites for reading changes
     according to context and across time and space, and is often the site of
     considerable struggle; there have in fact been many moments in history
     when for some people the act of reading — far from being natural — is difficult,
     impossible, or even downright dangerous.
      The nature of what reading potentially enables — primarily knowledge,
     whether political, religious, imaginative, scientific or sexual — is one common
     reason for this struggle. For example, a fourteenth-century person living in
     England and not versed in Latin was usually unable to read the Bible for him/
      herself. Indeed, the ecclesiastical reformer John Wycliffe’s 1382-95 transla-
      tions of parts of the Bible into vernacular Middle English, designed to enable
     ordinary readers to study scripture for themselves, were considered heretical
     by the Roman Catholic authorities then in power in the country. But ideas
     about appropriate access to knowledge change over time. A hundred years
      later religious power had shifted and with it notions about the function
     of reading: late fifteenth-century Protestant church-goers were positively
     encouraged through a number of contemporary works to read and interpret
     the bible for themselves as part of their devotional practice.? Similar examples
     of reading being controlled or prohibited continue throughout history. In the
     antebellum southern states of America it was against the law for slaves to

```

 antebellum America (both North and South) did read, and that during and
 after the American Civil War of 1861-5 freed or runaway slaves still living in
 the South clubbed together to form secret impromptu schools and self-help
 literacy groups in the face of these threats.4 The courage and determination
 which readers often demonstrate only serves to highlight the difficult - and
 clearly historically specific — conditions under which they are sometimes
 forced to operate.
  The power that comes from knowledge is one issue. But the pleasure which
 reading provides has long been another bone of social contention. In many
 cultures, private reading was or still is a problem because it defies moral
 policing: no one can monitor a reader’s thoughts, or control his or her
 emotional (or indeed physical) responses to a text. For this reason, in addition
 to restricting the access of certain social groups to literacy skills as a way of
 restricting their knowledge, reading materials have throughout history also
 often been controlled as a way of policing a reader’s pleasure. One obvious
 result of this was the Obscene Publications Act of 1857 in England, which
 sought to control the spread of pornography. But there are other, more
 complex examples. Women have often been subjected to restrictions on
 their reading; even novels were deemed inappropriate for western women
 during much of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries due to their perceived
 romantic (for which read sexual) content.* Similarly, in many developing
 countries there has long been and often still continues to be a marked
 disparity in literacy rates between men and women, and most experts
 acknowledge that this has as much to do with the ideology of separate
 spheres, which denies women access to knowledge and pleasure beyond
 their roles as wives and mothers, as with an economic system which finds
 investment in female education unsustainable.®
  History offers many more examples of cultures whose populations are
 divided along ideological lines between ‘readers’ and ‘non-readers’. Not all
 of these are motivated by the overt politics of race, state, gender or religion,
 either: many of us know people even today who deem reading a waste of time,
 or an effete pleasure inimical to more ‘healthy’ pursuits such as sport.
 Reading, then, is a practice which, while in many cultures it might be com-
 monplace, is also always complicated. It can be highly political and conten-
 tious even in those same cultures where it seems to be the most natural. If we
 are to attempt to understand how reading and readers operate, we need to
 account for and try to record both the obvious and the more subtle and less
 visible forces exerted on different readers and their experiences, since these
 forces encompass issues of gender, [generation, ] [region, ] [sexuality, ] [class ] [and ]

      interpreted, persuaded, informed, controlled, liberated or entertained our-
      selves in the past, and the means through which we have sought to do so.
     Investigating this history requires considerable detective work.
                The problem of evidence
     One of the problems facing historians of reading (something, intriguingly,
      that they share with historians of sexuality), is the paucity and unreliability of
      the evidence. Most reading acts in history remain unrecorded, unmarked or
      forgotten; many others have (for what should by now be obvious reasons)
     been deliberately hidden or falsified. There are exceptions, of course, and
      these tend to be recent, western and canonical: we know a lot about what
     famous eighteenth- and nineteenth-century figures such as William Ewart
     Gladstone or Charles Dickens read because we have many of their letters
     and records of the contents of their libraries. In fact, the nineteenth century is
     one of the eras for which we have a great deal of information even for less
     famous readers because it represents the great age of mass reading in the
     western world due to increasing literacy rates, technological advances in
      printing, and a developing curiosity about social and cultural habits which
     gave rise to the era of the survey. The survey method has produced some very
      useful data since, too: projects such as Mass Observation (UK, 1937 to the
      early 1950s) reveal a great deal about what ordinary people read and how
     and when and where they read in the first half of the twentieth century. Still
     more recently several scholars have carried out their own surveys of reading
     communities both in and beyond the West: see, for example, Jonathan Rose’s
     book on working-class readers in the nineteenth- and twentieth-century UK,
     Janice Radway’s work on twentieth-century American Book Clubs, the
     Australian Common Reader Project and Hanna Adoni and Hillel Nosek’s
     survey of media consumption habits in twenty-first-century Israel.” In our
     own time, blogs and online purchaser reviews such as those logged by
     Amazon.com tell us a great deal about readers’ responses to texts worldwide.
     But to find out what people in more ancient cultures read (and indeed what
     they meant by ‘reading’), or what semi-literate or secret or just downright
     ordinary and therefore forgotten readers read in the past is a different matter
      altogether.
      Historians of reading have used a variety of methods to capture, analyse
     and try to understand the reading experiences of the past, both the canoni-
      cal and the quotidian. First, as readership historian Shafquat Towheed has
     remarked, many book historians agree that ‘texts cannot be analysed out-

 means that before we approach the problem of a reader’s engagement witha
 text, we must examine the social and cultural spaces in which the reading
  act is likely to have taken place. Manuscripts, scrolls, clay tablets, books,
 magazines, posters, cereal packets, exam papers, letters, graffiti, texts, blogs
 and email and everything else carrying sets of readable symbols are all
 defined by very different physical properties which determine the kinds of
 spaces and contexts in which they are likely to be encountered, and this
 materiality has an impact on the reading experience itself. These spaces and
 contexts are historically and geographically specific: an advertisement in an
 eighteenth-century gentleman’s periodical (designed to be perused at lei-
  sure, usually while seated in a relatively quiet space such as a coffee house or
 library) is not at all the same thing as a neon sign in twenty-first-century
 Tokyo (designed to catch the eye of a hurried urban passer-by and impart its
 message at speed while competing for attention with myriad other appeals
  to the senses). Public or private libraries, places of worship, living rooms,
 bedrooms, cafes, classrooms, book clubs and reading groups, bathrooms,
 train carriages, the open streets — all these and many others offer reading
 venues in their own particular ways. Changes in communication practices —
 the advent of mobile phone technology, for example — also continually
 create new reading spaces and may even create new laws: texting is now
 ubiquitous in many countries, for example, but texting while driving is now
 an offence in most of them.
  So what can ‘reading’ the spaces of reading tell us? Social historian Alistair
 Black’s work on British Public Libraries since 1850 has been able to demon-
 strate that the design of public reading spaces in the modern British context
 created a form of social censorship, preventing readers from browsing and —
 through a culture of silence — trying to prevent them from discussing their
 reading in situ. But he also suggests that readers have always found ways
 around these strictures. They discuss their reading in whispers or by passing
 notes; where they are denied access to the shelves they discuss recommenda-
 tions with colleagues, friends and family instead. And some readers — usually
 in groups — break the rules in the library, disrupting other readers and each
 other. Censorship itself may thus have created new ways of reading, and new
 communities of readers.’ Similarly, Ian Desai has recently shown that while
 the Indian revolutionary Mahatma Gandhi was not in his youth a great
 reader, long years spent in British prisons exchanging books (and readers’
 annotations in books) with fellow prisoners changed his habits, so that ‘jail
 sentences became opportunities for collective engagement with books and
 collaborative mobilization of the information and ideas within them ... the

      Reading spaces continue to exert an influence today: the 2or1 publishing
     phenomenon Fifty Shades of Grey, an erotic trilogy by E. L. James, has often
      been said to owe its early success to the discreet nature of e-readers, and its
     ongoing success to Twitter.com and internet blogs. Ever since the nineteenth
      century it has been acknowledged that reading in public spaces such as
      train carriages serves a number of social functions, from avoiding the gazes
      of predatory fellow-passengers to advertising one’s literary taste. But the
      e-reader has recently enabled the hiding of a book’s cover so that the passen-
      ger sitting opposite cannot judge your book — or, by extension, you — at all.
     There is no doubt a great deal of freedom in this (though perhaps also missed
      opportunities for making an impression). New social media technology has
      also enabled the sharing of tips, ideas and opinions about reading on an
     unprecedented scale. This has profoundly affected both the publishing indus-
      try and the reading experience: ‘word of mouth’ has gone viral. One problem
      for future reading historians, indeed, will be how to capture and analyse so
     much e-communication.
       Fifty Shades of Grey’s success as an e-book serves to indicate that a text’s
      physical properties are also of prime importance in helping to determine the
      nature of reading experiences, and this is something else which readership
      historians look to as evidence. In the pre-printing-press era (prior to the
      seventh century in East Asia and the mid-fifteenth century in the West),
     manuscripts were painstakingly hand-scribed and sometimes coloured (‘illu-
      minated’) and adorned with gold to indicate the devotion of a particular
     monastic order or the wealth and importance of a particular patron. The
      writers were craftsmen, the manuscripts expensive and the readers few and
      privileged. By the eighteenth century the price of producing many texts had
     come down and literacy rates were increasing, but books were still out of
      reach for many people and the gentleman’s library in which volumes were
     bound identically in leather (often to match the owner’s library furnishings or
      to illustrate his family’s wealth) was still the norm. By the mid-nineteenth
      century efficient mass-production meant still wider reading audiences, and
      texts that were designed to appeal to a far more diverse range of reading
      tastes.'* Publishers began to compete for these markets, and some of the key
     methods through which they did so were the use of advertising and the
     adoption of eye-catching book jackets. Books were not the only types of
      text to receive a material makeover either: the tabloid newspaper — which
      (not coincidentally) gets its name from the nineteenth-century invention of
     pre-measured medicine in tablet form — has since the 1880s been the arche-
      typal traveller’s medium, designed for those who want news or information
      quickly. The broadsheet, by contrast, always declared itself to be aimed at

 smaller print and longer articles more slowly. It was only in 2004 that The
 Times — after more than 200 years as a broadsheet — decided to relaunch in
 tabloid format to reflect its readership’s increasingly transient lifestyle.
 Advertising has undergone similar changes, with the text-heavy and image-
 light advertisements of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries
 (a result of the high price of reproducing quality illustrations in this period)
 becoming increasingly image-based during the 1870s and afterwards. The
 effect of this on readers was profound: if in 1845 a reader stood at a train
 station and read the advertising posters he or she would have been confronted
 with a wall of small print which required time to process. In the twenty-first
 century, station advertising is increasingly a matter of deciphering clever
 images (sometimes entirely without text, or bearing only a brand name), or
 working out the relationship between an image and its associated, often
 cryptic, accompanying text.
  We all read in different ways according to our — and our text’s — physical,
 cultural and historical context. A text entitled Pride and Prejudice: a Novel in
 Three Volumes by The Author of Sense and Sensibility, first published with-
 out the author’s name by T. Egerton of Whitehall in 1813 at the relatively
 high price of 18 shillings, is a very different thing from a modern scholarly
 edition of Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen with an explanatory introduc-
 tion, copious scholarly notes and essays in the back, at a price most students
 can afford. Is it the same novel? To a point. Is the experience of reading it the
 same in both cases? Not exactly. A reader living contemporaneously with
 Austen (let us call her Reader A), privileged enough to be able to read in 1813
 when literacy rates were around 65 per cent for men and 50 per cent for
 women (with illiteracy highest among the poor), and wealthy enough to be
 able to afford 18 shillings for a novel (more than a week’s wages for most
 people) or pay for a circulating library subscription, is not having the same
 experience as a student reader in the twenty-first century (let us call him
 Reader B) wading through a paperback copy while taking notes for the
 following day’s class. Reader A is likely to have plenty of leisure time and a
 private comfortable place in which to read (unless she belongs to a household
 which discourages novel-reading, in which case she is likely to be reading in
 secret.) And she receives her copy in three volumes, possibly from a circulat-
 ing library, which means she might have to wait a week or more for one
 of them.
  By contrast, Reader B has a deadline, and he might never have picked up
 the book at all had it not been for the syllabus which insisted that he do so. It’s
 also unlikely that he will be [reading ] [in ] [secret ] [(though ] [his ] [mates ] [might ]

     Reader A is anxious to read the latest work by a talked-about anonymous
      novelist, Reader B is anxious to get a good grade. There might be (and those of
      us who teach literature hope there always is) pleasure involved for the reader
      in both reading experiences, but the pleasure is of a different type in each case.
      It is prompted by different impulses, and mediated through what (following
      French literary theorist Gérard Genette) have come to be known as the text’s
      paratexts, by which we mean everything outside the text not usually con-
      structed by the author such as a text’s cover, size, font, introduction or
      preface, end- or footnotes, endpapers, colophon etc. All these help a reader
      to interpret the text in a particular way, regardless of the author’s contribu-
      tion. A cover illustration forms our expectations. The notes and introduction
      guide our interpretation of the text. The presence of the word ‘Classic’ on the
      spine or in the jacket blurb, or the knowledge that our friends will want our
      opinion on this new book the next time we see them, both feed in different
     ways into our sense of what and why we are reading. Reader A does not need
      footnotes to explain certain phrases or words that have lost or changed their
     meaning over time. Reader B probably does, but then he might also have seen
      a TV adaptation of the novel, or know that Bridget Jones’s Diary is a spin-off
      of it. Even the presence or absence of an author’s name (and reputation) helps
      to shape the reading experience, setting up our expectations based on what we
      already know, and what we hope to find out.
       But how do we know that these sorts of things mattered to real historical
      readers, and in what ways? Sometimes readers leave us with useful records of
      their experiences which do mention paratextual details as significant. Perhaps
      unsurprisingly given his profession, Manguel is one such reader: he tells us
      that while he was growing up in the cities of Buenos Aires and Tel Aviv in the
      1950s and 1960s, his ambassador father made a clear distinction between
      the leather-bound books he kept in his library and the cheap paperbacks he
      carelessly left outside on the patio table, from whence Manguel liked to rescue
     them ‘as if they were stray cats’.** But few readers untrained in literary theory
      or book history would think to record such details. A text’s material proper-
       ties — cover, design, weight, dimensions, price and so forth — must be impor-
      tant, or publishers would not invest so much energy in them. Indeed, as one
      experienced contemporary literary agent put it, nowadays paratexts are
      explicitly designed to ‘generate word of mouth’ about a book in order to
       sell more copies of it.*> But since for most readers these are unconscious
      influences and therefore go unrecorded, we must look for them elsewhere —
     namely in an educated assessment of the likely edition, provenance, condition
     and cultural significance of the text being read, as far as we are able to
      ascertain it. And that requires knowledge of book history more broadly: of

  prices and papermaking and printing technologies, and as many other perti-
  nent details as we can find. Analysis of the evidence of reading must always
 work in full partnership with other book history skill sets.
   Recent sustained work on collecting the evidence of reading serves to
  illustrate this issue. Scholars working on the Open University’s Reading
  Experience Database 1450-1945 (RED) have spent several years painstak-
  ingly collecting evidence from all over the British Isles of real readers’
  experiences, and still more recently have helped to create sister databases
  in New Zealand, Australia and the Netherlands.’* Drawn from diaries,
  autobiographies, letters, commonplace books and marginalia, these entries
  are useful in their own right. They certainly prove what a precarious process
  reading can be, as this entry dating from the 1850s suggests: ‘After break-
  fast’, the journeyman engineer Thomas Wright tells us, ‘I had taken up the
  “Weekly Examiner”, and was intent upon a more than usually scurrilous
  and illogical leading article, when the paper was suddenly snatched from my
  hands by my landlady, who sternly asked me if I thought reading a news-
  paper on a Sunday morning was proper behaviour in the house of a God-
  fearing couple.’** This is in itself an illuminating example of the politics of
  reading: we may with some justification ask ourselves what pleasure there
  was for Thomas in an article that he judged ‘scurrilous and illogical’, and we
  might also wonder what, in this period, was wrong with reading news-
  papers on a Sunday. Wright’s memories also provide interesting evidence of
  the fact that not all reading experiences are sustained or complete — readers
  get interrupted, or they must read in chunks, or they must go back and
  reread to remind themselves of something.
   But though RED contains over 30,000 fascinating entries like this, few of
  its included readers trouble to record the material properties of the works they
  discuss, or how they got hold of them. Readership historians need to be aware
  that collecting testimony is one thing, but the task of interpreting it is some-
  thing else because the data are often incomplete. With this in mind, the RED
  team had to be conscious not only to ask the right questions, but also to fill in
  the blanks as necessary. RED’s input forms contain fields for all sorts of data
  from title and genre of text through age, gender and socioeconomic group of
  the reader to date and place of reading experience. But in addition the data
  inputters have often had to make an educated guess at a text’s publication
  date where it was not specified, to enter missing details about an individual
  reader where these can be ascertained from some other source and even to
  correct readers’ sometimes erroneous memories of titles or authors’ names in
  an historically sensitive manner as appropriate. In short, we have had to

      There is another reason why we have to be cautious when analysing
     evidence drawn from real reading experiences: not only is the human memory
      a fallible thing, subject to error, but readers do not always tell the truth, or the
     same story to each listener. The politics of reading mobilizes a whole web of
     potential meanings which are by definition unstable, because the act of read-
     ing (and what we choose to read or to say we read) carries significance far
     beyond words on a page. For example, when asked by three different people —
      say, a teacher, a scientifically minded boyfriend and a best friend — to name
     her favourite book, a teenager might give three different answers: to the
     teacher she might say Dickens’s Great Expectations, to the boyfriend she
     might say Stephen Hawking’s A Brief History of Time and to her best friend
     she might claim Stephenie Meyer’s Twilight. Or she might just as easily tell
     one or all of them that she despises reading and prefers music; readership
     historians also need to be sensitive to a potential reader’s freedom not to read
      (or not to admit that she reads). Which of these is true of our teenager? We
     cannot know for sure; we must always analyse such data with one careful eye
      on the context in which it was provided. To give a more concrete example,
     when asked by the British right-wing tabloid the Sun to name his favourite
     childhood book, British Conservative Party Prime Minister David Cameron
      said it was Our Island Story, by H. E. Marshall: ‘This is a children’s history of
      Britain, from the Romans to the death of Queen Victoria’, he explained,
      ‘written in a way that captured my imagination and nurtured my interest in
     the history of our great nation.’*® While acknowledging the possible truthful-
      ness of Cameron’s declared choice, a readership historian would be inclined
     (and wise) to consider that his explanation might reveal as much about his
      office and the political views of his readers as his literary taste.
      Of course, readers do not always leave evidence of their reading in quite so
     fulsome or public a manner. They also note down mere titles of books they
     have read in private journals, discuss (and indeed argue about) their reading
      in letters to close friends and family and leave notes or scribbles in books for
      their own purposes. RED collects evidence from all of these sources and they
     have been just as illuminating as those taken from memoirs, though they bring
      their own problems too. Entries such as the one below come from marginal
      notes found in a book, and they indicate that in this case the reader (one Jon
     Drummond Erskine, born 1776 in Scotland and later to become a landowner
      in India) not only took his reading very seriously, but was able to write as well
      as read in more than one language. The entry describes: ‘Some pencil marks
     and marginal MS notes throughout the text. Generally they highlight points
      of grammar or translation, mostly in English but at least one is in Persian
      (p. 132).’'7 In this case, we know who the scribbler was. But scribbles are

  some situations, such as while studying texts in an archive, it is possible to
  date or narrow down the source of the marginalia based on the handwriting,
  the text’s provenance (the presence of a bookplate bearing an owner’s name,
  for example), and/or the care with which it has been policed in its current
  location (scribbling in books after they find their way into an archive being
  generally frowned upon). But in less closely monitored contexts (such as in a
  contemporary public library, or when purchasing from a second-hand web-
  site or store) it is usually impossible to tell when the marks were made, beyond
  noting that it must have been before the present moment of their discovery.
  These anonymous marks can be useful in themselves: they can tell us, for one
  thing, that a particular book was not just borrowed (or bought, or given as a
  present), but that it was actually quite carefully engaged with by a reader. This
  is something that sales figures and library borrowing records alone cannot do
  (useful as they are in other ways).
   Readership historians usually want proof that a text has actually made it
  out of the seller’s wrapper or off the pile of library books by the bed, that it has
  been scanned by a reader’s eyes and processed by a reader’s brain, whether in
  whole or in part. Marginalia provide that proof. In some cases marginalia can
  do more than that: sometimes readers’ notes are quite comprehensive, or
  quite specific, and they can help us to understand how at least one person
  interpreted a text. But even the least specific or the most basic marginalia can
  also indicate patterns or trends. As Heather Jackson — an expert in eighteenth-
  century marginalia — has demonstrated, while many books from the
  Romantic period contain the owner’s bookplate or other identifying marks
  (so we know whose marginalia we are looking at and when it is likely to have
  been written) even those that do not are useful since the very prevalence and
  extent of marginalia in them is unusual by modern standards and demon-
  strates how reading practices change over time. As she explains, while in
 many periods and cultures it is normal practice to keep a book pristine (as
  Manguel’s father did with his leather-bound library copies in twentieth-
  century Buenos Aires), based on the practice’s prevalence, to the eighteenth-
  century reader scribbling in the margins even of an expensive leather-bound
  book ‘must have felt like a natural thing to do’.*® Still, Jackson is careful to
  situate her analysis of this practice in the context of broader changes in the
  industrial and social landscapes. In this case, her theory is supported by the
  material evidence in many eighteenth-century books of blank spaces left by
  publishers for readers’ comments, and of discussions between eighteenth-
  century readers themselves. Jackson’s work reminds us that studying margin-
  alia on its own, like collecting [readers’ ] [testimonies, ] [is ][akin ] [to ] [reading ] [a ] [book ]

      The problem of evidence is complicated still further when we want to
     compare reading experiences over time, since different conditions for reading
     and for preserving the evidence of reading prevail in different temporal and
     national contexts. Some climates are better than others for preservation
     purposes: the Middle Eastern climate is good, but that of India is not.
     Preservation can also be a result of the choice of materials: parchment gen-
      erally survives better than papyrus, for example. Equally, sometimes preser-
     vation comes down to luck: volcanic ash in Herculaneum preserved some of
     the contents of one Roman library, while Second World War bombing
     destroyed many publishers’ and booksellers’ records in London. But generally
     speaking, scarcity of evidence is usually a result of there being comparatively
     few readers and texts in a given culture, and such scarcity is always com-
     pounded by age. As a result, compared with the evidence available from the
     eighteenth century onwards, there is relatively little available for ancient
     cultures, so what there is requires particularly careful analysis.
      The discovery of the Rosetta Stone on the west bank of the Nile in 1799 is a
     good example of the uses to which writing traces may be put. Famously,
     because the Rosetta Stone carries roughly the same proclamation in three
      different types of script — Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, Middle Demotic
      script and Ancient Greek — early nineteenth-century scholars who knew
     Greek were able to teach themselves to decipher hieroglyphs for the first
     time (and what a reading experience that must have been!). But the presence
     of the same message in three languages also indicates a historically specific
     writing and reading context. The Stone was carved in about 196 BCE in a
     fraught bi-cultural society (the Ptolemaic Kingdom, 330-32 BCE) whose
      political decrees had to appeal equally to both the Greek and the Egyptian
     cultures coexisting uneasily under Ptolemaic rule. The Stone also demon-
      strates language in transition and thus a particularly skilled readership: the
     established Middle Demotic language was in the process of being replaced by
     Ancient Greek as the lingua franca of law and politics. Building on this
     evidence, recent scholarly work has been able to explore the ways in which
      the power struggle between these different languages and cultures continued
      to be enacted for readers through other types of text, including poetry.’?
     Many reading contexts offer similar complexities and sometimes, as here, we
     have to build up a picture of reading experiences from very little evidence,
      inferring the reading act solely from the fragments accessible to us.
                 Theoretical approaches
     Thus far we have examined historical acts of reading through traces inscribed

                           of their practices.
  book historians also set great store by economics and the material evidence of
  printing and distribution such as print runs, pricing, editions, book sales,
  library records, fan letters and educational practices. All of these can be
  invaluable in helping us to build up a picture of how, what, where and
  when readers read in the past and, as I have shown, they can often help fill
  in some of the blanks left by readers’ own testimonies. But these sorts of
  empirical approaches are not the only ways in which reading has been
  examined and understood. They were in fact predated by theories of reading
  which, emerging in Europe and the US in the 1960s and 1970s and known as
  ‘reader-response criticism’, sought to address the heavily author and text-
  based trend in literary studies which had prevailed there throughout the first
  half of the twentieth century. These theories can be extremely useful to read-
  ership historians as a way of supporting an understanding of reading acts,
  particularly where the evidence for them is scarce.
   One of the first challenges to the idea that meaning is controlled exclusively
  by the author came from French critic Roland Barthes, who complained that
  much contemporary criticism tended to privilege the author as the sole
  purveyor of meaning and assume that the text serves merely as a means to
  understand that author’s mental processes. Feeling that this approach served
  to glorify the literary critic doing the interpreting rather than aid in an
  understanding of the work, he offered an alternative model in which writing,
  rather than occurring in a vacuum and being the product of individual genius,
  can be seen instead as ‘a tissue of quotations drawn from the innumerable
  centres of culture’.*° This new emphasis on situating a text in culture and
  history was to have significant impact on contemporary critics who saw it as
  offering a new way of thinking about the act of textual interpretation itself. If
  a text is not the product of individual genius but part of an exchange of
  memories, ideas and stories (‘quotations’) drawn from many different histor-
  ical and geographical locations, then a reader will need a particular set of
  competencies in order to understand it fully. In turn, this means that every
  reader will read the same text differently according to his or her particular
  experience — and that some will understand it more fully than others. This is
  the argument of the German critic Wolfgang Iser, who identified for the first
  time the work that a reader has to do to make sense of a text.*" For Iser, every
  text contains gaps which a reader must fill in. Some gaps are placed there by
  the author as part of the work’s structural strategy: crime fiction is an obvious
  example of a genre in which filling in the gaps (working out ‘whodunnit’) is a
  large part of the pleasure. But other gaps might be a result of different forces
  not put there deliberately by the author, but constituting nonetheless a crucial

   Book history in the classroom
 Many scholars whose research includes the history of the book have lately
 become committed to transferring their knowledge to a new generation of
 learners. This is a recent phenomenon: only since about the turn of the
 millennium has a topic called ‘book history’ been offered to undergradu-
 ates. In earlier decades, a handful of advanced students were instructed
 in what was then identified as bibliography — and only in large research
 universities in Europe and North America enjoying long traditions of
 literary scholarship and furnished with rich collections of rare books and
 manuscripts. Many of that older generation of students were reluctant
 learners, forced into mandatory studies construed as a standard introduc-
 tion to literary scholarship. Only a few became inspired to embrace biblio-
 graphical knowledge for its own sake, whether in a literary, a library or
 another setting. Book-history students of the twenty-first century, however,
 may have little or no knowledge of literary or historical scholarship; per-
 haps they even lack the experience of reading for pleasure; their college and
 university libraries may own very few old and rare books — indeed, access to
 rare books may even be limited to an image on the internet. Far from being
 experienced as limitations, such challenges are intellectually liberating,
 allowing instructors and students to think in fundamental ways about
 what they mean by the book, its history and its place in the world where
 they have grown up.
  Approaches vary widely according to discipline, nationality and chrono-
 logical focus, and from the ambitious to the prosaic, but it is possible to identify
 some connecting themes, and some of the inherent challenges and opportu-
 nities. This chapter argues that the study of the history and culture of the book
 offers a valuable way to help students to understand some key institutions of
 contemporary society — the media of communication, the libraries, the litera-
 ture and the journalism. So-called ‘digital natives’, those who were born into an

     tions and ‘new media’ with which they are familiar into juxtaposition with ‘old’
     media and their development over centuries.
      At its most ambitious, the history of the book has the potential to serve as
     framework for a global history of knowledge and culture. The book’s long
     trajectory and dramatic turning points (marks on clay, codex, moveable
     type, steam and stereotype, paperback, competition with broadcast media,
     pixels on screen) provide a coherent narrative spine for introducing trans-
     national history. Encompassing all aspects of the written record, but also
     taking the historical nature of communication as its very subject, the book
     embraces a chronology coterminous with the recorded history of human-
     kind. And even though it takes the written record as its subject, the study of
     book history nevertheless also includes aspects of oral culture: scholarship
     in the long history of the book can scarcely avoid interrogating the ways
     in which knowledge and stories have passed between the traditions of the
     spoken word and those of inscription, handwriting, printing and digital
     media. It has a built-in point of view from which interpretations can
     be critically engaged: the recognition that readers, the book trade and
     writers share experience, and compete for authority, in overlapping net-
     works of text and context, material form and interpretation. Hence, for
     example, a Eurocentric bias is difficult to sustain in the face of Asia’s
     precedence in the art of printing with moveable types; but equally, as the
     historian Christopher Reed’s research demonstrates, mechanized printing
     in nineteenth-century Shanghai functioned in a world that was proudly
     conscious of that long-ago primacy. *
      Furthermore, and again at its most ambitious, the history of the book has
     the potential to frame a materialist approach to the study of written texts. In
      this teaching and learning scenario, the artistic contribution of authors is
     not denied, but the student learns how to engage critically with the myth of
     authorial genius.* Literary scholars who are book historians interrogate the
     material nature of the novels, poems and essays whose aesthetic and formal
     nature has been their discipline’s primary concern. Students can use these
     scholarly studies as entry points to a sometimes daunting body of knowl-
     edge, the canon (and the counter-canons) of literary works. To engage with
     textual studies is to think seriously about the forensic traces that are left
     behind by printers, editors, designers, publishers and other collaborators in
     the disposition of an author’s words on the pages of multiple and variant
     editions of a work. Because it shows how the text became entangled in its
     material carrier, book history provides a framework, or point of view, that
     can highlight literary work’s textuality. Another important contribution

                                 ‘best’ or ‘most
 representative’ works of a national heritage may have been published by a
 firm working closely with that nation’s critical establishment.’
  In studies of culture and communication, meanwhile, the history of the
 book has the potential to frame the contemporary media of internet, film,
 television and radio in a richer theoretical context. Journalism and other
 forms of presentation (documentaries, features, phone-in commentary and
 feedback) are merely the latest manifestations of news delivery, and con:
 temporary broadcast and social media are successors to the print, manu-
 script and oral technologies that worked in specific past societies. Popular
 culture’s sophisticated awareness of how film-makers adapt texts for the
 screen can be extrapolated to an understanding of how Victorian novels
 that appeared to be the single-handed creation of a literary genius were
 actually the result of editor—author collaboration, or hard-fought compro-
 mise, or perhaps began with an editorial commission.’ A critical under-
 standing of the marketing of best-sellers, book prizes and cinema tie-ins can
 help us understand the way in which cultural artefacts are created and
 manipulated.
  At its most prosaic, however, the history of the book is just another
 module (or course of study, or programme) appearing on the curriculum
 of a school, college or university and presenting learners with the possibility
 of incorporating its subject matter into their education. Such a listing could
 be intriguing, but it might also be confusing. The book: what kind of history
 is that? What country or time period, or which national literature, does it
 cover? How will the materials and the assignments involved relate to my
 earlier experiences of studying and learning? Is this for me? Sometimes
 the initial response will be one of engaged curiosity. In other cases,
 though, students may question the relevance of studying the history of
 an object which has, after all, been declared dead, and one about which
 their own parents, friends and teachers may have strong opinions, strongly
 expressed.
  In other words, the history of the book comes with a good deal of
 cultural baggage which has to be unpacked before the subject’s intellectual
 and pedagogical potential can be fully realized in the context of classroom
 encounters with material books, [and ] [with ] [the ] [scholarship ] [of ][book ] [histor- ]
 ians. Widespread propaganda about digitization and e-books, combined

        Unlearning what ‘everyone knows’ about the book in history
     At the end of 1999, the German printer Johannes Gutenberg was named
     ‘Man of the Millennium’ by Time Magazine, for his contributions to
     European civilization. For most people around that time, however, a sim-
     pler fact prevailed: Gutenberg had invented the printing press. To many
     European and North American adults who had grown up in the late twen-
      tieth and early twenty-first centuries, the celebration of Gutenberg’s
     achievement was entirely understandable. It made sense not only of the
      past, but of their own present day. The superstition-racked middle ages,
     where monks controlled knowledge and laboriously reproduced manu-
      scripts by hand, seemed to have ended abruptly. And modern, rational
     enlightened thought, widely circulating among open-minded thinkers and
     from them to avid readers and learners, appeared to have begun. A technol-
     ogy that felt at least as consequential as gunpowder, the compass or the
      internal combustion engine seemed to have changed the world. A new
     communication medium, remarkably analogous to the internet, demon-
      strated that even old words and phrases appeared to have taken on new
     meanings when they were repurposed in new formats. How could it be a
     coincidence that geographical innovation and religious reform, in the per-
     sons of Christopher Columbus and Martin Luther, had seized on this new
     media technology of the fifteenth century? Literacy itself seemed to have
     been enabled by this new technology to facilitate reading. Around 2,000
     writers, artists and thinkers were seizing upon the possibilities of a world
     wide web to express ideas that appeared to vibrate in unison with the
     technology in which they were expressed, and the millennium seemed to
     belong to Gutenberg. Although scholars have nuanced or disproved every
     aspect of this compelling story, it persists in the popular media and even in
     school and university textbooks. It is the task of the history of the book to
     displace the myth of print’s transformation of European culture, in favour
     of a narrative which is not only more accurate, but also much more relevant
      for our time.
      To unlearn the popular, compelling and fundamentally flawed history of
     the book, it is important for students to be persuaded to abandon some
     comfortable shibboleths:
       First, the technology of printing did not substitute textual stability for the
      instability of manuscripts by introducing the characteristics of fixity and
     accuracy — and hence did not change texts in a fundamental way so as to
     enable modern forms of knowledge and of literary authorship in Europe.
     This myth has been challenged by numerous scholars, but their counter-

  film or blockbuster novel will dispel the Gutenberg myth; instead, the task
 of doing so will remain among the chief objectives of the book-history
 curriculum.
   Second, the book — as understood historically — does not always take the
  iconic material form of a set of leaves made of paper printed on both sides,
 bound together along one edge and protected by a hard or soft cover.
 Technically known as the codex, what is familiarly called ‘the book’ is only
 one of many forms in use now and in the past. Books can be made of other
  materials, and their texts can take other forms. As for the history of the book, a
  definition in terms of the codex is even less satisfactory. The academic term is
 even more capacious than the generic one — book history is a way of thinking
 about how people have given material form to knowledge and stories, in the
  past and in our own time. Even within the short history of printing, book
  history embraces the study of periodicals, newspapers and ephemera as well as
  the bound codex volumes we now associate with the terminology.
  A third point is that the textual form of ‘the book’ includes more genres,
  literary forms and subject matters than most commentators seem to assume.
 Modern imaginations, shaped by European, North American or Australasian
 education systems, and reinforced by the experience of retail bookstores,
 often overlook the many other printed works on the market. One such is
 sacred books, whose historicity and commercial value can be overlooked
 because the authorship is attributed to divine and historic figures, so that to
  a superficial observer, the vagaries of the book trade seem to have had no
 place. Another is the use of the codex form for managing large amounts
 of information, in such genres as the telephone directory and the railway
 timetable.>
   Fourthly, the computer and internet combined have not managed to bring
 about the death of the book, any more than literary theory has literally caused
 that of the author. Like earlier technologies before them, these new ways of
 putting words in front of the eyes and minds of readers are unsettling. We do
 not yet know whether or not they are transformative.
  And finally, it will be necessary to unlearn the habit of characterizing one
 society or another’s means of communication in terms of a ‘print culture’
 without offering a deep knowledge of how printers (later publishers), and
 retail booksellers and their customers, actually operated and how they them-
 selves conceptualized what they were doing. Both writers and readers were
 connected with, and by, the books and periodicals they read — and so, more
 concretely, were the men and women of the book trades. But given our
 knowledge that the texts people [were ] [reading, ] [buying ] [and ] [selling, ] [writing ]

         Resources for teaching and learning the history of the book
     This chapter does not aim to prescribe how the history of the book should be
     taught, or to recount systematically how it is actually taught in particular
     classrooms.® Pedagogy varies too much for it to be practicable to do so,
     depending as it does upon the instructor’s or the institution’s definition of
     ‘book’ and their approach to its history. Book history is taught and studied in
      different ways in various nations and institutions, and differently again from
      the perspectives of several academic disciplines and interdisciplinary config-
      urations. Such practical matters as the instructor’s research period and
      specialty, or the availability of material resources, necessarily shape any
     given curriculum. Master classes, or concentrated, skill-dedicated workshops
      in a Rare Book School, will be different again. Rather, the purpose of this
     chapter is to acknowledge some of the challenges inherent in the enterprise, to
      offer some ideas about what the learning objectives of such courses, modules
      or workshops might include and to discuss some possible kinds of resources
     and approaches.
      An undergraduate course, or degree, in English does not prepare the holder
      to work as a qualified literary critic, and nor do a few courses in history
     comprise the education of an archival researcher. Further, professional, train-
     ing is needed, but the initial degree does prepare its holder to be a good citizen
     and a well-rounded person. The same is true of the history of the book. Many
      of the skills of book historians are specialized, and cannot possibly be taught
      in a period of three or four months (or six or eight months) to undergraduates
      in a conventional curriculum. For some bibliographical research, such skills
      as paleography, diplomatics and collation are indispensable, but difficult to
     acquire. However it is possible to gain a broad appreciation of the history of
      the book, and even of some of its more esoteric knowledge, without aspiring
      to be an expert. Despite the importance of materiality to the field of study, the
      intellectual skills associated with book history can be taught without recourse
      to any specialized materials at all. The conventional methods of reading,
     thinking, discussing and responding in writing are as applicable to this as to
     any other subject, and need not even be framed as ‘book history’. A course in
     American literature, for example, could fruitfully draw upon numerous arti-
      cles and chapters, and use Ronald J. Zboray and Mary Saracino Zboray’s
     Literary Dollars and Social Sense: A People’s History of the Mass Market
     Book (2005) for the background.
       For a course in the interdisciplinary history of the book, however, a set of
     introductory chapters or readings (such as the ones in this volume) can sketch
      a useful chronology and introduce broad general concepts. A number of

 point, the instructor is in a position to add more specialized readings, which
 can be connected to research assignments. Every instructor will have his or
 her own preferred books and articles, the ones that feel comfortably teach-
 able. From a learner’s point of view, selected readings should address issues
 that reiterate the objectives of the course in such a way that the experience
 makes sense as a whole. For example, an opportunity might be provided to
 read and review a scholarly monograph whose subject is a single powerful
 book. Each work of this kind offers its own narrative of production and
 reception, so that the general message of book history is reinforced by the
 specific instance. Examples include James Secord’s Victorian Sensation: The
 Extraordinary Publication, Reception, and Secret Authorship of Vestiges of
 the Natural History of Creation (2000) and Patricia Coit Murphy’s What
 A Book Can Do: The Publication and Reception of Silent Spring (2005). Such
 works tell a graphic story about more than the intellectual, political and social
 impact of a work; they also recount and analyse its authorship, publishing
 and reading.
   In some institutional settings, there is room for creative and exploratory
 approaches to teaching the history of the book, even without invoking
 specialized techniques or inaccessible materials. An instructor who has intro-
 duced a chronological and thematic outline of the general tenets of book
 history could branch out by assigning students to read ‘bibliofictions’ — novels
 where the materiality and the mingled cultural and commercial nature of
 books are intrinsic to the plot. The students are assigned to read books about
 books, but this time fictions rather than histories. Geraldine Brooks’s People
 of the Book (2008) is only one of dozens of examples. This approach could
 easily be made multimedia by incorporating excerpts from films (Jean-
 Jacques Annaud’s 1986 The Name of the Rose or 84 Charing Cross Road,
 directed by David Jones in 1986) and television (Dylan Moran’s and Graham
 Linehan’s Black Books, broadcast in Britain 2000-4). The examples offered
 here are intentionally popular and accessible, but the approach could be
 varied to draw out the bibliographical themes in canonical literature
 (Gissing’s New Grub Street is but one example). Tests and assignments
 would demonstrate to what extent students had understood the real-life
 themes underlying various fictional treatments.
  Paradoxically, one of the best places to study the history of books in depth
 may be the internet. Students accustomed to hearing some teachers’ disdain for

     demonstrating the diversity of certain books — along with their beauty, their
     complexity and something of their history. Two of the earliest such projects,
      those addressing themselves to the multimedia artists William Blake and Dante
      Gabriel Rossetti, have designated themselves as ‘hypermedia archives’. Online
      resources can also be used to illustrate bindings, page designs and other features
      of rare books in special collections around the world, as well as to demonstrate
     how a hand press works, or how type is set in a composing stick.
      Assignments can be devised to make pedagogical use of an institutional
      library’s subscriptions to online research databases, and also to deal with the
      inevitable limitations of students’ knowledge. Students often find themselves
     thwarted when asked to take advantage of the rich range of online resources
      for studying the history of the book, only to discover that their particular
      question remains unanswered by scholars, or is too complex to tackle within
      the limits of an assignment. They may not know that considerable knowledge
      exists only in scholarly monographs and printed reference works. They may
       still be uncertain about what the subject entails, or lack the background
     knowledge necessary to identify a personal interest. One answer to this
      situation is for the instructor to construct a set of assignments, with print
     and digital materials packaged expressly to provide an experience of reading
      texts and images in their original form (or a digitized version of that form),
      but with the primary materials supported by appropriate secondary and
      tertiary sources.
       Despite the range of materials available for learning about the history of
     books by reading about it, however, an education in the subject should
     always include some opportunity for students to get their hands on some
     genuinely old and rare books. Any librarian who has an interest in special
      collections and rarities is a natural collaborator for the instructor in a course
      in the history of books. In many institutions, library and information profes-
      sionals are keen to become involved in the pedagogical project, and embrace
      the opportunity to participate in the teaching of book history classes. Their
      contribution will probably take place inside the library, of course, where
      students’ encounters with their bibliographical heritage can be carefully
     monitored even while being kindled. The instructor can circumvent this
      necessary limitation, however, if he or she has a small budget for purchasing
      a few copies of old — but not rare or valuable — books for classroom purposes.
     The opportunity to dissect a book has been documented by a number of
      classes as among the most memorable aspects of their education.” The lessons
      that some old books are not rare, and can be ripped apart in the interests of
      learning (and conversely that some rare books are not old and must be
     preserved in the interests of future scholarship) are some of the most impor-

   The librarian is not the only potential collaborator for the teacher of book
  history. Historians often find teaching partners in the English department,
  while professors of English literature have been known to discover a shared
  interest in the material book among their colleagues who teach French or
  Italian studies. Nor should instructors limit their search for colleagues to their
  own campus. A community where institutions of higher learning lack a biblio-
  graphical press can probably find a local craft printer, bookbinder, marbler or
  papermaker willing to offer a guest lecture, or to receive student visits and
  entertain questions. Local antiquarian and second-hand booksellers are not
  only a fount of knowledge, but also the purveyors of inexpensive books for
  student projects. A small press publisher, a freelance editor or a local bookseller
  might be pleased to give an occasional lecture. Book collectors are another set
  of extraordinarily well-informed book people, and many of them are generous
  and anxious to pass some of their knowledge on to a younger generation.
 Among visual artists, the ‘Book Arts’, which currently flourish among practi-
  tioners attuned to the changing role of media in their own work, offer another
  source of expertise which can be shared with students.
   Perhaps the ideal collaborator — or indeed instructor — for the history of
  books is a handpress printer oriented to pedagogy and managing a biblio-
  graphical press. The lesson that the book is an object which is also a text is one
  that can be learned by the body, as the learner sets up a text on a typogra-
  pher’s composing stick and pulls the bar of the platen press or the handle of
  the cylinder proofing press to create an object in multiple copies. The oppor-
  tunity to learn the rudiments of the printer’s craft in practice is to be found in
  only a handful of universities and libraries. Printer and scholar Noel Waite
  notes that ‘In the 1960s several “bibliographical” presses were established by
  those wishing, among other things, to teach the methods of textual transmis-
  sion in the medium of print as practised in the handpress era. Although these
  presses were attached to institutions of learning, they were run by enthusiasts,
  whose productions went beyond the call of duty’. A bibliographical press has
  been further defined as ‘a workshop or laboratory which is carried on chiefly
  for the purpose of demonstrating and investigating the printing techniques of
  the past by means of setting type by hand, and of printing from it on a simple
  press’.® This kind of press might print everything from facsimile pamphlets to
 wedding invitations, but its purpose is pedagogical, not commercial. The
  university or library where a bibliographical press is installed has a valuable
  experience to offer students, one well worth the necessity for employing a
  competent printer and making room for the equipment and supplies.

     handling books leads to a sensory and emotional understanding that does not
     occur in many other fields of study. The rigorously scholarly instructor will,
     no doubt, aim to keep the study of the book and its history on an austerely
     academic and even scientific level. But it is impossible to deny altogether the
     ineffable, almost spiritual dimension that pervades the study of books and
     periodicals in past and present cultures. It is a routine occurrence in the
     classroom for a few students to feel very strongly indeed about their visit to
     the special collection library, or their opportunity to pull on the bar of an iron
     press. There is a tactile aspect to the history of the book that seems to connect
     directly to human emotions. The materiality of a written document surviving
     from the past is one element. The fact that this material object carries a written
     text laden with meaning is another, especially when the student can see how
     that meaning is molded and enhanced by the tactile and emotional responses
     the materiality creates. Feeling the way the ink bites into the page of an early
     printed book to create a three-dimensional entity; transcribing a reader’s
     marginal notes and connecting them to a fuller knowledge of the life of that
     reader’s mind; smelling the scent of a freshly printed book or one that has
     been handled for centuries. These kinds of sensory experiences and aesthetic
     responses can be called forth by other objects, but they are particularly
     powerful when evoked by the text-bearing objects we call books. It is not
     necessary for the student of the history of the book to experience this emo-
     tional reaction, but it is important for the teacher to anticipate it.
      While the sensory experience of learning about old books is often intense,
      so is the intellectual engagement that comes with thinking abstractly about
     how they work. The history of the book has a theoretical component, and a
     course of study directly focused on that history will have to decide when, and
     how, to introduce such ideas as Robert Darnton’s ‘communication circuit’,
     D. F. McKenzie’s ‘sociology of texts’, Pierre Bourdieu’s ‘literary field’ and
     Benedict Anderson’s ‘print capitalism’. The extent to which students are
     required to engage with these ideas will depend upon their disciplinary back-
     ground and their level of study. Some instructors will choose to introduce
     these concepts at the beginning of a course, in order to frame the ideas that are
      to be inculcated. Others will wait until later in the semester, once a chronol-
     ogy or trajectory of ‘the book’ through history has been established, some
     virtual or hands-on processes experienced, and some exemplary scholarship
     read and analysed. Both are possible, but it might be most useful to introduce
     some of these ideas in two stages, initially as straightforward models, and
     then again midway through the course, this time as concepts which can be
     undermined when tested in the real world of book-historical research. The
     important thing to stress is that each of these concepts comes with its own

```

```
  later, none of the theoretical approaches should be taught as a rigid model.
 No model has yet been introduced that can explain everything we need to
 know about the book in social, economic and cultural context. Indeed the
  student who has learned to think in terms of one or other of these models may
  have to unlearn that way of thinking, in order to accommodate something
  more theoretically capacious. If the history of the book can make the ambi-
  tious claims discussed above, in various disciplines and interdisciplinary
  settings, then a vigorous debate over theoretical approaches is inevitable
  and necessary.
   One approach to introducing students to the cut-and-thrust of debate
  within the history of the book is to set up assignments where scholars’ work
  is paired with that of their critics. Two examples will suffice. The collabora-
  tors who were among the founders of the history of the book, Lucien Febvre
  and Henri-Jean Martin, suggested that, if other calculations were correct,
  ‘then about 20 million books were printed before 1500” (that is during the
  fifty or so years of the incunabula period in Europe). This statistic was
  reproduced without qualification by Benedict Anderson, who used it as the
  basis for a political interpretation of the impact of print. It will be salutary for
  students to learn how that figure has been systematically disproved by Joseph
  Dane. Another such exercise is provided by Elizabeth Eisenstein’s The
  Printing Revolution in Early Modern Europe, which offers an inspirational
  and engaging argument — until it is challenged by a reading of Adrian Johns,
 whose The Nature of the Book initiated its own equally powerful analysis by
  qualifying Eisenstein’s.?
         History of the book in the college or university
 While there are numerous stand-alone courses in the history of the book, at
  schools and universities around the world, there are only a few fully fledged
  degree-granting programmes. Because of book history’s inherent interdisci-
  plinarity, such programmes normally draw on resources from across the
  institution, even though they might be located in a single faculty or depart-
  ment. While the approach can be strictly theoretical, in some institutions
  students are offered practical training in publishing studies, book science or
 book studies. Here the teaching programme is oriented to employment in
  practice-based or vocational trades, with the historical and theoretical com-
 ponent serving in a supporting role and instructors valued for their real-world
  expertise. In more academic settings, however, the study of the book presents
  itself as an interdisciplinary or cross-disciplinary arrangement, a formal or

     undergraduate, is typically a degree in English, library and information
     studies or another discipline, with a certificate or acknowledgement of con-
     centration in the field. Holding a Master’s degree with this kind of endorse-
     ment enhances the student’s profile in applications to competitive doctoral
    programmes where bibliographical and book-historical knowledge are
     prized.
      The history of the book has made significant and well-recognized contribu-
     tions to studies in the history of science, as the work of Ann Blair, Adrian
     Johns, James Secord and others attests. A course of study for science majors,
     organized around the history and practice of scientific communication, can
     provide students with a valuable orientation to aspects of their own disci-
     pline. It could also serve as a meaningful way to fulfil the typical ‘breadth’
     requirement for sampling the humanities or social sciences. At the teaching
     level, scholars in book history working within an arts, humanities or social
     science faculty might find unexpected collaborators among professors of
     science or engineering, in the shape of aficionados of the history of science
     and technology, willing and able to share their knowledge, expertise and
     book collections.
      Here is another learning objective for studies in the history of the book:
     critical thinking and research skills. In the syllabus of most programmes in
     both humanities and social sciences, the study of critical reading and research
     methodology looms large. Students must be introduced to the concept that
     each secondary source they use is not only a piece of analysis and narrative
     but also part of an ongoing scholarly conversation, and that ideas and
     interpretations build upon the theory and practice of earlier scholars. At the
     same time, students are introduced to the methods of research, the use of
     printed books in the library, and (in some disciplines) of manuscript sources
     in the archive. Some instructors find it useful to incorporate in this module an
     awareness of the material form of written artefacts from the past. Students
     who learn how to read the outside (as well as the inside) of a book can
     recognize the names of publishers, identify whether a work is aimed at an
     academic or a popular readership, distinguish a textbook from a monograph
     and so forth. All these skills, essentially bibliographical, are crucial to appre-
     ciating academic writing. Similar exercises can extend to the reading of
     different scholarly genres, such as the website, the scholarly article or the
     book review.
      The university administrator with a budget to consider will be interested in
     offering book studies because they are attractive to learners from both prac-
      tical and intellectual perspectives, and such an administrator will be pleased
     to offer instructors an opportunity to teach their research specialty. But

  level, it may be difficult, expensive or even impossible to offer training in
  specialized skills. The history of the book is an attractive subject and (as this
  chapter has argued) one that can be made accessible to students who lack any
  prior awareness of it. Nevertheless there are times when very specialized
  knowledge is required, and that expertise is held by only a handful of scholars
  in the whole world. The answer, in this case, is to bring the students to the
  instructor for a short period of time, rather than put the instructor regularly
  in front of students but only in his or her own institution. The concept of a
  Rare Book School was initiated by the American rare-book librarian Terry
  Belanger, who hired a series of experts to teach five-day non-credit courses on
  subjects relating to the history of the book and rare-book librarianship.
  Belanger’s successors have developed variations on the basic concept which
  now flourish around the world.*° The demand for intensive summer courses,
  workshops and master classes is fuelled by the introductory courses which
  create a demand that non-specialist instructors cannot fill. The participants
  are not only academics, but also librarians, antiquarian booksellers, conser-
  vators and archivists, as well as enthusiastic amateurs. Rare Book Schools are
  also places where the relevant digital knowledge of the present generation is
  put into conversation with the bibliographical knowledge drawn from the
  recent past. This model is of particular importance as the skills of the biblio-
  grapher, and associated skills, are no longer routinely taught in institutions of
  higher learning. Practitioners and educators keep vital knowledge alive and
  pass it on to the next generation.
       The history of the book in the educated imagination
  The slick brochure, the plausible website, the over-hyped bestseller — each of
  these carries evidence inherent its own design. Not all of them are books, but
  each of them is nevertheless part of the history of the book. People who have
  studied that history know something their fellow-citizens don’t. It is possible,
  actually, to judge quite a lot about a book by its cover. And what has been
  learned about old books can be applied to new ones, as well as to other media
  both old and new. A chronologically oriented progression through the history
  of the book in various world cultures concludes, for most teachers and
  learners, with the subject’s application to contemporary media. In some
  cases there may be an extensive analysis of the publishing industry and its
  commercial and cultural practices. But even if their investigation has been
  limited to the past, students still take away an awareness of how books and
  texts are separate, but comingled; of how they change, with changing times

    compose them. It is useful to know, taking a well-known example, how badly
    Shakespeare’s plays were printed in his own time, and further distorted by
     printers throughout the following decades and centuries; how they have been
    disentangled with varying degrees of success by scholarship, including bib-
     liographical scholarship; how the plays became part of mass culture in the
    nineteenth century; and how they were incorporated into the twentieth-
    century schoolroom and the twenty-first-century media culture.** Even if
     the details are forgotten, the underlying message is not. Knowledge of the
     history of the book, conceptualized thus, is an essential component of what is
    sometimes called ‘media literacy’. Like the latter, it incorporates concepts of
     critical thinking, identification of bias and recognition of how commercial
     interests intersect with political and cultural representations.
      Unlike a media literacy oriented primarily to the ‘new’ and inherently visual
    media of internet and television, however, the history of the book inculcates
     an attitude of scepticism towards the myth of a solitary authorial genius. That
    myth is the notion that Shakespeare or Newton, Dickens or Darwin, was the
     sole source of the world-changing ideas that were, and continue to be,
    published under that author’s name. The myth rests on the fact that knowl-
    edge or artistry can have such a powerful effect on the human intellect and
     imagination that they seem to exist in an unmediated trajectory between the
     ‘genius’ author’s mind and the experience of the reader. The gatekeeping
    agency of publishers, the textual intervention of printers and editors, the
    collaboration of spouses and colleagues, the typographical and spatial mes-
     sages created by book designers — all these and more are invisible, except to
     the trained eye of research. Not only that. Since the seventeenth century at
     least, books and periodicals have been designed consciously to promulgate
     this myth of authorial authority, to create the effect that the book is a work of
     literary, scholarly or scientific brilliance. Undermining the myth of the solitary
     scientific genius has been the work of historians of science, who have shown
     that the inventions and discoveries of the past were only possible in the
     context of other kinds of knowledge in circulation at the time, and were
     inherently collaborative. The unsung work of laboratory assistants is being
     recognized, along with that of the printers and publishers who also, quite
     consciously, acted to present certain figures as lone inventors.
     One of the dominant conversations of our own time is the one about the
    imminent death of the book and the obsolescence of libraries. The producers
     of various kinds of electronic devices designed chiefly for leisure reading want
     their product and service to be the dominant model. But so did the proprietors
     of circulating libraries in the nineteenth century. The providers of databases
    and digital texts to public and research libraries, similarly and understand-

  the manufacturers of microfilm, only a few decades ago. The educated person
  who knows a bit about how books (and other media) travel and transform,
  and hence that it is not technology, but human choices, behind the changes
  that take place, is armed with the ability to read the message of the material
  form. She or he will not be persuaded by apocalyptic statements, and will
  know how to value the library as a cultural institution that survives and
  flourishes by changing, along with the books it collects.

         GLOSSARY OF TECHNICAL TERMS USED BY
       BIBLIOGRAPHERS AND HISTORIANS OF THE BOOK
    Scholarship in the history of the book often uses specialized terminology. This
    glossary is intended to help newcomers to interpret what they are reading, by
    providing brief definitions of such terms. However it is important to note that
    much more extensive definitions are available. A standard work on the subject
     is ABC for Book Collectors (by John Carter, revised edition published by Oak
    Knoll Press, 1995 and also available online). Many of the entries below consist
     of quotations from the Oxford Companion to the Book (Oxford University
     Press, 2010), abbreviated as OCB. See volume 1 of OCB for a list of editors and
     contributors of individual entries.
    alphabet, printer’s Defined by OCB as a ‘set of types kept in upper case, lower
      case and small capitals within a fount. It originally excluded j (represented
     by i), u (represented by v), and w (represented by vv), but included accented
      letters and ligatures’.
    bibliography, analytical Described by OCB as ‘the practice of reconstructing
      the physical processes by which printed books came to be produced’.
    bibliography, descriptive Described by OCB as being ‘concerned with books
      as material objects [but unlike analytical bibliography having] the single
      goal of describing the physical structure of books in a clear and concise
     way.
    bibliography, enumerative Its ‘basic function’ as described by OCB is ‘to list
      all titles of books that fall within specified parameters: geographic, linguis-
       tic, chronological, thematic or some combination thereof’.
    bibliography, historical OCB: “as a term it has been displaced by “history of
      the book” or histoire du livre’.
    bibliography, textual OCB: ‘any bibliographical endeavor that attempts to
      reconstruct the transmission of texts, with the possible goal of establishing
      or editing a specific work’.
    Book of Hours A prayer book in the Christian tradition, organized around

 bookplate A label (usually printed) to be attached inside a book as a record of
  ownership.
 bookseller A retail bookseller sells copies of books; until around 1800 in
   Britain and America the term ‘bookseller’ referred to an entrepreneur
  who undertook the functions now described as ‘publishing’. See also
   ‘stationer’.
 broadsheet A newspaper with large folded sheets; larger than a ‘tabloid’ and
   in journalism terms expected to be taken more seriously.
 broadside A sheet of paper printed on one side and publicly posted as a notice.
 codex Defined by OCB as ‘a book made from hinged leaves, in contrast to a
   roll (or scroll)’; these came into use in Europe between the second and
  fourth centuries CE.
 codicology The study of the text and materials making up a manuscript codex
   (as opposed to the scroll or roll).
 collation A complex term used in bibliography, but also referring to processes
  taking place in the printing house. Refers to the correct ordering and
  orientation of gatherings of printed sheets.
 communication(s) circuit Theoretical concept proposed by Robert Darnton
   in 1982 as a model of the ways in which a written text moves from author
   to publisher (plus editor and others) to printer (and binder and other
  production workers) to shipper to bookseller and on to the reader; the
   circuit is completed when the reader becomes an author.
 diplomatics (or diplomatic) Defined by OCB as: ‘the study of the authenticity,
  provenance and effects of such documents as legal records, charters,
  decrees, property deeds, accounts, registers, or any such historical docu-
  ments of interest’.
 Duodecimo: 12° or 12mo Defined by OCB as ‘format ... whereby a sheet
   is folded either twice across the longer side and thrice across the shorter,
   or (“long 12mo”) once across the shorter side and five times across the
  longer, producing a gathering of twelve leaves’. See also ‘format’, ‘leaf? and
   ‘sheet’.
 edition Defined by OCB as ‘the total number of copies of a book printed, at
  any time, from substantially the same setting of type ... The identification
  of different editions requires specialized bibliographical analysis and close
  examination of the differences between copies ... With the advent of
  automated printing techniques in the machine-press period, the longevity
  of an edition has greatly expanded’.
 edition binding Defined by OCB as ‘the issuing of whole editions of books, or
  significant portions of them, [in ][identical ] [bindings ] [as ] [part ] [of ][the ][publication ]

     folio or 20 Defined by OCB as ‘format whereby a sheet is folded once across
      the longer side, giving two leaves (four pages)’. See also ‘format’, ‘leaf’ and
       ‘sheet’.
     format According to OCB: ‘Often used in a generic fashion to describe the
       size and appearance of a book, “format” is the technical and bibliographi-
       cal term for the shape of the book, defined by the number of times each
      sheet has been folded’.
     forme Defined by OCB as ‘the chase and its contents (type, blocks, etc.)
      prepared for printing’. The chase is the ‘solid frame of wood or (more
     commonly) iron into which the type and other matter making up a forme
       are locked’.
     fount (font) Defined by OCB as ‘type acquired or consistently used as a single
      entity: letterpress and most bit-mapped founts generate one size, film or
      outline founts a range of sizes ... Founts are products, while typefaces are
      abstractions: one produces, sells, buys and downloads founts, but designs
      (and sells rights to) typefaces’.
     gathering Defined by OCB as ‘a group of one or more conjugate leaves sewn
      together before binding. Depending on format, a gathering is made from
      one folded sheet, from a fraction of a sheet, or from several folded sheets
      tucked one inside another (i.e. quired)’.
     impression Defined by OCB as “all copies of an edition printed at any one
      time’ and also as ‘the art or process (“taking an impression”) or the quality
      (a “good”, “bad”, “light” or “heavy impression”) of printing, usually
       letterpress’.
     imprint Identification of the person(s) responsible for producing a printed
      book, usually giving place of publication, name of publisher and date of
      publication.
     incunable (plural: incunabula) A book printed with moveable type, in
      Europe, between the mid-1450s and r5o1. The term refers to the ‘cradle’
      and hence to the earliest experiments with the new technology.
     leaf Defined by OCB as a ‘double-sided piece of paper, parchment or similar
      material capable of being written or printed on, comprising two pages,
      recto and verso’.
     legal deposit Defined by OCB as ‘a statutory obligation on publishers to
      deposit in designated libraries a copy of each publication’.
     letterpress OCB defines this as ‘a term used by scholars and the trade,
      equivalent to relief. As a noun, “letterpress” means relief, rather than
      intaglio or planographic, printing; as an adjective, it modifies “machines”
      (letterpress machines are for relief printing), “plates” (letterpress plates
      print relief) or output (letterpress text means printed by type)’.

 metadata Data about data — such as the information in a library catalogue
  record which identifies a book or article.
 MS (plural MSS) Abbreviation for ‘manuscript(s)’ often used in citations
  referring to archival or library collections.
 Octavo: 8° or 8vo Defined by OCB as ‘format whereby a sheet is folded
  thrice, giving eight leaves (sixteen pages)’. See also ‘format’, ‘leaf’? and
   ‘sheet’.
 offset printing OCB: ‘Unlike printing directly from an inked surface, offset
  printing is indirect. The inked surface delivers its ink to a second surface,
  which in turn transfers the ink to the third and final surface, usually
  paper ... Its practical application has been for lithography’.
 paleography Defined by OCB as ‘the study of the handwriting of previous
  centuries ... [The] paleographer teaches both how to read the text and how
   to interpret the MS’.
 plate Defined by OCB as ‘a printing surface, usually made of one solid piece,
  rather than a set of individual components that have been forced together
  (such as a forme of type)’. Also refers to ‘a leaf that is not integral to a
  gathering, but is printed separately and added when gathering ... [M]Jost
  plates are illustrations’.
 Quarto: 4° or 4to Defined by OCB as ‘format whereby a sheet is folded twice,
  giving four squarish leaves (eight pages)’. See also ‘format’, ‘leaf’? and
   ‘sheet’.
 recto Defined by OCB as ‘front side of a single leaf or right-hand page of an
  opening in a codex’.
 serial A periodical publication. But ‘serialization’ refers (per OCB) ‘to
  the practice of dividing longer works for inclusion in newspapers or
  magazines, or publishing them separately as parts, issued over a long
  period’.
 sheet Defined by OCB as ‘the printer’s unit of paper, manufactured in various
   sizes, weights and qualities. A sheet in the handpress period printed two
  folio leaves, four quarto leaves, eight octavo and so forth ... Sheets were
  sold in quires and reams, with a ream comprising twenty quires of 24 or 25
  sheets each’.
 signature Defined by OCB as ‘alpha-numeric indicator for the binder of the
  gathering and its bifolia (“pairs of conjugate leaves joined at a central
  fold”) — and of the gathering’s [place ] [in ] [the ] [sequence ] [of ] [gatherings’. ]
  However the term is often used [informally ] [to ] [refer ] [to ] [a ] [folded ] [sheet ] [or ] [set ]
  of sheets.

         _ this Companion provides a wide-ranging account of the history of the book and its ways
          Pa f of thinking about works from ancient inscription to contemporary e-books, discussing
         thematic, chronological and methodological aspects of this interdisciplinary field. The
          first part considers book cultures from local, national and global perspectives. Part two,
       organized around the dynamic relationship between. the material book and the mutable text,
        develops a loosely chronological narrative from early writing, through manuscript and
        early printing, to the institution of a mechanized book trade, and on to the globalization
         of publishing and the introduction of the electronic book: A third part takes a practical
           turn, discussing methods, sources and approaches: bibliographical, archival and
             reading experience methodologies, as well as pedagogical strategies.
