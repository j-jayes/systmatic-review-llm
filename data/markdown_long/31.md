###### Preface

 This book is not a history of the CAW, but an essay on that history. My goal

is not to be comprehensive in the sense of documenting every strike and
struggle, but to address and develop questions and themes that are relevant
###### to the union in the present, and are likely to continue to be relevant in the
future.

###### The Canadian section of the UAW emerged in the 1930s. The break¬ through came after the twenties, a decade when trade unionism seemed to have lost its dynamism, and during a period when capitalism itself seemed to have exhausted its potential. The birth of the union in Canada was very much inspired by the struggles of American workers, and the Americans generally continued to play a leading role in our relationship with them
over the next forty-five years.

Yet in the mid-eighties, the Canadians suddenly decided to break from
###### the Americans and establish their own union. What accounted for that Canadian change of heart and mind? Was it as sudden as it seemed? How
did the Canadians develop the confidence to go off on their own, especially
###### at a time when the economic and political elite were pushing the Canadian economy towards greater integration with the U.S.? What further changes
did the creation of a new Canadian union demand? These questions cannot
be addressed without considering the history of the union and its changing
culture: how the union operated, how it saw itself, how it addressed its limits
###### and goals.
 This focus on the breakaway in 1985 meant a concentration on the tra¬ ditional section of the union: heavy manufacturing in central Canada. But
just as the Canadian UAW was transformed over time into the CAW, the
###### union was transformed again by the mergers, new organizing, and changes it
faced in the decade after 1985. I have not dealt in detail with the wide
range of histories and rich experiences that came with the new groups for
###### the obvious reason that doing them justice would have required a level of research and familiarization that wasn’t possible within the time limits this

book faced.


-----

I hope that CAW members and others who open this book will find it
###### informative and interesting, but above all that it will stimulate them to
develop their own local and union histories and challenge them to think
more self-consciously about their individual responsibilities in building the
###### union and shaping history. History helps us to understand how things hap¬
pened and why. But that understanding is only a base for addressing how we
can participate in determining what happens next.

Like all books, this one was completed only because of the support and
help of others who considered the project worth doing. Buzz Hargrove and
Jimmy O’Neil not only encouraged me to start it, but kept it going by refus¬
ing to accept any arguments I made for postponing it. My friends and co¬
workers in research services picked up, with no complaints, the slack while I
was gone. Nick Saul assisted with some of the research and was a ready
sounding board. Nancy Kearnan, who works with me as a secretary, passed
decisive judgement — as she’s been doing on my writing for fifteen years —
###### on the book’s relevance and readability. Kathy Bennett, the CAW librarian,
was always ready with useful archival advice and found things, it often
seemed, before I had finished asking for them. And Ron Dickson, who just

by being there shared his quiet dignity with us, also agreed to share some of
his poetry in the pages of the book. The Centre for Work and Society at

York University provided me with an office I could hide in, away from dis¬
tractions.

###### A number of people read through sections of the manuscript and offered,
sometimes quite detailed, suggestions: Charlotte Yates, who also generously
loaned me her index file on fifty years of UAW/CAW-related articles in the
Globe and Mail; David Sobel, who also helped with photographs and whose
passion for history is infectious; Craig Heron, whose own work is a model of
###### both working class sympathies and historical integrity; Herman Rosenfeld,
whose energy and intellectual curiosity, while sometimes exhausting, is
###### something we need more of; and Leo Panitch, with whom I long lost the ability to distinguish which ideas were mine and which were his. Eileen
Koyama suffered through the often tedious work of copy-editing, and was
extremely helpful.

###### Jonah, my older son, gave me another troubling perspective on history by
surpassing me in height while I wrote this book. Lucas, my younger son, is
already working on a CD-ROM of the book with animation and an original
musical score. If I said that Schuster — my friend, partner, and the real
writer in the family “admirably patient ” anyone who ever called me

###### at home would raise an eyebrow; my credibility would be gone before they
got to the book itself. Schus and the kids harassed me enough to keep me in
###### touch with the immediate world, but also understood that what I was doing
was important enough to complete. They maintained my sanity and have,
for so many years now, kept me going.

Two historic events marked 1985: the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of
###### the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) and the formal breakaway of the Canadian section of the United Automobile Workers (UAW) to

form its own union.

###### Linking Two Stories

 The first event, the emergence of the CIO in the mid-1930s, was a response
to the failure of the existing labour movement to deal with a critical new
###### development within capitalism. National and international corporations,
organized on a multiplant basis, had come to dominate rapidly growing and
###### increasingly important mass production industries such as auto, rubber,
electrical, and steel. These powerful corporations were revolutionizing the
organization of the workplace, the economy, and society. But the main form
of trade unionism at that time, craft unionism, was incapable of dealing
with the new challenge.

###### Craft unionism had emerged in the mid-1800s, when skilled workers
came together to form the first significant and lasting unions in Canada.
###### These unions established a sense of mutual aid and pride in manual labour,
and in the early 1870s, they engaged in a historically crucial fight for the
###### nine-hour day. Although unsuccessful, this struggle established links across communities in southern Ontario and Montreal and thereby represented the first stage in the establishment of a Canadian labour movement.
 This form of unionism organized workers according to their specific
skills; for example, a toolmaker belonged to one union and a pipefitter to
###### another, even if both were in the same workplace. But more important,
craft unionism was exclusive. It limited itself only to skilled workers and
essentially ignored the rest of the workforce — what one Teamster official
of the time called “the riff-raff.” Industrial unionism, by contrast, welcomed
all workers in any particular workplace, across national companies, and
###### even attempted to bring workers within entire sectors into one organiza¬ tion. This type of unionism was democratic and universal, reaching out
beyond skill level, gender, colour, and accent.

###### Attempts to launch industrial unionism had been made in earlier
decades, by the Knights of Labor in the last quarter of the 1800s and by the
Industrial Workers of the World (IWW or “Wobblies”) in the decade before

###### tries were not only joining unions, they
were also leading the way. Immortalized by a wave of sit-down strikes in the
###### American Mid-west, the spirit of the CIO inspired Canadian workers to
overcome their uncertainties and initiate direct action. As Irving Abella
phrased it in an article for the Canadian Historical Association, to Canadian
workers, “CIO was a magic name. Whenever they heard it, they flocked;
whoever used it they trusted.”

Five decades later, the split of the Canadian UAW from its parent orga¬
###### nization exposed an American failure and Canadian potential. By the early
1980s, it was clear that over the four decades since the CIO’s breakthrough,
###### American labour had failed to build a movement that could effectively
respond to the new era of restructuring and corporate aggressiveness. The
###### American leadership of the UAW chose to sell concessions, and their
demoralized membership acquiesced. The Canadian section of the union
rebelled, and that rebellion ultimately led to the formation of a new union
— that of the CAW (Canadian Auto Workers).

sweeping the Western world.

###### The Past as Present

 When we identify these events — the formation of the CIO and the forma¬ tion of the CAW — as “historic,” what do we really mean?
 At the most obvious level, we mean they were important. They had a crucial impact not only on the union, but also on the establishment of a Canadian working class and on broader developments such as the emer¬
gence of the welfare state and the nature of our politics. The formation of
###### these groups is therefore significant in terms of their relationship to the pre¬ sent, to the story of how we arrived where we are today.

future as much as the past. From this perspective, these two particular events

stories because they reveal and symbolize the potential of workers, not only
to be part of history, but also to take steps to collectively shape it.

From the early days of the emergence of a wage-earning class (stretch¬
ing back roughly two hundred years), working-class families fought against
the destruction of former values and methods; they opposed, resisted, rioted,
went on strike, and formed unions. But these protests were always fragment¬
ed. They occurred sporadically and on a regional rather than national basis.
###### In addition, they involved only particular sections of the working class. The
protests were defeated because, while they kept certain ideas alive, they were
unable to build the institutions and capacity required for a sustained response
to capitalism.

###### Industrial unionism held out the hope of finally creating that perma¬ nence and that capacity. The movement for industrial unionism called forth
a vision of a new kind of working class institution that was independent of
its bosses and that had enough staying power to win immediate demands,
move towards broader reforms, and possibly even transform society. This
###### movement was distinct in its scale, scope, and breadth: it reached out to all
workers, established a base in each workplace, and participated in other
movements emerging in the turmoil of the times.

###### The 1930s witnessed an upsurge in working class politics: workers’ study
groups were established; co-ops formed; alternative newspapers linked
themselves to a new readership; municipal elections saw independent farm
###### and/or labour candidates step forth; and new parties, such as the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) entered the national polit¬
ical arena. This upsurge awakened a new creativity amongst artists: litera¬
###### ture, plays, street theatre, posters, and especially songs reflected popular
struggles.

For a brief moment in the thirties and again immediately after the war,
working people were living and breathing one of those rare and glorious his¬
###### torical moments when so much seemed truly possible. It was a time when, with some exaggeration, but reflecting the growing public legitimacy of unions in the United States, union posters quoted the American president

as saying, “If I worked in a factory, the first thing I would do would be to
###### join a union.” It was a time when the American Senate actually passed —
even if it later sidetracked — a bill to establish a thirty-hour week, and polls
in the bastion of capitalism showed that forty-one per cent of the American
###### population supported nationalizing the banks. It was a time when the work¬

would overcome the dependency on their American “older brothers.” For

promise. That failure was linked both to changes in the economy and soci¬

ety, and to the concerted efforts of companies and governments to weaken
###### unions. But crucial to that story were decisions made and opportunities
ignored that were internal to the trade union movement: issues of democra¬

cy and bureaucratization; attitudes towards the independent role of unions
in the workplace and society; and responses to past successes and openness

members. That’s why these issues are so complex and why they currently
challenge unions on both sides of the border.

###### challenging the status quo and driving social change.
 Out of such challenges grew a culture of resistance and a legacy that, while sometimes faint, still swirls around the halls, meetings, and picket
lines of unions. The history of a trade union is about the creation of a vehi¬
cle through which working people can act to win immediate gains and
###### thereby build a collective memory — a culture of struggle — to be passed on to new activists and new generations.

 The history of the CAW falls naturally into four interrelated stories:

 Waiting

 The prehistory of the union: the crisis in the labour movement as it strug¬
gled directionless through the twenties and early thirties, and the challenge
of developing a new kind of unionism to give voice to workers in the emerg¬
ing mass production industries (Chapters 1-2).

###### The Union Arrives

 The establishment of the UAW in Canada and the U.S. as a stable and per¬ manent institution: the early breakthroughs, growth in numbers, acceptance
by both employers and the state, structural changes and innovative gains,
###### and the carving out of a permanent space within society as a progressive

social union (Chapters 3-5).

###### Limits

 The challenges to the institutionalization of the union: problems created by
its successes, the demands of a new generation of workers in the sixties, and
###### the counterattack by corporations and governments in the mid-seventies

 (Chapters 6-7).

###### Towards Movement Unionism

 The breakaway from the UAW: how and why the Canadians developed in a
different direction, the direct events leading to the split, and the subsequent
changes and problems in the creation of a new kind of union (Chapters
###### 8-10).

Unionization wasn’t established in the auto industry

until three decades after the first car factories were built

in Canada, and two decades after the introduction of

the assembly line. Part One deals with the immediate

background of the UAW’s birth: the development of the

auto industry and assembly line production (Chapter 1)

and the social and economic context of the Great

Depression (Chapter 2).

###### — Upton Sinclair


-----

###### The new mass production industries such as auto, rubber, and electronics, as
well as related older industries such as farm machinery and steel, settled in
###### southern Ontario. They concentrated there in response to earlier national
policy decisions, markets and population, and dependency on the American
manufacturing belt around the Great Lakes. The revival of unionism at this
particular time in Canadian history would depend on the success of industri¬
al unionism. Canadian unionism would therefore rise or fall with struggles
###### taking place in communities such as Windsor, Sarnia, Hamilton, St. Catharines, Brantford, London, Kitchener, and Oshawa. The key industry in
these southern Ontario communities was automobiles — an industry once
called “capitalism’s favourite child.”

###### Capitalism’s Favourite Child Comes to Canada

 The auto industry stood at the centre of the new stage of capitalism by
virtue of its relative size, dynamic growth, importance to other key sectors,
and revolutionary role in reorganizing production. By the depression, auto
###### comprised North America’s major manufacturing sector, and General Motors (GM) was the largest manufacturing company in the world. Productivity growth far exceeded the rate of other sectors. The industry
supported other key sectors, including steel, rubber, glass, and tool-and-die
###### production, and the assembly line had come to represent, in industry circles
and beyond, the ultimate in mass production techniques. After World War

I, automobiles became the symbol of a prosperous materialist culture that
affected our values and the structure of our lives. It was reflected in trans¬
###### portation systems, the development of cities and suburbs and changes in shopping habits, private versus collective space, recreation, and how we
measured personal success.

###### The auto industry was relatively new, emerging only at the beginning of the twentieth century. Through the next two decades, almost two hundred
companies attempted to become full-scale manufacturers in North America,
###### but by the early twenties, an on-going shake-out had left only two of these
firms in clearly dominant positions: GM and Ford. Chrysler joined them in
1925, and by the depression, the Big Three controlled over three-quarters of
###### the market. One reason for the rapid shake-out was the critical importance
of corporate size and product volume, especially after the introduction of the
assembly line in 1913 Another reason was the move in the mid-twenties to

marketing, and financing. Courtesy of Wayne State Archives.

###### Canada remained a player through this period not as a result of the free market, but in spite of

it. Given the American advantages of access to a large market and experi¬
###### ence in the design and manufacturing of cars, the free market would have
quickly decreed that we simply import our vehicles from the United States.
But jobs and our own industrial strategy demanded otherwise. The industry
###### remained in Canada as a result of conscious government intervention, by
way of tariff policy, to change the logic of the market. A tariff of thirty-five
per cent forced the manufacturers to at least assemble the vehicles and some
###### components in Canada.
 In addition to having its own market, Canada was the back door to the British Empire. Outside imports faced high tariffs in all countries of the empire, and this policy discouraged direct sales from the United States. These tariffs could, however, be circumvented by using one of the countries within the empire as a base, and that role fell to Canada. By the early twen¬
ties, Canada ranked second only to the U.S. in the production of vehicles (a
###### position Canada lost during the depression when protectionism within


-----

Europe pressured the auto companies to set up facilities overseas).

###### The companies exploited the tariff to keep prices high in Canada. Since the industry was concentrated in Ontario, there was, not surprisingly, pres¬
sure from the West to lower the tariff. In 1926, an innovative solution
emerged that would form the core of Canadian auto policy for the next six
decades: the tariffs would be lowered, with the precondition that companies
###### had to increase the level of Canadian content.
 Although initially opposed by the parts companies, this policy quickly increased the number of parts jobs in Canada. Imports of vehicles also
increased as some of the smaller assembly companies, unable to meet the
###### content requirements, closed their assembly plants and shipped from the United States. Overall, the number of auto jobs grew, doubling in the twen¬
ties to reach over 16,000 by 1929 (still only about three per cent of the
more than 500,000 auto jobs in the U.S.). In the Windsor area, the overall
###### population increased fivefold between 1904, when Ford began production there, and 1929.

 An Animated Tool of Management

 The auto industry had emerged out of the bicycle and carriage industry, which had been based in Michigan, Ohio, and southern Ontario. Production was in the hands of all-around mechanics who worked at fixed
stations to complete a single vehicle. At first, they moved around the work¬
place to retrieve parts and to change tools, but soon helpers were hired to
bring the tools and parts so that the skilled workers could spend “the compa¬

ny’s time” on what they did best. From the start, some specialization was
common; in a small group of workers making a car, each individual concen¬
###### trated on a different set of tasks.
 These skilled workers had a full conception of the car they were making; they performed a variety of tasks and used their initiative, skills, and imagi¬ nation to iron out problems as they occurred. They were, of course, pres¬
sured by supervisors, but the knowledge that resided in their hands and
minds limited their vulnerability to the employer. It was this knowledge that
###### management, by way of the assembly line, systematically tried to separate
from the workers and capture for the company.

###### The assembly line was the culmination of a series of innovations in

###### and now or components. A moving line passed in front of workers, each of
whom repeatedly performed a narrowly defined task that was part of a whole
###### conceived by others. Although the final assembly line accounted for only fif¬ teen to twenty per cent of the workforce, it drove the process, setting the
philosophy, direction, and goals of all operations.

ing their potential as productive “doers.” In

buying a set of tools or a machine. Workers could still limit the extent to

company. This capacity translated into a measure of power for workers and a

conflict over production pace

###### Editorial in International Molders Journal, 1918.

The one great asset of the wage worker has been his craftsmanship. We think of
craftsmanship ordinarily as the ability to manipulate skilfully the tools and
material of a craft or trade. But true craftsmanship is much more than this. The
really essential element in it is not manual skill and dexterity but something stored
up in the mind of the worker. This something is partly the intimate knowledge of
the character and uses of his tools, materials, and processes of the craft ... But
beyond this and above this, it is the knowledge which enables him to understand
and overcome the constantly arising difficulties that grow out of variations not
only in the tools and materials, but in the conditions under which work must be
done ...

... the greatest blow that could be delivered against unionism and the organized
worker would be the separation of craft knowledge from craft skill ... The first

[way this is done] is the introduction of machinery and the standardization of
tools, materials, product, and process which make production possible on a large
scale, and the specialization of the workmen. Each workman under such
circumstances needs and can exercise only a little craft knowledge and a little craft
skill. But he is still a craftsman, though only a narrow one and subject to much
competition from below.

The second, far more dangerous than the first is the gathering up of all scattered
craft knowledge, systemming it and concentrating it in the hands of the employer
and then doling it out again only in the form of minute instructions, giving to each
worker only the knowledge needed for the performance of a particular relatively
minute task ... When [this process] is completed, the worker is no longer a
craftsmen in any sense, but is an animated tool of the management.

... if we do not wish to see the American workmen reduced to a great semi-skilled
and perhaps little organized mass, a new mode of protection must be found for the
working conditions and standards of living which unions have secured and some
means must be discovered of giving back to the worker what he is fast losing in the
narrowing of his skill and theft of his craft knowledge ...

###### Henry Ford bragged that, in contrast to the former workplace, which

was dominated by skilled mechanics and their helpers, better than two of
every five workers could be trained within one day under the new system,
###### and an equal number could be trained within a week. For Ford, the dream

After all, he had three children. His pay was four francs seventy-five centimes an
hour. He wanted more. He wanted to buy a new bed. He even dreamt about a
new apartment: his window faced a blind courtyard, and his youngest daughter,
who was already four years old, still couldn’t walk. He had lots of dreams ...

It now took only fifty'five seconds to attach a shackk'plate. Now seventy chassis
moved past Pierre every hour. He still received the same four francs seventy'five

would come home, dismal and mindless. He was always silent. He seemed to
have forgotten how to talk. All he knew how to do was fasten a shackk'plate. In
fifty'five seconds. He would die five years ahead of time. But now each

###### Eliminating Discontent

 The first principle of labour relations for the major auto companies was to
keep unions out and force workers to confront the company as isolated indi¬
viduals. The dehumanization of the pace and content of work may have
made unionization more important than ever to autoworkers, but the imme¬
diate impact of the changes in production also made unionization extremely
difficult.

###### The trades had provided the foundations of unionism. Canada, as a late¬
comer to industrialization, was dependent on immigration for its workforce;
it had looked to countries such as England and Scotland for its trades. These
###### tradespeople brought with them better-developed union traditions and
socialist ideas. Even within Canada, recruitment of trades from other sectors
###### into auto often brought workers with union experience in other sectors. But
once the new system of auto production had cut the number of skilled work¬

ers to a minority of the workforce (less than fifteen per cent), the issue of
###### unionization clearly shifted to organizing the unskilled and semiskilled
workers.

###### Amongst the semiskilled workers were skilled trades, people whose work had been deskilled. Furthermore, the assembly line arrived somewhat later
in Canada than in the United States and the deskilling of jobs had not yet

logic of the assembly line dominat¬
ed the organization of production.
###### These unskilled workers came from
rural communities that had no previous exposure to unionism (mechaniza¬
###### tion and concentration were reducing the farm population and pushing
workers into industry). Or, the workers were immigrants from the British

Isles and Eastern Europe. Although these immigrants included workers with
socialist backgrounds and the tight ethnic communities became a base for
future unionization, radical changes required a cohesive movement which,
like the confidence to take on the companies, would take time to develop.

From the beginning, workers resisted the assembly line. Many individuals
simply quit: after the introduction of the assembly line in 1913, Ford had to
###### hire ten workers to get one who would not, very shortly, quit. By 1918, Ford
still had to hire over 55,000 workers to keep a workforce of 14,000. The rate
###### of turnover was also high for more senior workers especially if other jobs


-----

were available. This high turnover, along with the large number of workers
who viewed their employment as temporary (e.g., those who were saving for
a farm), made collective action through unionization more difficult.

###### The auto companies, led by Ford, paid relatively high wages. The great
increases in productivity as a result of assembly line production allowed for
###### both high wages and high profits. But high wages were also a response to the extraordinary turnover of workers and early unionization drives such as
those led by the IWW even before World War I. During these prosperous
times, the high wages attracted a steady stream of labour to the auto towns.
###### Henry Ford, in his autobiography, described his decision to stabilize his
workforce by raising wages as “one of the finest cost-cutting moves ever
made.”

###### The high wages didn’t necessarily translate into high income because of the cyclical nature of car sales and the introduction of annual model
changes in the late twenties. GM and Chrysler didn’t follow Ford’s wage sys¬
tem; they continued to use payment systems based not on work-time but on
###### output (piece rates and group bonuses). These systems required less supervi¬
sion since they exerted pressure on workers to police themselves. This pres¬
sure was especially high in the group bonus structure because any group
members who weren’t carrying their load directly lowered the bonus for all.

Higher wages were only one tactic the companies used to keep unions
out. The companies used every kind of coercion they had at their disposal
— or they could create — to keep unions from establishing a foothold in
###### the industry. The regular bouts of lay-offs, at a time when seniority was only

a distant dream, provided management with an enormous weapon to wield
###### against workers. This weapon was used to cast aside older workers, to

amongst the workers.

Yet even this structure of power was not enough for the companies in
###### their anti-union crusade. Ford’s crusade was supplemented by an internal “service” department of 3,000 thugs, spies, and enforcers. Chrysler employed the Corporations Auxiliary Company, a private anti-union
agency. General Motors’ strategy included coercion, but it also focused on
###### the lure of welfare schemes. The company’s paternalism included profit- sharing plans, sickness insurance, health benefits, dances, bands, company- financed mortgages (approximately three-quarters of Oshawa workers in the thirties had such mortgages) and, especially important, a broad range of
sports clubs.

###### Once unionization became a possibility, GM added an externally hired
spy system. In the U.S., the company employed at least fourteen private
###### detective agencies in the mid-1930s. The Pinkerton Detective Agency, which specialized in providing spies, agent provocateurs, and private anti¬ union armies, had GM as its largest customer. General Motors didn’t want a third party (a union) interfering with its operations, but was prepared to hire

as many third parties as it could to keep things that way. One of the sub¬
###### committees of the U.S. Senate, popularly known as the La Folette Civil
Rights Committee, was holding hearings in the mid-thirties on the corpo¬
###### rate spying against the unions. It characterized the contract between GM and Pinkerton’s as "... a monument to the most colossal super-system of spies
yet devised in any American company.”

###### In Canada, the role of spies is less documented, but auto companies often
employed the Corporations’ Auxiliary, an organization set up by employers
###### to infiltrate and undermine union organizing drives. The spies would name union activists, and the resultant firings and suspicions about who might be

a spy intimidated and demoralized workers.

During these years, the auto companies also intensified their demands on
###### the independent parts companies. At first, the auto makers were primarily involved in the design of the vehicle and the coordination of its assembly; they bought components from independent companies. Then, the majors began to consolidate internal parts production. This move strengthened their bargaining position with the suppliers: in addition to playing one pro¬ ducer off against another, the auto majors could also threaten to do the work
themselves. This new pressure on the parts companies led directly to inten¬

sified pressures on the wages of parts workers

###### The labor spy business was a big one in the 1930’s. The automobile companies were the best clients of the Pinkerton Agency and Corporations Auxiliary. Spies in the auto plants were instructed to report on every meeting and every casual conversation among workers about their grievances.

###### Stuck in Second Gear

 In spite of the risks, strikes did take place in auto during this difficult period,
and, on occasion, they were successful. The trades in particular, though now
a minority, had not completely lost their ability to shut down production.
Before World War I and in the twenties, there were a number of attempts at
###### forming industrial unions in auto, but these attempts were consistently undermined by the craft-based Trades and Labor Congress (TLC), which
refused to support these organizations, or expelled them as dual unions com-
###### peting in jurisdictions where unions already existed.
 Given the absence of a union base, the workers’ only strength lay in tight production schedules. Militancy, when it did occur, therefore tracked upturns in the business cycle. In 1928-29, the Canadian auto industry was at a peak. As a young industry, its potential was high, and it had grown
rapidly during the twenties. This growth was reinforced by a highway build'
ing program. In addition, not only was the economy and therefore Canadian
###### demand booming, but trade policy had increased Canada’s share of North American production. At the same time, however, competition for market
share was intensifying. With Ford in the midst of completing a major shut-
down and massive restructuring, the title of industry leader was up for grabs.
###### The smaller assemblers desperately tried to avoid the competitive crush of the giants.
 The result was that the companies were intensifying pressures on workers at the same point in time that the industry could accommodate a response
by workers. A rash of strikes erupted in 1928-29: GM in Oshawa; Chrysler
in Windsor; Willys-Overland in Toronto; Studebaker in Windsor; Canadian
Top and Body in Tilbury; Ford in Windsor; Dodge in Toronto; and again
###### GM in Oshawa. Most of these strikes lasted only a few hours, and although the cause was no doubt an accumulation of grievances, the dissatisfaction

was expressed through a focus on wages and methods of payment.

###### The most significant of these strikes was the first: the one-week strike in
Oshawa in March, 1928. This early strike attracted attention and excitement
amongst groups trying to organize autoworkers in Detroit. It began with the
walk-out of 400 trimmers — skilled workers who had experienced the steady
deskilling and downgrading of their work over the past decade, and whose
work allowed for some regular communication amongst themselves. General
Motors had enforced cuts in piece rates in 1927 and, in spite of record profits


-----

In the late 1920s Canadian labour was divided into four labour centrals:

1. The TLC, established in 1886, was based on craft unionism and was
dominated by its American counterpart, the American Federation of Labor.
2. The Canadian and Catholic Confederation of Labour in Quebec,
established in 1921, was closely linked to the church. It supported
cooperative class relations and fiercely opposed the politics and militancy
of emerging industrial unionism.
3. The AlLCanadian Congress of Labour was established in 1927 by a
combination of conservative unionists, nationalists, and communists.
###### What unified these groups was their opposition to the craft-based and
American-dominated unionism of the TLC.
4. The Workers Unity League (WUL) was established in 1928 after
Moscow pressured communists to set up their own labour centrals to lead a
more militant industrial unionism, strengthen links to unorganized and
unemployed workers, and work to transform (not just reform) the
capitalist system.

worked in the facility at the time) soon joined the walk-out, and the workers
were militant enough to both reject the strike committee’s recommendation
of independent arbitration and insist on union recognition.

###### Through the intervention of the TLC, workers eventually accepted the
company’s withdrawal of the cut in pay, went to arbitration, and established a
local linked to the TLC. The workers were not ready to join forces with the
smaller, less established, more radical labour central that was formed the pre¬
vious year — the All Canadian Congress of Labour (ACCL). The eventual
###### arbitration ruling was a bitter disappointment, and the union was generally
discredited. When 250 tool-and-die makers went on strike in March, 1929,
###### their efforts were defeated after two-and-a-half weeks. There were some departmental strikes at GM in 1930 and 1932, but they were isolated events.
 The communist-led Automobile Workers’ Industrial Union (AWIU) had been formed in June, 1928, in Windsor, where the Communist Party (CP) had a base and the support of a similar auto union established earlier in Detroit. The AWIU was formed after the first GM strike and in the middle
of a rash of other strikes. Labour historian John Manley has argued that “For
most of the 1920s the single voice unreservedly advocating industrial union¬

ism in Canada belonged to the Communist Party (CP).” Until 1927, the CP
worked to spread this message within the craft-based TLC, with virtually no
success It was only after the TLC began to encourage member unions to


-----

expel militants endorsing industrial unionism that the CP began to develop
###### an independent base amongst workers.
 The AWIU called for an industrial unionism based on class struggle but
also encompassing immediate demands in bargaining that were to resurface
###### in the historic strike in Oshawa in 1937, and political demands that reflect¬
ed the potential of unions as a social force. Amongst those demands were
###### the eight-hour day and the forty-four-hour week; an overtime rate of time-
and-a-half; regular shifts; the rejection of the bonus system (pay linked to
###### output) in favour of pay for time worked; enforcement of safety regulations;
equal pay for equal work regardless of age, sex, or race; and unemployment
###### insurance paid for by the state and the employers. The AWIU quickly set up
locals in Toronto and Oshawa, as well as in the Windsor area, but by 1930,
###### the short life of the union was over.
 The companies had become more aggressive in combining wage incen¬
tives as the carrot attached to the stick of firings and intimidation. The
###### union had meanwhile weakened itself through splits over edicts from
Moscow over direction. When the depression hit in 1929, slightly more than
a year since the formation of the AWIU, the devastating collapse of the
industry essentially put further unionization in cold storage for a few winters.

he early years of this century witnessed the arrival of the automobile, a
###### T
product that changed how we live. The restructuring of work that accom¬
panied the automobile’s evolution, especially the development of the assembly
line, radically changed the role and status of skilled workers, robbing many
individuals of their knowledge and ability to use their skills, and undermining
###### their autonomy. Along with this shift to a workforce that was predominantly
semiskilled and unskilled came expanded mechanisms for controlling all work¬

ers. Those controls were rooted in the production system itself: the assembly
line, tight supervision, and methods of payment. But as workers resisted and
looked to unionization, more underhanded and coercive tactics — including
spying on the social and union life of the workers — became common.

###### The first significant hopes of unionization in the automobile industry occurred in the late twenties. This development was, however, blocked by the depression. The severe economic collapse had provided the companies with an additional weapon to push unionism aside. However, the idea of an industrial union had been placed on the agenda, and experience had been
gained. Whether this union could challenge the control of auto giants over

###### The limits and possibilities of bringing unionization to the auto industry
were shaped by the broader social context of the twenties and thirties. The
unsuccessful stabs at unionization of auto in the twenties were part of a more
general defeat of Canadian labour in that decade. Although workers contin-
ued to struggle for union representation in the early thirties, they were con¬
fronted by the seemingly insurmountable obstacles of powerful companies,
###### hostile governments, and an extremely unfavourable economic environ¬ ment. A breakthrough would result only if unionization was part of some¬ thing much bigger.

As the depression dragged on, the failure of the economic system to pro¬
vide any measure of security led to a questioning of the power of the elites
and sometimes of capitalism itself. The collapse of the economy, which had
at first weakened the labour movement, soon led to an explosion of social
protest and organization. Industrial unionism was a fundamental part of that
upsurge, reviving the possibility of finally establishing permanent unions in
auto and the other mass production industries.

###### From Silence to Protest

In 1919, the labour militancy that had been building throughout Canada
during World War I culminated in a general strike in Winnipeg. That strike

was defeated, and that defeat affected Canadian labour well into the thirties.
Business moved quickly and with confidence to consolidate its victory. For
business, with American capital playing a prominent role, it was a period of
###### dramatic expansion and concentration of corporate power. Keenly aware of the opportunities in the new mass production industries such as auto, busi¬
ness planned its restructuring of markets, technology, and labour’s role in
###### production.

For unions, the twenties were a decade of falling membership, division,
###### and disarray. Union membership declined by sixteen per cent over the
decade, even though the population increased by 1.6 million. Craft-based
unionism, with its fossilized central labour bodies in both Canada and the
U.S., watched from the sidelines — unable, but also unwilling, to address
###### the new challenge of organizing the unskilled and semiskilled workers in
these industries-of-the-future. Although there were some political upheavals
in provincial and local politics, the Roaring Twenties roared right by the

###### Winnipeg General Strike

 The Winnipeg General Strike of 1919 shut down this major city for six
weeks, leaving decisions about essential services to the workers and their
strike committee. It was supported by organized and unorganized workers,
joined by sporadic sympathy strikes across the country, acknowledged at
rallies in Europe, and even had the support of the police force (they were
eventually replaced). The strike was part of an international explosion of
militancy in the West after World War I, which in Europe temporarily
threatened to overthrow governments and even the capitalist system.

###### The strike began over the issue of union recognition but, with the
employers’ intransigence and the workers’ growing confidence, it quickly
escalated into the most encompassing general strike in North America —
before or since. The strike represented a peak of labour militancy, but it
also revealed labour’s weakness in confronting the employer-state alliance.

Those heady days, and the response of the employers and the
government, left a legacy that influenced both the culture of the labour
movement and the future development of working class parties. But the
defeat also set the stage for labour’s limited role in the twenties.

earlier in mining, rail, and the textile industries. But by 1920, its most radi¬
cal sections had been savagely repressed by employers and the state, and the
###### remaining base became marginalized.
 In the twenties, employers looked for less overt and more stable ways to deal with the economic restructuring ahead. Major companies such as
Massey-Harris, which manufactured agricultural machinery, introduced so-
###### called industrial councils to take advantage of the demoralized state of labour and to circumvent the development of independent unionism. These councils were really a form of company unionism, which sometimes included profit-sharing schemes and generally restricted workers to playing an advisory role on a plant-by-plant basis. In the steel industry in Hamilton, the union was eventually able to capture the council structure
in the founding of an independent union. But the more common outcome
was that summarized by G.D. Robertson, the federal minister of labour, in

February, 1921:


-----

If the industrial council plan had not been brought into
existence I am very sure that today our industrial difficulties
would be much greater than they are ... because of it, thou¬
sands of men in this country have had their viewpoints
###### altered and have seen and realized the difficulties with
which their employers have to contend.

###### These councils were common in the twenties, though rare within the
young auto industry. General Motors Canada made a tentative move in this
###### direction after the 1928 Oshawa strike, but neither GM nor the other auto
majors found it necessary to follow suit elsewhere in either Canada or the
U.S. until the thirties, when unionization became a more general threat.
Like their present counterparts, these management-initiated union alterna¬
tives were primarily geared to workers’ identification with the company’s —

as opposed to other workers’ — problems.

Labour’s defeat in the 1920s, and the consequent growing inequality in
###### income and power, became a factor in the coming depression. Without a
strong labour movement and a progressive bloc, income lagged behind the
###### accelerating capacity of the economy to produce goods. A crisis of under¬ consumption became inevitable: who would buy the goods? Without angry demands for an end to speculation and the regulation of the financiers, unsustainable fortunes imparted a superficial glow to a society about to
crumble. And without a countervailing power that challenged the prevail¬
ing orthodoxy of free markets and fiscal restraint, the coming catastrophe
was reinforced.

Four years into the Great Depression, the value of output and exports in
###### the economy had fallen by half. Unemployment had increased tenfold (from under three per cent to over thirty per cent). Incomes across the country had fallen by forty to fifty per cent (over seventy per cent in Saskatchewan). In auto, production was down by eighty per cent and employment, by fifty
per cent. In rail alone, 65,000 workers were laid off. One in eight Canadians
###### depended on a restricted and ungenerous emergency relief system.With the
single exception of the U.S., Canada was hit harder than any other country
by the Great Depression.

###### When the depression hit, unions and other social or political groups were
hardly in a position to respond effectively. But as it became clear that the
###### economy was not going to revive itself, and the squeeze on living standards
would only get worse, opposition grew amongst farmers, young unemployed
workers, and those still working. People began to question the system and its
###### incredible failure to address their needs. The business elite, which had taken the credit for the gains in the Roaring Twenties, was increasingly held accountable for the horror of the thirties, as Conrad, Finkel, and Strong-
Boag note in History of the Canadian People:

###### Nothing disappeared as quickly during the thirties as sup¬ port for laissez-faire. Suddenly unable to find work, people blamed profit-seeking capitalists for their plight and no longer found the ethos of ‘free’ enterprise so captivating.

Farmers lobbied and protested; tenants formed organizations to fight land¬
lords and eviction; families fought local officials for relief; municipal politics
became the scene of popular struggles; workers confronted company goons,
police and sometimes even the militia for the most basic of rights; and the

 These strikes and protests could not have happened without the active intervention of socialists — people who had a vision of society beyond capi¬

###### that could achieve change. As the practical historians of labour, the social¬
ists brought with them a link to past struggles. They, along with militants
###### they influenced, provided the leadership that gave voice to frustrations and channelled anger into action.
 There have always been links between trade unionism and socialism.
Socialists wanted to replace capitalism, and workers who faced and chal¬
lenged corporate power on a daily basis, readily lent an interested ear to
###### their arguments. For instance, in Germany, socialist parties played a leading
role in establishing the first unions, while in England, the unions built
socialist or labour parties. This overlap of unionism and politics brought rich

###### After World War I, the social¬ ist movement was divided into
two main camps: the communists

Russian Revolution, the upheavals taking place in Central Europe, and gen¬

MAKING PARTS

The worker wears tom gloves.
He stamps enigmatic parts
On a large, heavy, oily machine.
For many hours the worker stands making parts
On a large, heavy, oily machine.
The worker thinks of time, time overwhelms him
Time preoccupies his mind, time oppresses him.
The place where the worker stands is noisy
The smell of oil pervades, makes the worker nauseous.
Occasionally the worker looks up to see
What the other workers are doing.
Some workers are performing the same tasks as he, making parts.
Others, like a greying man holding a broom
Look pleased with themselves,
The worker envies the greying man holding the broom.
The way the greying man holds the broom, free
To hold the broom anyway he pleases,
The worker begins to think of what he’ll do after work.

Visit his kids, perhaps. Go for a beer, perhaps.
Attempt a reconciliation with his wife, perhaps.
The worker looks at the clock on a nearby wall.
The clock never moves,
The worker wants to smash the clock.
He begins to imagine he has been here forever.
The clock never moves.
the clock drives the worker crazy.
They must be holding back the clock or keeping it still.
The worker begins to misjudge the rhythm of the machine.
The worker stares at the machine with contempt.
The worker miscalculates the rhythm of the machine
The workers hand hesitates, confused.
The worker sacrifices harmony for speed.
The worker becomes distraught.
The inexorable movement of the machine captures the worker’s hand
The clock never moves.

sized that a strategy which depended solely or even primarily on parliament
would fail. It was absolutely crucial to build a base that provided people with
###### both a full appreciation of what was at stake and organizations through which they could defend themselves and fight for change. The working class
was given the preeminent place in communist theory and practice, because
of its direct participation in production, access to organizational resources,
###### and potential leadership role in society. The main focus of communists was therefore to unify workers as a social force and develop amongst workers the understanding, confidence, and skills necessary for carrying out their poten¬ tial role.
 Throughout the twenties and especially in the thirties, communists
played a leading role in strikes, in local protests of all kinds, and in organiz¬
ing the unemployed and linking them with the employed. Few workers
###### accepted the communist call for a revolution. But many responded to the arguments of the communists and respected their militancy, the resources and networks they brought to struggles, and their clear commitment to
workers. In the thirties and forties, it was the communists who developed
###### the deepest roots within the working class and trade unions, including those of the UAW in Canada.
 Canadian social democrats coalesced into the CCF (Cooperative Commonwealth Federation) in 1932. Its founding members included a loose
alliance of fanners, workers, and urban intellectuals. In those first years, with
capitalism’s credibility increasingly challenged by the waste of the depression
and by the possible development of a new party, the CCF insisted on calling
itself a “movement” rather than a “party.” As a movement, the focus was on
###### educating, organizing, and inspiring people with possibilities and a vision.
Leaders distributed reading lists, formed study groups, and travelled across the
###### country to inform and to debate the issues. Newspapers were established to
disseminate information and analysis: during the thirties, the CCF’s central
news co-op supported six newspapers in six different provinces.

###### Although the CCF’s Regina Manifesto (adopted in 1933) echoed with denunciations of capitalism, the views of the groups that made up the CCF alliance were very diverse. The CCF quickly evolved to an orientation
geared to the reform, rather than the replacement, of the existing system. It
viewed workers as an important constituency but not as the central actor in
social change, and, unlike the communists, the CCF leaders chose parlia¬
###### ment as their main arena for struggle. This development led social democ¬
rats away from the emphasis on mobilization and concern with in depth

 tion of the UAW, cooperation between communists and social democrats (the latter considering themselves simply “socialists”) was at a peak in both Canada and the United States. The broad left that eventually developed within the Canadian UAW emerged from this period and includ¬ ed communists, many CCF members, and independent militants.
 But the institutional demands of the CCF and the CP (i.e. the growth and influence of the two groups within the unions), and the interaction between these demands and internal union conflicts over positions and poli¬ cies, increased tensions and aggravated divisions. David Lewis, national sec¬ retary of the CCF at the time, made it clear in his autobiography (David Lewis, The Good Fight), that the CCF’s top priority in the unions was “to wrest control from the communists” no matter how “negative and distaste¬ ful” the process nor how “lacking in idealism” were some of the trade union¬ ists with whom the CCF consequently made alliances.
 Social democrats attacked the communists as impractical extremists. More important, and with some legitimacy, they charged that the CP’s cen¬ tralized structure was undemocratic and that the party itself was dependent on Moscow. That dependence led to swings in policy based on Moscow’s needs and dictates, rather than those of Canadian workers, and it made workable alliances impossible. Communists responded, also with some legiti¬ macy, that the parliamentary strategy of the CCF led to a preoccupation with convincing business of the respectability of social democrats. These conflicts not only damaged work amongst the working class, but also meant that social

###### Charlie McDonald, a Ford employee in the late twenties who eventually
became a president of Windsor Local 200, remarked that in the early days,
all those who fought for workers were united in that they were all labelled
“communists.” He added that “The alleged commies were crucial to building
###### the union in the early days ... Nobody else back then was crazy enough to
believe it was possible ...”

###### Enter the CIO: Stepping on the Gas

 In spite of the impressive protests and developments in Canada, the most dramatic mobilizations and the most significant changes occurred in the United States. The American economy was much more developed and
urbanized than Canada’s. Corporations had grown the fastest in the U.S. in
###### the twenties, and the American economy had fallen the hardest in the
depression. As in Canada, business heroes who so gladly took the credit for
###### the good times were now less happy to be held accountable for the bad. Relative to Canada, the mythic size of the American heroes and the opti-
mism of their promises left a proportionately greater resentment towards
###### their failures.

In 1932, with the economy in a shambles, financial markets in chaos, the
###### economic and political elite in a daze about what to do, and the Republican
Party in disrepute, Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected. Roosevelt viewed his
###### mandate as saving capitalism by reforming it. He initiated the New Deal promising above all else to restore a sense of hope. His recovery program included bank regulation, credit to farmers, massive public works programs
(especially in rural areas), a conservation program linked to jobs for young
###### people, unemployment insurance and pensions, and labour reform that
would limit the use of injunctions against workers and support the right to
organize. This last right was driven less by any long-term commitment to
###### the ideals of unionism than by Roosevelt’s need to have labour as an ally and by the recognition that competition through wage cuts would drive pur¬ chasing power down, blocking any recovery.
 The legislation Roosevelt introduced to promote union recognition was at this point very weak. But the impact of the public legitimacy the presi¬ dent gave to unionization cannot be underestimated. There was, according to the American Federation of Labor (AFL) executive, a “virtual uprising” of workers spontaneously organizing themselves to unionize In the period


-----

from 1933 to 1935, the number of union members increased by one-third in
###### the U.S., as almost one million workers rushed to join. In contrast, over the
same period in Canada, union membership declined.

###### American companies did not share the new enthusiasm for giving work¬
ers an independent voice. The workers’ zeal for unions and a measure of
democracy in the workplace was met and matched by a corporate determi¬
###### nation to keep these allegedly radical unions out. As the confrontations
escalated, workers broadened the fight to include the unemployed, to bring
###### non-union workers into their struggles, and to introduce new and innova¬
tive tactics. In general, American socialists and communists played critical
leadership roles in these struggles.

###### The polarization of American society, in and out of the workplace, and the failure of business to put forth any agenda that could solve both the eco¬ nomic crisis and growing social problems pushed the New Deal further. In
1935, Roosevelt’s administration introduced, amongst other things, legisla¬
###### tion on minimum labour standards (wages, hours of work, working age) and union recognition. The Wagner Act was designed to limit and control
industrial unrest by granting workers the right to organize. The act estab¬
lished the freedom of workers to organize unions of their own choice with¬
###### out employer harassment and put in place labour boards to enforce this
right, supervise elections, certify unions, and ensure that employers negoti¬
ated with the chosen union. The legislation excluded the past practice of
allowing companies to establish company unions alongside a properly elect¬
ed independent union.

###### The new protections for union activists meant that battles with employ¬
ers could be fought on more equal terrain. But they also meant that the
###### union could survive even if it lost a particular battle. Before the legislation,
if a union lost a strike, it was gone. Without union recognition and with the
###### employer free to fire activists at will, those activists still around after a defeated strike were defenseless. With the legislation, American workers
seemed to be on the verge of the breakthrough to industrial unionism.

But the craft-based structure of the existing unions remained a barrier. At
an AFL convention in 1935, John Lewis of the United Mineworkers chal¬
lenged the leaders and the affiliates to move towards industrial unionism. He
###### had experienced the growing militancy in his own union in which recom¬
mended contracts had been repeatedly rejected by the rank-and-file, and he
knew that the radicalization of workers in the new industries would only

###### American Workers Rebel

In the textile industry, 325,000 American workers used cavalcades of
pickets in cars and trucks to shut down workplaces across the southeast in
September, 1934. In San Francisco, a strike by longshoremen — led by a
rank-and-file movement after the existing leadership refused to do so —
included a series of confrontations that saw 1,700 scabs brought in, two
workers killed by police, and then a general strike in July, 1934, with an
estimated 130,000 workers off the job. (This included restaurant workers,
taxi-drivers, cleaners and dryers.)

In Minneapolis in May, 1934, teamsters led a fight out of a strike
headquarters in an old garage. Five hundred workers were ready, at any
time, to join picket lines. This number included mechanics working around
the clock to service the 100 trucks available to transport the picket and a
###### kitchen which, at its peak, served 10,000 meals in one day. In the same month in Toledo, a strike at an auto parts plant (Auto-lite) was weakened
by an injunction and 1,500 scabs until unemployed workers, previously
organized in unemployed councils, joined the fight and eventually forced
the recognition of the union and the rehiring of the strikers. Two more
workers were shot and killed.

Organizations of the unemployed had been playing a major role
since before Roosevelt’s election. In 1930, over one million unemployed
workers were, according to some estimates, involved in demonstrations
across the United States. Funerals for workers killed became political
demonstrations of solidarity. In New York, 50,000 marched in one funeral
after a worker was killed in a demonstration of the unemployed.

In 1932, a funeral in Detroit for four workers killed in a march of
###### the unemployed on Ford’s Dearborn plant included an estimated 20,000
people. The march had called for jobs, reduced work-time, free coal for the
winter, medical care for employed and unemployed workers, and union
recognition. In Chicago, approximately 60,000 came out in support at a
funeral for three people killed in a fight over the eviction of a widow in one
of Chicago’s African-American neighbourhoods.

leaders from industries including textiles, rubber, radio, printing, and auto to
form the CIO. His own union supplied the majority of staff and resources to
###### start building industrially based unions. Over 150 full-time organizers were recruited and paid by the United Mineworkers to organize steelworkers.

###### The American labour movement could now combine the spontaneous
militancy of workers confronted with the depression; militant leaderships at
###### the local and national levels; public support (or at least less resistance from
governments, the police, and the courts); and a structure appropriate to the
###### new challenges. The remaining details were when, where, and how the movement would make that crucial breakthrough toward complete organi-
zation of a major industrial sector.

###### Canada: Shifting Out of Low

In Canada, as in the U.S., the despair of the depression and the discrediting
of the elites eventually led to resistance and growing militancy. This mili¬
###### tancy led to local victories and even national advances. For example, in
response to the growing unrest, some leading members of the business com¬
###### munity accepted the need for an unemployment insurance program as a
concession to the unemployed. In 1934, Charles Gordon, one of Canada’s
leading industrialists with close links to the banking sector, made the fol¬
lowing argument in a letter to the prime minister, R.B. Bennett: “May I sug¬
gest ... that for our general self-preservation some such arrangement (of
###### unemployment insurance) will have to be worked out in Canada.” (In fact,
however, unemployment insurance didn’t come into effect until 1941).

Soon after these events and prior to an election, Bennett — as business-
###### oriented a prime minister as Canada ever had — made an astonishing
about-face arguing that “free competition and the open marketplace, as they
were known in the old days, have lost their place in the system and the only
###### substitute ... is government regulation and control.” The prime minister
went on to advocate, as part of his election platform, his own New Deal,
###### which sounded very much like the American New Deal.

Bennett’s conversion arrived too late to compensate for the losses in cred¬
ibility he had accumulated over the preceding five years. But whether or not
he was sincere, this turnaround reflected the same general factors that were

also at work in the United States: the continuing bankruptcy of business and
conservatives in dealing with the crisis and the growing pressures mobilized
by the opposition outside of parliament. To those fighting for change, even
###### the defeats left in their wake precious new contacts with other individuals
and groups, as well as anger waiting for an outlet of expression. And the
growing activism politicized thousands of formerly demoralized Canadians

###### try. They involved garment
workers in Montreal, fishermen
###### in British Columbia, chicken
pluckers in Stratford, miners at Noranda-Rouyn in Quebec, and textile and
###### furniture workers in Toronto. The majority of these strikes were led by the
Workers Unity League (WUL), the communist labour central.

###### In auto, the failure to organize at the assemblers had shifted the focus to the parts industry and the possibility of making inroads in smaller, more manageable confrontations. These strikes were led by the Auto Workers Union (formerly the Automobile Workers’ Industrial Union), also a WUL affiliate. Although one-third of the workforce in the Windsor area was unemployed in 1933, signs of an economic upturn encouraged strike action
in the auto parts sector. By early 1934, two successful strikes had taken place
###### (at Auto Specialties and Windsor Bedding), a third was under way (at Canadian Motor Lamp), and others were waiting in the wings. At Auto


-----

Specialties, after hearing that the company might “scab” the plant (hire
###### temporary workers during the strike), hundreds of unemployed workers joined the picket line in solidarity.
 The fight for union recognition couldn’t, however, be won in the auto
parts sector — the auto majors simply would not let that historic precedent
be won amongst their suppliers. And so the parts companies would, when
necessary, make concessions to workers in good times. When, however, cir-
cumstances moved in the companies’ favour, management used the down¬
###### turn to fire union activists and demoralize the rest of the workforce. Even
where the movement had a foothold and made gains, it didn’t yet have the
capacity to sustain the fight in the workplace and build a union.

###### Through this period, only about fifteen per cent of Canadian workers
were unionized, a figure comparable to that for the U.S., but less than half
###### the level British unionists had achieved in an earlier period. In addition, few
of these workers were in the increasingly crucial industrial sector. The mobi¬
lization that had taken place, as impressive as it was, remained local and
regionally based. The workplaces and communities that engaged in struggles
###### had few ties with each other; even strong regional movements — farmers in
Saskatchewan, miners in Nova Scotia — remained isolated from one anoth¬

er. The missing link was the strong national political force that could bring
###### Canada its own New Deal.

From today’s perspective, it may seem that the CCF was the logical
###### inheritor of the social democratic task of creating a more favourable politi¬
cal climate for unionism. But the CCF was itself regionally based (indepen¬
###### dent farmers formed its strongest core), and it was especially weak amongst
industrial workers. In 1934, for example, the CCF in Ontario was virtually
paralyzed after the Ontario leadership was ousted by the national office for
###### having moved too far to the left and cooperating with communists. The CCF did not become a serious political threat to the Liberals and the Tories until almost a decade later, after the industrial unions were more firmly
established and the CCF had secured roots in these unions.

###### n the context of the depression and given the power wielded by employers J
over workers desperate for a job, successful unionization called out for a
measure of public legitimacy and legal-administrative support from govern¬
ments and the courts. Without these elements, the task of building and sus¬
###### taining organizations to take on the corporations was overwhelming. The
young movement could not overcome the barriers it faced — high unem-


-----

###### ployment, corporations still powerful in spite of some loss of credibility, and the refusal of the state to acknowledge unionism as a basic democratic right.
As it turned out, the missing ingredient in the thirties did not come from
###### political developments within Canada; it came from the inspiration of the CIO victories in the United States.
 Canada did not have a New Deal, but by way of the CIO, the American
working class essentially shared its victory with Canadians. The CIO pro¬
vided the opening that let Canadians move on to their own victories. When
autoworkers in Flint and across the American Mid-west — who were in a
###### position to win — took on GM, the Canadian border couldn’t block the
power, excitement, and implications of that victory.

###### The period between the two world wars was a time of rapid change in the
economy and in society. Working people were generally marginalized in the
###### sharing of benefits and, especially, in influencing the direction of the
changes. From this perspective, the twenties and thirties were a dark period
of disappointments and suffering. Yet by the mid-thirties, there was a bud¬
ding and vibrant mini-revolt against the failure of the system to address the
concerns of ordinary people.

###### The most exciting of the new movements — the movement for industri¬
al unionism — didn’t come out of the blue. It emerged out of a general cli¬
###### mate of resistance and protest. The breakthrough occurred in the United
States and, more by example than anything else, it flowed into Windsor, St.
###### Catharines, and then Oshawa, which became the test site for the new
unionism in Canada. After a long and painful lull, working people seemed
ready to participate in the unfolding of history.

###### Flint: Standing Up by Sitting Down

 The UAW was officially born in South Bend, Indiana, in April, 1936. While the AFL had chartered the union the year before, and a constitution

was jointly drafted by the AFL and UAW, it was the AFL executive that
###### appointed the president. In response, approximately 1,200 determined dele¬
gates forced the AFL to both grant them the autonomy to elect their own
president, Homer Martin, and expand the UAW’s jurisdiction to include all
workers in the sector. At that point, the UAW began to make plans to take
###### on the industry giant, GM. Autoworkers intended to show not only that the
UAW had arrived, but also that it was unpacking its bags and settling in as a
###### permanent fixture in workers’ relationships with employers.
 The experience and confidence for the famous test of strength in Flint,
Michigan, which was the centre of GM’s production empire, were the prod¬
###### uct of crucial work stoppages throughout the industry in 1935 and 1936. The protest at Flint was preceded by strikes to establish the UAW at GM in Cleveland, Atlanta, and Kansas City; at parts plants including Bendix and
Kelsey; and at Chrysler’s Dodge plant, where workers had already won
seniority rights and overtime pay. (In the mid- to late thirties, Chrysler was¬
n’t the “little sister” of the Big Three; it was selling as many or more vehi¬
cles than Ford.)

his productivity. He asks that the savings due to the inauguration of the
machinery and changes in technical methods shall be equitably divided between
management, the investor, and the worker. The automobile worker asks that
those who may be discharged be paid adequate dismissal wages to enable them to

and that it make provision through ameliorative social laws for the innocent and

 With the workplace as their base, employees could more effectively defend themselves, reduce violence and — with the complete shut-down of production — shorten strikes. The workplace even became a social space, democratically organized for discussions and entertainment; subcommittees watched over the equipment, distributed food and information, and planned
for the defence of the plant in an attack. The logic of sit-downs is, in fact, so
###### compelling that the real question isn’t why workers once used this strategy, but why and how it so quickly disappeared from labour’s arsenal.

as the workers flushed the police away with water hoses. This action led the
###### governor to call in the National Guard — not, as the company wished, to
break the strike, but to prevent other attacks by the police or city vigilantes
###### and to keep the peace.

As time dragged on, the workers started to grow weary, and the company
seemed to be getting the upper hand; the union astutely decided to escalate
###### the struggle. Aware of GM spies in their midst, union members leaked infor¬ mation about another planned takeover, this time at Chevrolet Plant Nine
in the Flint complex, and had the workers in that facility battle the police
###### to divert them. Meanwhile, a separate core of workers took over the real tar¬
get — Chevrolet Plant Four, which made the engines for all the Chevrolet
assembly plants.

###### The ruse succeeded brilliantly. Ten days later and forty-four days into the
strike, GM was feeling the economic pressure; but more important, the com¬
###### pany realized that the union would not, at least at this point in time, be defeated. On 11 February 1937, GM recognized the union and agreed to enter into discussions on a collective agreement. At the beginning of the Flint sit-down, UAW membership stood at 88,000. Six months later, virtual¬

ly all the major companies in auto, with the exception of Ford, had unions,
###### and UAW membership stood at over 400,000. With Flint as the spark, over¬

from under 4 million to over 8 million. Over the same period, membership
in Canadian unions increased by only 80,000.

###### Oshawa: Taking on the Motors

 In Canada, the first UAW local — Kelsey Wheel in Windsor (a subsidiary
of Kelsey Hayes Wheel in Detroit) — was chartered as Local 195 on 9
December 1936, shortly before the sit-down in Flint. The Kelsey workers
won an agreement after holding one of Canada’s first sit-downs and a strike,
and after workers at the parent company in Detroit threatened to go on
strike in support of their Canadian brothers and sisters. In spite of the settle¬
###### ment, the agreement did not acknowledge the UAW as the formal represen¬ tative of the workers; that recognition would take Kelsey Wheel workers until 1948 to achieve. Nevertheless, the strength of the membership in
Windsor meant that the company had to deal with the union whether or
###### not there was official recognition. Nine days after the Kelsey Wheel workers

 On Monday, 15 February 1937, the same day that the Flint workers returned to work, sheet-metal workers in Oshawa put down their tools as GM Canada increased the line speed from twenty-seven units to thirty-two
units per hour. The order for the change, which came from Detroit, may have

downs in the U.S.

###### The workers gave management an ultimatum: the company must deal with their issues or face a strike by the end of the week. Meanwhile, they
called the UAW in Detroit for assistance. On Friday of that week, during a
###### meeting at which the two parties were going over the workers’ demands,
Hugh Thompson, an organizer from the UAW, arrived. In spite of opposi¬
###### tion from the government’s mediator, the workers insisted on hearing Thompson. That same afternoon, all 200 sheet-metal workers joined the
union. They followed Thompson’s advice to return to work while the union
###### negotiated on their behalf, and Thompson set up an office to sign up union
members.

###### Within a month, virtually every worker had joined the union. Even
workers outside of the industry came to sign up, and the mayor himself
became an honorary member. The worker demands included higher wages,
###### shorter hours, overtime pay, seniority, an in-plant committee (stewards),
and recognition of the UAW. In the course of the negotiations, the union
###### got a boost when it was peacefully able to secure other agreements in Oshawa, including union recognition, at Coulter Manufacturing and Ontario Steel. On 6 April, the UAW in the United States extended the achievement of union recognition to Chrysler after a four-week sit-down in Detroit. However, the union did not reach an agreement with GM in Canada, and on 8 April 1937, the strike began.

Since the 1928 and 1929 strikes, there had been a number of skirmishes
in Oshawa, but these had quickly faded. In 1937, there was a slight upturn
in the economy, especially in auto. Although its own profits were at record
levels, GM insisted on cuts in pay, just as it had in 1928. But 1937 was not

before they came to Canada, were committed supporters of unionization.

Letter from the Mine Mill local in Sudbury sent to Hugh Thompson, the UAW
organizer during the Oshawa strike, asking him to come up north and bring Mine
Mill into the union. As it turned out, Mine Mill joined the autoworkers —fifty-
five years later. (The road to that merger was hardly inevitable; it included bitter
fights within labour and ultimately involved difficult and agonizing decisions.)

###### decline in prices in that period. Although there were many accumulated frustrations — harassment by supervisors, unsafe conditions, long hours,
insecurity, and the attempt to speed up the line that caused the work stop-
page by the sheet metal workers — the wage cuts were the catalyst for the
###### united response by workers throughout the plant.

From GM’s perspective, keeping the union out was one way to offset the
fact that the scale of Canadian operations was much smaller than that of
###### American plants. This difference reflected the more general fact of Canadian labour relations: because of the structure of the Canadian econo¬
my — the smaller market, the shorter runs, the technological dependence

  - Canadian operations were less productive. But Canadian workers, who
were as hard-working and capable as their American counterparts, weren’t
responsible for the structure of the economy, and they refused to accept sec¬
###### ond-class citizenship within any company’s operations. Amongst skilled
workers in particular and especially in border cities, the high mobility of
workers already kept the wage differential relatively low. (Before World War
II, auto wages in Windsor were comparable to those in Detroit.)

###### This gap between the expectations of the workers and the corporation’s
desire to keep profits high in Canada was partially offset by the high tariff
###### on cars, which allowed the companies to charge more for their products. Whenever the tariff was lowered, the companies translated the drop into greater pressures for wage restraint and/or an increase in the line speed.
Decreasing tariffs were a factor in GM’s pressure on the Oshawa workers in
1927-28 and in the 1937 confrontations. When the Oshawa workers resisted
###### the speed-up and the cuts in wages, and the incentive payments in February
1937, GM threatened (Toronto Star) that: “ ... the parent company wants us
###### to have all bodies manufactured in the U.S. and we can bring them in here, even with the duty, cheaper than it costs to produce them here.”
 Once the strike began on 8 April 1937, both the company and the Ontario premier, Mitch Hepburn, increased the pressure on the Oshawa
workers. Quoted on the front page of the New York Times on 12 April 1937,
###### the GM spokesman warned: “ ... the competitive situation (facing Canadians) justified longer hours to lower production costs.” Hepburn added:
“In a competitive world situation ... the CIO drive would make [it] impossi¬
ble [for the province to be] a great exporter of goods, would keep U.S. capital
out of Ontario, and would prevent existing plants from expanding ....”

###### The facts, however, were that the Canadian operations were profitable in
1937 and GM having conceded to unionization in the U S was unlikely


-----

###### to go through a long strike to block it in Canada. The catch was the inter¬ vention of the premier, whose aggressive anti-union position hardened GM’s
own position and encouraged GM to extend the strike. Hepburn was look¬
ing beyond GM and hoping to block the CIO’s expansion into Canadian
###### manufacturing and, especially, into the resource sector. Ontario’s mines were
a rich source of provincial revenue and the Canadian economy was general¬

ly more dependent on its resource sector than other developed countries. As
###### Hepburn bluntly said to the Globe and Mail on 16 April 1937: “[I am] more concerned with the CIO’s threat in the mine fields than in the automobile
industry.”

###### This statement led the Toronto Star on 23 April 1937 to refer to the Oshawa strike as a “miner’s strike in a motors town.”
 Hepburn, a Liberal, had actually won on a mildly progressive, mildly pro¬ labour ticket in 1934. But, as with other politicians before

“Sons of Mitches.”)

###### The Globe and Mail articulated the class perspective of business and the premier from day one.

###### This paper, which aggressively supported the largest American-based multi¬ national in Canada, even argued, with no hint of shame, that the strike was
about the CIO “dominating and dictating to Canadian industry.” With the

 On 12 April, the arrival of UAW president Homer Martin brought an amazing show of citywide support for what had become a community strike. That evening, 5,000 people rallied to hear speeches and to demonstrate their unity. Discipline — no drinking, no fighting — was rigidly maintained by patrols throughout the strike to avoid giving Hepburn reason to send in troops. The Canadian Forum reported in June, 1937, that: “Veteran labour leaders almost wept when they saw the amazing display of enthusiasm ... never in all the history of the Canadian labour movement had a town been
so completely captured by the sentiment of unionism.”

###### In order to boost morale, Martin had promised financial assistance and sympathy strikes, neither of which he had discussed with the CIO or UAW executive boards and which he could not honour. On Friday 16 April, eight days into the strike, he met with GM executives in Detroit and agreed that the Oshawa strike should be settled without recognition by GM of the CIO. Charles Millard, the president of the Oshawa local and now a full-time CIO organizer, was equally nervous and anxious for a settlement.
 On Monday 19 April, Millard and Thompson confidently brought the proposed settlement to the workers, even though it wasn’t in writing and it didn’t include the recognition of the union that the UAW had won in Flint. The workers were clearly uncertain about what they had won and also suspi-


-----

cious, based on past unfulfilled company promises, of unwritten agreements.
###### The press predicted support for a settlement as workers filed into the meet¬
ing, but the workers surprised their leadership and rejected the offer.

Yet by the end of the week, a written agreement was in place and the
mood had changed. The reasons for the turnaround are not clear. It seems
###### that with some gains made, with the leadership forcefully arguing that it
could not do any better, and with it becoming evident that neither financial
assistance nor sympathy strikes would come from the United States, workers
concluded that they really had no choice but to end the fifteen-day strike.
###### At the next meeting on Friday 23 April, the workers were buoyant and full
of camaraderie. In spite of shortcomings in the agreement, they had gained a
sense of achievement in taking on GM and enthusiastically voted — by a
margin of 2205 to thirty-six — to return to work.

###### The settlement included wage gains, though wages remained some
twelve to fifteen per cent below those paid at GM’s American plants. There

was seniority for lay-offs and rehiring, a nine-person bargaining committee,
a grievance procedure, and a guarantee of no reprisals against union
activists. The work week was shortened to forty-four hours with overtime
pay of time-and-a-half; the regular week was nine-hour days Mondays to
Thursdays and an eight-hour day on Friday. Canada’s work week was still
longer than the forty-hour week established at GM in the United States
###### that March. And the union settled without achieving its original goal, the
crucial goal won in the U.S. at both GM and Chrysler: recognition of the
UAW. Hepburn immediately claimed victory.

Yet the fact that the workers had survived in the face of Hepburn’s cru¬
sade against the CIO and after taking on the largest company in the world
and the power of the state, meant victory was really theirs. The day after the
Oshawa settlement, buoyant and optimistic CIO organizers and supporters
were already distributing leaflets in the electrical and steel plants of Toronto
and Hamilton. Others carried the CIO message across Ontario and beyond.
###### In the New York Times on 24 April 1937, Charles Millard, the president of the Oshawa local, aptly summed up the situation: “I know and they know
and the world knows the union has been recognized.”

In spite of many initial successes, the drive to extend industrial unionism
###### remained fragile. Workers carrying the CIO banner were harassed and often prevented from holding public meetings. They were fired and blacklisted,
spied on, and confronted by strikebreakers. “Canadian governments,” as

 After the growth between 1936 and 1938, the number of organized
workers in Canada actually fell over the next two years. By the end of the
###### thirties less than eighteen per cent of the Canadian workforce was orga¬
nized, compared to twenty-five per cent in the United States. The UAW’s
###### membership dropped from about 10,000 in 1937 to under 5,000 in Canada,
while it reached almost half a million in the U.S. Of Canada’s dozen locals
###### that existed a year earlier, only three were still active.
 In Oshawa, the dues-paying membership fell to as low as 400 in a work¬
force of about 3,000. The local was desperate to recover its membership
base, yet it was unable to deliver any material gains from the company. It
###### therefore tried to maintain some links by way of social networks such as fish- ing/hunting clubs and bowling leagues, and through services such as credit unions. But it wasn’t until 1943 that Local 222 signed its next agreement


-----

Organizing had also slowed in the U.S., though not to the same extent as
in Canada. In Flint, for example, only 500 of 32,000 workers were paying
###### union dues in 1938. The crisis facing the American UAW, which also affect'
ed the Canadians, was aggravated by the economic downturn, but it
stemmed essentially from an internal fight between its president, Homer
###### Martin, and a group that included communists, socialists (such as the
Reuthers), and other militants.

###### Martin, it seemed, had become president of the young union primarily
on the basis of his skills as an orator and the absence of strong personal ene¬
mies in any section of the union. His lack of administrative and strategic
skills soon became evident, but by 1938 his actions had become dangerously
erratic. He made secret deals with the companies, and, apparently in return,
Ford bought him a house when he eventually left the company. He arbitrari¬

ly fired board members who disagreed with him and he banned local union
newspapers and direct contact between locals. He undermined wildcats
###### (mid-contract walk-outs) and refused workers the right to ratify their agree¬
ments. Then, when the executive board rejected his direction, he even went

so far as to set up an alternative union affiliated with the AFL.

###### Given the vulnerability of the new union, Martin’s destructive actions seri¬
ously weakened the effectiveness of the UAW, even in plants where it had
won recognition. The auto companies, and especially GM, argued that they
no longer knew which union was legitimate (the CIO union or the Martin-
backed AFL union) and refused to negotiate with either one. The turmoil
seriously threatened the union’s existence until Martin was finally deposed at
the 1939 convention and replaced by R.J. Thomas. This change in leadership,
###### combined with the upturn that followed the outbreak of World War II,
brought a degree of stability to the union.

###### A parallel fight was taking place within the Canadian section of the union. Charles Millard, the president of the Oshawa local, had originally been appointed director of the Canadian region. Although this appoint¬ ment was subsequently endorsed in an election, Millard’s support was weak and the union was stumbling. His alliance with the unpopular Homer Martin, albeit temporary, didn’t help his credibility. And Millard’s focus on
asserting the dominance of the CCF inside the union was generally viewed
by both activists and members as being unnecessarily divisive, since there

was at that time a strong working relationship within the union between CP
###### members, CCF supporters, and independent militants. In 1939, George

 Beyond Oshawa’s City Limits

 The Oshawa strike was organized and ultimately won in Canada. The American UAW was too new and distracted by the events exploding in its
own country to offer support by way of strike pay, cadres of organizers, or
###### sympathy strikes. Yet the Americans did the most important thing they
could do: they acted decisively in their own country. This action created the
space and led the way for Canadians to do the same.

###### The union had internationalized the struggle not because of any formal cross-border institutions, but by way of the solidarity of Canadians and Americans taking on, within their own spheres of activity, the common
enemy. Victor Reuther, Walter Reuther’s youngest brother and one of the
leaders in the breakthrough at Flint, understood this principle when speak¬
ing, almost fifty years later, to the Canadian section of the UAW as it
###### embarked on the formation of its own union: "... let us not stretch the ... importance of organic [i.e., institutional] unity as though without it, it is


-----

###### THE CANADIAN COUNCIL

After the Oshawa strike, activists from each of the four locals in the
Canadian section of the UAW began to meet regularly to deal with their
common problems, give some direction to their activities, and impose some
accountability on the director, whose internal support was weak. Frustrated
because they had no formal status in the union, and learning that the UAW
constitution allowed for just such a structure, they formed a regional
committee at a meeting in Brantford in 1938 and then applied for and got a
charter to establish the Canadian Council in 1939.

The radically democratic principle behind this clause was that delegates
elected by the membership should have their own structure, parallel to the
administrative structure of the union and with its own elected executive
and independent financing, to act as a check on the regional director and
the staff.

The director would be invited to each meeting — originally held six
times a year but later quarterly — to give both an oral and written report on
his or her activities in the preceding period. Over the years, it was almost
unheard of for the director to be exempt, by reason of any extenuating
circumstances, from providing the delegates a lengthy written report.

The council itself had no binding power on policy, but its authority —
originally based on its democratic base but reinforced over time by the
weight of tradition — meant that it became the real parliament of the
union. The divisions within this emerging parliament were not so much the
“administration” vs. the “rank-and-file,” but ideological; it was at the
council that so many of the ideological fights and ideological shifts got
played out. As the ideological differences in the union collapsed, so did the
notion of the council as an independent or parallel structure. But while this
changed the tone of the council, it didn’t undermine the crucial role it
played within the union.

The council went beyond just monitoring the director and his or her
activities. It was an exciting educational forum where the director could
inform and raise the broadest issues; where new delegates could hear
experienced debaters raising the issues and attacking corporations,
governments, and each other; where those same new delegates would
nervously make their first interventions in front of peers beyond their local;
and where the director and the staff could get a better sense of the mood of
the rank-and-file.

The council was also a cultural forum, especially when held in the
workers’ own educational camp. It gave local leadership precious time to

was therefore an institution
###### that linked the union together
vertically (by creating
relations between top leadership and activists), horizontally (by allowing
activists to meet and work directly with each other rather than just depend
on connections via the top leadership) and generationally (by establishing
an ongoing continuity between past activists and traditions and emerging
militants and issues).

###### The council structures never took hold in the U.S.; by the early fifties
they were already dormant. The difference in Canada was twofold. First,
Canada was a separate country and therefore needed a mechanism for
having its own discussions and debates and, at times, for challenging or
resisting the American leadership. Without its own national executive
board and given the limits of injecting Canadian perspectives into an
overwhelmingly American-based convention, the idea of a Canadian
council had obvious attractions. Second, the Canadian section of the
union included an opposition dependent on the council for access to other
activists. Any attempt to undermine the council could be powerfully
countered by mobilizing the members around democracy and nationalism.
(In fact, no such move to get rid of the council was ever attempted.)


-----

###### This Canada-U.S. solidarity did not preclude tensions. In fact, the rela¬ tionship between the Canadians and the Americans involved, from the
beginning, conflicting pressures and strains that would dominate the union’s
politics and evolution until the Canadian breakaway. The Canadians, as in
###### other relationships between the two countries, were the dependent partner; the Americans, as senior partner, set the stage. The Canadians lagged behind in obtaining union recognition (not just at GM but at each of the

Big Three companies), comparable wages, and other negotiated gains. Yet
###### the Canadians, in large part because they were not simply another region of the UAW, also maintained a level of independence and cohesiveness. These
elements would form the base for keeping alternative perspectives alive and,
eventually, for developing the degree of self-confidence that would result in
###### the union taking a different direction.
 That independence was manifested in the creation of a particularly important and dynamic democratic institution: the Canadian Council. Although this structure was not unique to Canada — the UAW constitu¬ tion set out the council’s voluntary creation at the regional level — the Canadian section was alone in keeping its council over the years. The
Americans had overcome a dangerous leader after a painful period by depos¬
ing him. The Canadians, who were not in a position to determine the North
###### American leadership, took the issue of ongoing accountability one step fur¬ ther and deepened their own democracy with the establishment of this insti¬ tution.

Beyond the effects on the UAW and other CIO unions, the Oshawa
###### strike also had a crucial and lasting impact on the future direction of Canadian politics. The premier’s rejection of the moderately progressive political space that the Liberals formerly held did not, at first, seem to hurt Hepburn electorally. Running on an anti-CIO ticket in the next provincial election, his Liberals swept the province. The virtual collapse of the Canadian UAW at GM in the late thirties was reflected electorally in the
easy win by Hepburn’s Liberals in the Oshawa riding. Yet this provincial vic¬
tory was the Ontario Liberal’s last hurrah.

###### The election reflected the facts that the Conservative Party had been
discredited by its policies during the depression and the CCF had not yet
###### gotten off the ground in Ontario (its vote was under six per cent). In the next election, with the CCF moving into the political vacuum that Hepburn and the Liberals had left in their attacks on the Oshawa workers, the Liberals lost and were not to return to office in the province for over

four decades. The mercurial rise of the CCF — it was at or near the top of
###### the polls in 1942—43 — shifted both the federal Liberals and Conservatives
towards the centre-left, and had them advocating the rudiments of what
would become Canada’s social safety net after the war.

###### he victory in Oshawa can today be identified, in the words of an editor¬ T
ial in a church publication at the time, as “not just another industrial
dispute [but] a phase in a movement of great significance” (New Outlook, 23
###### April 1937). Yet that movement remained very fragile. In the late thirties, it
was stalled by the inevitable corporate counterattack, the difficult economic
times, internal union problems, and a Canadian state that was at best indif¬
###### ferent and at worst openly hostile. Nor was any broader political alternative
able to get off the ground.

###### In trying to assess the significant achievements of this difficult period, we
won’t find them so much in the specific gains made or the structures firmly
established, but in the fact that the working class was stirring. It had begun
###### to fight back in spite of the times and thereby build its self-confidence and
organizing skills. Workers were challenging their companies, putting politi¬
cal elites on the spot, questioning past assumptions, and further testing and
###### developing new structures, such as industrial unions, which covered all
workers across companies and entire sectors, and the Canadian Council.

###### The significance of the Oshawa breakthrough therefore lay in its central
role in a new beginning. The struggle in Oshawa established a base for the
###### UAW in Canada. More generally, it created the crucial opening for the CIO, and, less directly, it set the stage for a shift in politics to the centre-
left. From these beginnings — moderate in terms of immediate achieve¬
###### ments but radical in terms of potential — emerged the more substantive

gains of the coming decades.

###### The war economy between 1939 and 1945 provided the Canadian UAW with the opportunity to build on its earlier but very fragile success and estab¬
lish the membership base which would define the UAW for the next four
decades. This base included workers at the Big Three, at major independent
parts companies, in aerospace, and in agricultural implements. In addition
to the numbers, the specific responses of Canadian workers to this period
###### had a significant impact on the emerging character of the union.
 At first, the war, like most wars, tended to unite people around a com¬ mon enemy and a collective goal. This tendency left workers hesitant to take contrary positions, and it legitimized pressures to keep production
rolling. But as the war dragged on, the nature of the changes raised new
###### questions about the organization of production in our society, about the
everyday inequality that contradicted the call to a common purpose, about
###### the subordinate role of workers relative to their employers in a country fighting for democracy, and — as women entered the workforce in such
large numbers — about the role of women in the workplace and in society.

###### The War Ends the Depression

 The war did something depression-era capitalism couldn’t do: it provided
jobs. Bankers stopped warning about the deficit, and corporate executives
###### toned down their insistence that government stay out of the economy. Idle
factories became busy, as the number of workers doubled in manufacturing
and quadrupled in transportation equipment. Governments and companies
###### even introduced child-care services to attract women into the workforce. The government’s own Bank of Canada, along with Victory Bonds, financed

a substantial portion of savings. (The bonds, which were sold by the govern¬
###### ment, carried lower interest but appealed to people’s patriotism.) These
options limited the dependence on foreign borrowing. Crown corporations
were established to guarantee key supplies, such as oil, and vital materials,
such as rubber. And a growing civil service introduced a measure of plan¬
###### ning by way of the conversion to military production, partially regulated
prices, and exchange controls limiting the export of capital as well as unnec¬
essary imports.

###### None of these initiatives, it must be emphasized, undermined the basic
power of those who owned industry and finance. In fact, by the end of the


-----

###### expanded, and profits were skyrocketing. This development wasn’t solely the result of the strong and steady growth. The government had subsidized retooling, expansions, and new plants for military use. And as the war came to an end, the government subsidized the reconversion of these productive
facilities to civilian use. Flourishing crown corporations were sold or virtual'

ly given to the private sector. Canada emerged from the war with sizable
###### potential as a manufacturing nation, though the private sector was much
more integrated with the United States in terms of ownership and trade.

###### Nor did the wartime planning regulate the economy to address the needs of working people. The strong economy and tight labour markets clearly strengthened labour’s position. But the government counteracted with
imposed delays on the right to strike, limits on picketing, and wage controls
in 1940 which froze wages at their 1926-29 levels. In 1942, eighty per cent
###### of manufacturing was involved in war production. Limits were placed on
workers in war industries, preventing them from leaving their jobs for work
elsewhere. And even when, after a period of both intense worker militancy
###### and political gains, the government finally introduced legislation supporting unionization in early 1944, it made strikes against wage controls illegal and
subject to stiff fines.

During the depression, when business was taking advantage of the large
numbers of unemployed and desperate workers, one-sided labour legislation
clearly presented a barrier for unions. However, the significance of such leg¬
###### islation declined with the strong wartime economy and tight labour market. The new conditions empowered any determined workers to establish their unions irrespective of, or at least in spite of, the absence of legislative sup¬ port. Canadian labour, like business, came out of the war stronger. In 1939, union membership in Canada was at 356,000 (seventeen per cent of the
workforce). By the end of the war it had more than doubled to over 724,000
###### (twenty-five per cent of the workforce). At the end of the thirties, the fate of the Canadian section of the UAW was uncertain: its prewar membership
was down to 5,000. By the end of the war, membership had soared to almost

50,000.

###### Getting a Voice

 The outbreak of war didn’t immediately lead to rapid union growth. The
drive to unionization was delayed by the shock of the war, the sense of relief


-----

at the availability of jobs, the lag in actual conversion to military produc-
tion, and the intimidation of the state. In the fall of 1941, GM workers at
###### McKinnon in St. Catharines went on strike for wage parity with Oshawa
and learned first-hand about the rigidity of wartime controls. Uncertain
about its own strength when the strike began and suddenly confronted with
armed RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police) officers, the union never¬
theless survived the seventeen-day strike and made modest wage gains.

###### The turning point in the new drive to unionization again took place in the United States; this time at Ford. Unlike GM and Chrysler, Ford had sur¬
vived the thirties without having to acknowledge the UAW. The company
###### entered the forties confident that the situation would not change. In March,
1941, Henry Ford was quoted in the Toronto Star as declaring: “In my opin¬
ion the unions are losing ground and haven’t a leg to stand on.”

As long as Ford resisted, other major companies harboured hopes of
rolling back the tide of unionism. For decades, Ford had led in the fight to
keep workers in their place, depending in turn on paternalism, wage incen¬
tives, and threats. The company even monitored and spied on workers’ per¬
sonal lives, checking to see if they fulfilled Ford’s “moral” standards. Ford
tried to buy non-union subservience by paying higher wages (though only as
long as the company’s monopoly on assembly line development assured a
flood of profits). Later, Ford hired an internal army of organized gangsters to
monitor, spy on, and intimidate workers. Breaking the anti-union bastion at
Ford was therefore crucial not only because of the new union members it
would bring, but also because of the enormous symbolic weight a victory at
Ford would carry.

###### Although the U.S. hadn’t yet entered the war, its economy was already
booming, and conversion plans were well underway. Ford found itself unable
to hold out given the profitable opportunities it was missing. In April, 1941,

workers went on strike for eight days,

from workers’ paycheques and send them directly to the union.

###### The Windsor workers had been trying to obtain a foothold at Ford since the twenties, and these attempts intensified, though without any immediate
results, after the 1937 victory in Oshawa. The success across the river again
inspired Canadians, as it did in 1937, to take hold of the new possibilities.
###### This time, the workers had the advantage of war-time production demands and proximity. Skilled workers from Windsor, with experience in British trade unionism, had been meeting with the River Rouge workers even before the U.S. strike. Now they intensified their efforts in Windsor. Furthermore, the Americans were now sufficiently established to offer some material support.
 In the fall of 1941, when Ford tried to exclude the Canadian UAW from the ballot by limiting unionization to a vote in favour of or against a compa¬
ny union, Canadian director George Burt and UAW president R.J. Thomas
###### visited Ford headquarters. River Rouge was already in some turmoil, and
Burt and Thomas threatened further workplace disruptions at River Rouge
###### to stop Ford from shipping components for military vehicles to Windsor.
Later, when Ford began flooding the air waves with the company message
###### and no radio station in Ford-dominated Windsor would sell the union air time, the River Rouge local (Local 600) bought time on Detroit radio,
allowing Burt to beam his message back across the river. With the help of
###### their American brothers and sisters, the Canadian workers showed that the union could, quite literally, give the workers a voice.
 The threat of parts shortages quickly got the attention of and a reaction from the federal government. Canada had entered the war before the Americans. Ford, one of the first to fully convert to military production, was
already the leading producer of military vehicles. The government was con¬
###### cerned about its war orders and used its wartime legislation (it could place plants involved in war production under a government-appointed trustee) to pressure Ford into accepting a prompt representational vote.

Ford naturally exploited its access to every worker in the plant. But more
significant, the company offered concessions to the workers if they rejected
###### the UAW. Ford’s promises went beyond the benefits of the UAW victory in
Oshawa. The company offer matched GM in seniority rights, but offered a
###### better deal in both wages and union structure. Ford promised, for example, to recognize not only a bargaining committee but also a steward system to


-----

In 1941 at Kirkland Lake where Mine Mill had an organizing drive, a
conciliation board ruled in favour of a vote so that workers could decide whether
or not to join the union. The company refused to allow a vote and the
government refused to intervene, claiming “neutrality.” The workers went on
strike, and the government demonstrated its neutrality in the form of the police
marching into town to protect scabs. Although the strike lost, many future
activists and leaders emerged from the protest and the government response
reinforced the labour movement’s commitment to win union recognition.

###### handle grievances. But the Ford workers in Windsor had reached an Ere-
versible stage in union consciousness and confidence. They had done the
solid groundwork, organizing inside and outside the plant. A public meeting
###### at Windsor s former Capital Theatre brought 2,000 workers together.
Workers could now discuss the union without fear of company reprisal, and
###### the union had won them the right to vote and a chance to be heard. The
Ford workers were ready to launch the union. In November, 1941, they
###### voted in favour of the UAW by a margin of three to two (6,833 to 4,455).

By January, 1942, the workers had an agreement. Because of the
Americans’ later entry into the war, the UAW in the U.S. didn’t have to

 The negative side of the agreement was that Ford still denied Canadian workers the crucial breakthrough it had accepted in the United States: union security and the dues check-off. Moreover, the achievement of union recognition at Ford did not trigger a general pattern for the Canadian labour movement. Companies generally continued to fight the labour movement even where a union had the clear support of the majority of the membership, and the government endorsed this resistance directly and

###### "A Woman’s Place Is...”

 Within the trade union movement itself, the war brought to the fore a con¬ tradiction that, while not new, could no longer be ignored. The CIO and industrial unionism had crusaded for the equality of all workers, and working
women, especially in the clothing industry, joined unions in large numbers.
But wages in the sectors that employed women were low while in the new
sectors such as auto, companies rarely hired women. Even when women got
jobs in auto, their wages were about two-thirds of men’s (or lower), and
###### management restricted women to separate seniority lists.

###### At GM, in the thirties, the Oshawa and St. Catharines plants each
employed over 200 women. In addition, women reps sat on the bargaining
###### committee, but they generally represented women who worked in segregated departments such as the sewing room. The original GM agreement of 1937 included a clause reading: “In any department in which both men and
women are employed they should be divided into separate non-interchange¬
able occupational groups.”

###### Soon after that agreement, when the economy slowed down and lay-offs returned, the union argued that positions should be found in other depart¬ ments for those women with highest seniority. Although some inequities
were later corrected, GM’s Oshawa plant manager replied, at a meeting on
24 September 1937, that GM would unilaterally decide how many women
###### to hire, adding that “the management did not favour mixing male and
female ‘help’ in a department.”

As young men left for the battlefield and the economy geared itself to
###### the overseas war needs, Canada moved from unemployment to a situation
where, by 1942, companies were competing for workers. For many compa¬
nies and the government, women were the answer. Rather than attracting
scarce workers with higher wages or better conditions, the companies could
###### bring a new pool of labour into the factories and segregate these women workers in certain departments. Confident that the position offered to
women — temporary, new to the labour market, separated from experienced
###### union activists — would limit the development of their trade union con¬
sciousness and make them easier to control, the companies paid them lower

wages.

###### In Oshawa, the number of women workers doubled (to 400); in St. Catharines, over one-quarter of the workforce was now women (1,200 of 4,500); at de Havilland, women (1,775) represented over half the work¬
force. In the auto industry before the war, only one worker in fourteen was
female; this number more than doubled by 1943. In aerospace, the number
###### of women was previously negligible; it rose to better than one in five work¬
ers (though they were still concentrated in certain lines of work). In agricul¬
###### tural implements, the proportion of women quadrupled from about five per cent to almost twenty per cent.
 With popular culture supporting the inclusion of women in the work¬
force and with women participating in production, many thought that pre¬
###### vailing stereotypes of the role of women might change. After all, magazines now glorified the woman who left her home to produce for the war popular

and companies not only endorsed
###### but actually provided child-care
services, and women showed that
they were capable of heavy manufacturing and skilled work.

In spite of the apparent social support for women entering the workforce,
###### their status remained inferior. The gendered division that the auto majors
enforced was effective. If women had, for example, worked on the assembly
line, doing the same work as men, the pressures from both the women and
###### their fellow male unionists might have led to wage parity. But the company
managed to avoid this outcome.

In motor vehicle assembly, employment increased by about 8,400 work¬
ers between 1939 and the wartime peak of 1942-43; but only 130 of these
new workers, less than two per cent, were women. Even though the number
of workers in the assembly sector increased by two-thirds between 1929 and
1949, the number of women — low as it was to start with — actually fell.
###### Women were hired in certain sections of the parts sector, in traditional
women’s departments within the auto majors, or temporary divisions expect¬
ed to disappear after the war. General Motors, for example, created a special
Victory Shift for women which to end when victory achieved


-----

Some definite changes in attitude occurred. The Detroit office of the
###### UAW established a Women’s Bureau. With no automatic dues check-off, the union collected dues on an individual voluntary basis; this increased pressures to set out demands that would gain the support of women. Amalgamated locals such as Local 195 in Windsor and Local 397 in
Brantford, which represented women in auto parts and miscellaneous manu¬
facturing, successfully negotiated equal pay for equal work. Within the Big
###### Three, Local 199 in St. Catharines was one of a number of locals who regu¬
larly raised the issue at the council, warning in June, 1942, that “unless the
###### union is able to give leadership to the struggle for equal pay for equal work
we will remain weak among the women.”

###### The first strike of Ford Canada workers centred around the concern that
Ford would replace men with lower-paid women. The union’s demand was
###### not to oppose the hiring of women, but to insist that they earn the same
wages. Ford Canada’s eventual response was that hiring women was worth¬
while only if they were cheaper, and it refused to hire women at its assembly
###### plants until 1977. Although the union leadership did raise the issue of equal
pay with the broader public, the union did not launch a campaign to chal¬
lenge Ford when it stopped hiring women in Canada. In the U.S., on the
###### other hand, Ford was a major employer of women. This discrepancy may have stemmed from the differing structures of the company in the U.S. and in Canada. Whereas the Canadian operations were heavily weighted to
assembly, the U.S. operations included an extensive parts manufacturing
###### sector that could absorb lower-paid women workers.
 After the war, many of these women, especially those who were married,
were quite effectively returned to the kitchen. This trend was a matter of
###### both company and government policy, reflected not only in lay-off policy but also in the closing of the extensive child-care centres that had been set
up during the war. Yet women’s return to the home also had a wide base of
support amongst male and even female workers. There were isolated exam¬
ples of resistance on the part of women, but as Pam Sugiman commented in

Labour’s Dilemma, her study of women in the Canadian UAW, the more
###### common occurrence in the immediate postwar period was that “Married
women disappeared as quietly and unassumingly as they had appeared in the
###### auto plants.”

Women’s exposure to the world of work during the war did, however,

 attitudes that were more sympathetic to women’s role in the workforce.
 The story of women in the workforce during and after the war years con¬
trasts in significant ways with the experience of black workers in the United
###### States. The labour shortage and the relatively high wages in Detroit had attracted southern whites and blacks to Detroit. Racism against blacks was
intense in spite of efforts by the UAW leadership to limit it: 100,000 person-
days of wildcats occurred when whites (often but not always from the
###### South) refused to work alongside blacks. The racism culminated in the hor¬
ror of the Detroit race riots in the summer of 1943, when thirty-four people
were killed. Yet, after the war, blacks, unlike women, remained a significant
###### part of the auto workforce

###### Black Workers

Little research has been done on black workers within the Canadian autc
industry. There is little record of the kind of violently racist response that
occurred in Detroit during the war, but that was fundamentally related to
the small numbers of blacks then in Canada and the fact that social
breakthrough into well-paying auto jobs hadn’t yet started.

The main settlements of Canadian blacks were in Nova Scotia, where
blacks came as part of the “loyalists” leaving the United States after the
American revolution. While these settlements were far from the Ontario-
based auto industry, GM recruited a few blacks from Nova Scotia along
with a larger number from Toronto in the late thirties. They were hired in
the St. Catharines foundry where the work was the hardest, dirtiest and
most damaging to health. White workers generally avoided these jobs but
those who had no choice regularly collapsed from the heat. Part of the
rationale for recruiting blacks was the racist view that, being from Africa,
they could better stand the heat. By the late forties, some blacks worked in
St. Catharines. There were no blacks hired in Oshawa.

###### Another major settlement for blacks was Amherstburg, an end-point to
the underground railway bringing escaped slaves to freedom. Yet even
though Amherstburg was so close to Windsor, and even though tens of
thousands of blacks were hired in Detroit, Chrysler didn’t hire black
production workers until after the war. That only changed after they lost a
###### human rights case in 1946, initiated by the Canadian UAW and others in
the labour movement and civil rights community. Ford, the largest private
employer in Windsor, hired Chinese workers during the war as well as a
few blacks. Again this was linked to the foundry and the worst jobs.

###### The difference, it seems, was that the role of blacks as paid workers was¬
n’t generally challenged; the fight was over some white workers insisting
###### that blacks be segregated. With women, on the other hand, it was their role

as permanent paid workers that was not yet accepted. The truth was that
###### the equality of women in the workplace could not be achieved unless the union addressed the broader role of women in the family and in society. As
long as it was generally assumed that the role of women was primarily in the
###### home, their role in the war would be viewed as temporary regardless of the rhetoric. Men might join in the fight for equal pay because they recognized

rights (at least in the short run
###### when solidarity is not an issue). Indicative of these assump-
tions about the place of women in society was the role of the women’s auxil¬
iaries, organizations of wives of autoworkers established to assist the men in

group in either Canada or the United States, was established before the

1937 strike began. These auxiliaries quickly spread throughout the union.

sciousness developed in the seventies and eighties, the membership of the
auxiliaries correspondingly declined, especially amongst younger women.

###### When the war ended and lay-offs replaced labour shortages, the prevail¬
ing assumption that women’s real role was in the home directly led to sepa¬
###### rate seniority lists. Even the fight for equal pay, as long as it was about equal¬
ity in the abstract, rather than the pay of workers who were truly equal,
###### would not attract the kind of commitment and mobilization needed to change the existing pay structures. Working women had not yet developed their own self-confidence and were not yet in a position to build on the experiences of the war to transform society’s (and their own) view of
women’s role. They had little or no supportive resources inside or outside
###### the union. The Women’s Bureau, for example, was in Detroit and itself had limited resources. Changes occurred, but they came slowly and not before the notion of a broader women’s movement was on the agenda.

 The No-Strike Pledge

Before the war, equipment was sitting idle and skills and ideas were wasted.
###### Suddenly the war demonstrated that productive capacities and formerly unskilled labour could be transformed to suit virtually any need. The car companies made military vehicles, armoured vehicles, tank hulls, Browning machine guns, naval gun mounts, automatic rifles, engines for the vehicles, and fuselages for airplanes. Ford’s Windsor plant was the largest supplier of
military vehicles in the British Empire. Massey-Harris manufactured shells
###### and airplane wings. Early on in the war, de Fiavilland Aircraft, with an allo¬ cated workforce but no parts for planes, had the workers make toys and
socks. Since war production could not be left to the market, a level of plan¬
###### ning was necessary; the government had to closely supervise quality control and the allocation of production to ensure that the right demands were met according to plan. Plant closures couldn’t be tolerated.

These accommodations eventually raised a series of questions: If we can plan

merit, why can’t the peacetime needs of our citizens have the same result? By
1943, after the war clearly shifted in favour of the Allies, people began to
###### think about the postwar world. How do we avoid another depression? How
do we apply what we learned during the war to organizing our economy?

People questioned whose interests were being served by the structure of
economic decision making and power. In the first days of the war, citizens
###### patiently accepted the government’s calls for sacrifices. But the calls for sac¬
rifices also raised the issue of equality of sacrifice, and as the war went on, it
became all too clear that wage controls worked much more effectively than
price controls. The corporations could be conscripted into enforcing the
limits on wages but controls on profits did not seem to work at all, especially
after conversion to military production had been successfully implemented.

###### Central to such debates was the govern¬

of war supplies and equipment. Although workers overwhelmingly support¬
ed the war and were generally very reluctant to interfere with production,
they had their own grievances and demands, which had disruptive potential.
###### The governments of both Canada and the United States responded with a
call on labour to accept a no-strike pledge, which was eventually supported

by wage controls and legislation that delayed or prevented strikes. Given
###### that the industrial unions were still in their formative stages and given the
significance of the strike as a weapon for workers, the response of the unions
###### to the no-strike pledge could potentially have a profound effect on union
philosophies, attitudes, structures, and internal politics.

###### CIO affiliates union security in exchange for no-strike pledges. Weekend
work without premium pay was also demanded. The unions accepted. A spe¬
cial convention of the UAW in April confirmed the CIO patriotic pledge,
formally including the Canadian UAW. But at a subsequent meeting of the
###### Canadian Council, delegates refused to go along with their parent organiza¬
tion. The different responses in the two countries primarily reflected the dis¬
###### tinct stages of the two labour movements and the contrasting legislative context each faced.

By the spring of 1941, after the decisive victory at Ford, the UAW had
###### organized all the major auto companies in the U.S. and made major
advances in aerospace and agricultural implements. Furthermore, and unlike

its Canadian section, the American UAW had already obtained legislative
###### protection. The additional union security offered by the government stipu¬
lated that workers who did not opt out within fifteen days of signing a con¬
###### tract would have to stay in the union and pay union dues (by a dues check¬
off). The government also established special labour boards to deal with any

###### The UAW was walking the fine line between building the union’s base
and trying to limit the actions of that base. It had developed impressive edu¬
###### cational materials and structures; it lobbied for creative national initiatives that would address both the war effort and domestic needs; and some leaders (the Reuthers, and especially Emil Mazey, the militant and popular presi¬ dent of the Briggs plant who was to become secretary-treasurer of the UAW in 1947) were less than enthusiastic in their support of the no-strike pledge. In terms of membership growth, experience seemed to justify the American
UAW’s acceptance of the no-strike pledge. By late 1943, UAW membership
###### exceeded one million members (one-third more than the membership had
fifty years later).

###### Significant sections of the membership were however, increasingly ready to take militant action despite the union’s no-strike pledge. These groups included not only those workers opposed to the pledge because of the nega¬
tive impact on the union, but also many workers who, hired as a result of
###### the war, were new to the industry. While the activists of the thirties had
focused on building the union, these new workers voiced other concerns.
###### They were simply frustrated at the wage controls which kept wages far behind inflation, impatient with the company procedures for dealing with
(or ignoring) their workplace grievances, and angry at the record profits the
###### corporations were making from the war effort. In 1944, there were more
strikes — most of them unauthorized — than in any year in American his¬
tory, including the sit-down year of 1937; almost half of all union workers
###### participated in a work stoppage that year.
 The union’s involvement in the no-strike pledge created a potentially
dangerous gap between the membership and the leadership. The union was
###### now in the position of disciplining, or at least pressuring, its members to “be
more responsible” rather than leading them. The leadership’s retreat from
###### the strike weapon and the subsequent emphasis on technical presentations
to government boards increasingly shifted the emphasis of the union away
from worker mobilization towards centralization and professionalization.

###### The Canadian and American situations were fundamentally different. Until 1944, late in the war, Canadian workers were never offered legislated union security. During the war, the Canadian Manufacturers’ Association (CMA) went so far as to argue that industrial unions be banned and that CIO organizers be jailed. Without effective legislation guaranteeing the right to bargain, the Canadian unions had little difficulty rejecting a formal no-strike pledge. Moreover, since the Canadian CIO unions were still orga-


-----

nizing their sectors, their strikes were recognition strikes — the primary
demand was for the basic democratic right of representation. Patriotism in
this context didn’t pressure workers to be more responsible; it challenged
###### the undemocratic nature of the companies and the government.

In Canada, the union’s top leaders were therefore actively working with
###### the locals to mobilize and build the union. Since the government was
directly involved in limiting wages and strikes, Canadian Council meetings
###### directed attention to lobbying and challenging the government as well as the employers. And so, as the union grew, different relationships than in the
U.S. developed between the members and their leadership, and between the
###### union and the government. The Canadians’ goal was not radical: they sim¬
ply wanted the legislation the Americans had already won. Having to fight
for it in the special context of a war economy, when the workers had some
shop-floor strength, resulted in the development of confidence and indepen¬
dence. That drive extended to the Canadians also taking political action
outside the mainstream parties — whether directly through demonstrations
and lobbying or by way of a third party.

###### The different positions on the no-strike pledge taken by the Canadian
and American sections of the UAW can’t be understood apart from the dif¬
###### ferent positions also taken by the communist trade unionists in each coun¬

try. In both countries, the communists played a vital role in the develop¬
###### ment of industrial unionism in the mid-thirties. In addition to their own commitment and organizational skills, they also brought in activists from
outside the labour movement, building a unique relationship between intel¬
lectuals and workers that developed mutual understanding. At the end of
###### the thirties, communists were part of the alliance — along with social
democrats such as the Reuthers and other militants — that fought to keep
###### the union independent, democratic, and based on a strong shop-floor pres¬
ence. This alliance was responsible for the ousting of Homer Martin in the
U.S. and Charles Millard in Canada.

###### When the war started, the CP declared itself to be the organized opposi¬ tion to the war and claimed that there was no difference between the sides involved in the European conflict. Then, in the summer of 1941, after Hitler invaded the Soviet Union, the CP abruptly changed its tune, becom¬
ing “red, white, and blue.” In the United States, not only did the commu¬
nists endorse the no-strike pledge but they showed their support with a pas¬
sionate and ultimately self-destructive enthusiasm. The CP referred to strik¬
ing workers as scabs against the war effort and attacked the UAW leadership

for not being aggressive enough in disciplining workers. It even went
beyond the no-strike pledge, calling for incentive pay to increase productiv¬
ity. The attempt to reinstate the piece-rate system, which workers had
fought so hard to eliminate, turned out to be political suicide.

To top it off, the leadership of the American CP turned to American
###### exceptionalism — arguing that class conflict no longer applied to the United States and that cooperation with business and government should continue even after the war. This latter change in direction led to a split in the American CP, the ouster of its leader, and a temporary discontinuance of the party.
 The patriotic zeal of the CP and its move to the right did, it seems,
appeal to some American workers. But these factors inevitably weakened
and destroyed the credibility the CP had amongst activists. Their vision of
building a new society might have kept the communists themselves going,
but other activists were primarily interested not in their philosophy but in
###### their militant daily actions. Now the communists were undercutting their
own reputation for militancy. As it turned out, the CP’s new-found and
###### extreme Americanism didn’t prevent it from being red-baited, but it did undermine the party as a force in the UAW before McCarthyism and the
cold war finished it off.

###### The Canadian CP, tied to the Soviet CP rather than the American CP, did not show the same enthusiasm for a new era of cooperation with
employers as its American counterpart. It did support the no-strike pledge,
and some communist trade unionists, such as those at Massey-Harris, fol¬
lowed suit. But unlike those in the U.S., many communist trade unionists in
###### Canada, especially in the UAW, refused to follow the party line. This resis¬ tance reflected, in part, the more general opposition within Canada to such

a pledge when the trade union rights had not been recognized. It also
reflected the unique position of communists within the Canadian UAW.

###### Alone amongst virtually all major labour unions in North America, the CP in the UAW was neither marginal nor dominant. It was neither so weak that it could be kicked out nor so in control that the Canadian UAW could
be isolated as a “red” union. In the Canadian UAW there was a close work¬
ing relationship between communists, leftist members of the CCF, and unaf¬
###### filiated militants. And there was a relative balance between these groups
and right-wing CCF members and anti-communists. That alliance and bal¬
ance changed how the communists operated within the union; they refused
to risk their effective relationships by following the party line. In addition,


-----

###### this dynamic preserved an organized and credible left in the union which
affected the future UAW culture in Canada.

George Burt, the director of the UAW in Canada, reflected that balance.
He was often criticized for drifting with the wind; he supported the left
###### when it was the dominant faction in the union during the war and shifted towards the Reuther supporters when they became ascendant. But this
weakness in choosing sides was also, from the perspective of the union’s
future, a strength. Burt avoided factional infighting, and, without prevent-
ing ongoing disagreements and debates about direction, he concentrated the
union’s efforts on fighting common enemies, building the membership, and
###### strengthening the organization.

Alongside the different union responses in the two countries to the no-
strike pledge was a more general difference in the changing political mood
###### and directions. Politically, the U.S. shifted to the right, while Canada
moved to the centre-left. In the U.S., the Roosevelt New Deal faded, while
in Canada the CCF, a new political party with growing links to the labour
###### movement, emerged.
 In the U.S., Roosevelt’s popularity had begun to fall after the recession that started in late 1937. Within labour, the AFL, fighting back against the CIO, was offering companies sweetheart deals to keep CIO unions out, while
opposing progressive labour and social legislation, which the AFL believed
would strengthen the CIO. Furthermore, with the outbreak of war and the
###### return to full production, criticism of the corporations had abated in the United States. In Canada, however, both major parties had lost credibility
during the depression. The extremely hard line against unions and the dis¬
###### ruptions caused by strikes for simple recognition left unions with a measure of public support. In addition, since Canada entered the war before the Americans, Canadians experienced the contradictions of the wartime econo¬
my earlier, and resistance to the inequality of sacrifice came sooner.

###### In the February, 1942, federal by-election, the Conservative Party, with
its very conservative leader, Arthur Meighen, lost to the CCF. The shock
led the Conservatives to move their platform to the centre-left and absorb
###### into their official name the word “Progressive” from Manitoba’s Progressive
Party of Farmers, which the new Conservative leader, John Bracken, had led
###### since 1920. By 1943, the CCF’s momentum had the establishment truly concerned. The CCF had come within a whisker of winning the 1943 Ontario election and the elected MPPs included the heads of the United
Steelworkers of America (Charles Millard) and the International Union of


-----

###### Mine Mill and Smelter Workers (Robert Carlin). In elections in British
Columbia and Saskatchewan, the CCF came in second.

###### A month after the Ontario election, the CCF was in first place in a national poll (twenty-nine per cent compared to twenty-eight per cent for
each of the Liberals and Conservatives). In a 1943 by-election in Montreal,
###### the contest was actually between the communists and the CCF, with Fred
Rose (CP) defeating David Lewis (CCF) for the seat. With the record strike
wave in 1943 and the shift to the left in the popular mood, the Liberal gov¬
###### ernment eventually adopted more progressive legislation such as family allowances and union rights to regain control over the pace of change, undermine the CCF support, and preserve their own future.
 Once the government had conceded on the labour legislation, the
UAW’s Canadian Council resolved, in April, 1944, to limit its strike activi¬

ty. The union was concerned about jeopardizing the permanence of the leg¬
islation as the war drew to a close. Over the next year, strikes were down,
and the union turned its attention to a lobbying campaign to “Win the
Peace”. The emphasis was on implementing economic conversion, changing
###### the labour code that unions would face after the war, achieving the forty- hour week plus extended paid vacations, and developing national social
security plans.

###### This strike truce was, however, short-lived. When the war ended, Canadian workers acted quickly to build on the union recognition that they had won at the government level and to persuade employers to agree to union security. The momentum from that fight carried the union to a major national wage offensive.

 The Day Ford Saw Too Many Cars

 The fight for union security was the bridge between the end of the war and the beginning of the postwar period. At the height of the war (1943), 1.2 million Canadians were employed in the defence industries. By August,

1945, this workforce had been cut in half, while 50,000 soldiers were return¬
ing each month to the civilian workforce. For the UAW and others in the
###### Canadian labour movement, the key threats after the war were the possible return of high unemployment and the concentration of corporate power, which threatened democracy. Labour’s response included plans for postwar conversion that involved input from working people and wage increases to

###### The final step in this process of securing trade union stability occurred when companies accepted union security clauses. These clauses had already been negotiated amongst major American companies and enforced by the American government in exchange for the no-strike pledge. But they were
rare in Canada. The Canadian confrontation over this issue took place at

Ford’s Windsor operations — then Canada’s largest manufacturing establish¬
###### ment.

By 1944, Ford employed 14,000 production workers who were anxious to
address their grievances, including union security, by going on strike. But
###### they wanted to avoid an all-out strike during the war at this crucial plant. Ford had never fully accepted the union, and there were mini-strikes between 1942 and 1944 over speed-up and the firing of union militants, as
well as over equal pay for women. The union had, from the day of its first

ble we have an election of sub-stewards to carry our gospel into the plant
and so far we have elected 367 sub-stewards. [Note: sixty-four of these were
company-recognized stewards].”

###### There was little or no concern that establishing union security might
undermine the union by freeing stewards from direct contact with each mem¬
ber in collecting dues, and that the steady dues might give the leaders too
much autonomy from the members. There was overwhelming consensus in
three areas: the financial base provided by of a dues check-off was crucial to the
union’s survival, the union needed to devote its time to activities other than
collecting dues, and the lack of union security constantly provided the compa¬
ny with opportunities to divide the membership and even destroy the union
when tough times recurred. The issue was therefore never whether to fight for
the dues check-off but how to replace the loss in membership contact.

###### The union had previously been successful in persuading conciliation
boards to recommend union security, but the companies generally ignored
these nonbinding recommendations. Before and after the strike began, the
###### union — confident that the ruling would be favourable — suggested resolv¬
ing the issue of union security by way of binding arbitration. The company
refused, and the strike dragged on.

###### After five weeks on the picket line, the union moved to escalate the
strike by preventing the non-union security guards from entering the plant.
###### When the police tried to escort them in, thousands of pickets blocked the path. The province looked to the federal government to send in the RCMP, and in anticipation of that assault, one of the most dramatic events in Canadian labour history occurred.

First, the Local 195 leadership, generally led by the left, decided to hold
a sympathy strike with the Ford workers. The international executive board
###### of the union did not support this tactic, but the Canadian director, George
Burt, supported the Windsor local (though he opposed its call to shut down
all Canadian UAW plants). The response of the Local 195 membership was
###### remarkable: the local included workers at GM, two dozen components plants, a few miscellaneous manufacturing firms, and 3,600 members at the Chrysler plant. These workers shut down their own operations and joined the Ford picket lines, and then, at a time when the union provided no strike

pay, they demonstrated their solidarity with the Ford workers by refusing to
###### return to work for almost one month.
 The sympathy strike began on 5 November 1945, and later that day, the union acted to block any police or RCMP action. The workers chose the
same strategy the Ford River Rouge workers had used in the U.S. in 1941: a
car blockade. The event was planned by strike leaders with participation
from the national office, though carrying it out involved creative and spon¬
###### taneous intervention by many rank-and-file workers. Roughly 8,000 Ford
workers participated in the protest with the help of 6,000 members from
Local 195. Workers brought not only their own cars to the Ford plant, but
also trapped over 1,000 cars and twenty-five street buses (some estimates
ranged up to 1,500 vehicles) that were — willingly or unwillingly — caught
in the traffic. The blockade, in which workers defended their strike with
###### products they themselves produced, covered twenty blocks. The union had prevented a yiolent confrontation, and negotiations resumed.
 The strike had strong support within the community. The mayor
promised to pay welfare to any family in need (though a conservative major-


-----

ity within the city council soon reversed this pledge). Small business in the
community took out a newspaper ad supporting the strikers. Church groups
backed the strike, and some even joined picket lines. Especially militant in
###### their support were the young soldiers recently back from the front lines.
Rallies took place across the country with the city of Windsor alone bring¬
ing 15,000 supporters together. UAW locals in Sarnia and Brantford stopped
work in a day of solidarity, and other UAW locals in St. Catharines and
###### Oshawa took votes of support for any action they were called on to do. American locals sent financial support. Workers in Fort William and Ottawa expressed their clear support, as did mineworkers from Nova Scotia,
rubberworkers from Kitchener, and steelworkers from Hamilton.

###### The leaders of the Canadian labour movement were, however, divided in their attitudes to the strike and in their choices over strategy. Without their united support, a more general national work stoppage wasn’t possible. From then on, with the workers’ actions having peaked, the strategy of Ford and the provincial and federal governments became simply waiting the strikers
out. Towards the end of November, the parties reached a compromise. Ford
wasn’t ready to give in to union security, but if the workers returned to work,
Ford would accept the union’s original offer of binding arbitration. The
###### committee was divided, but George Burt and most of the committee mem¬
bers favoured ending the strike.

Fifty-two per cent of the members, however, rejected that recommenda¬
tion. Tom McLean, even though he was Burt’s assistant, voiced his strong
###### opposition to the compromise at the membership meeting, and sufficient
numbers agreed. He reasoned that the workers couldn’t trust an arbitrator
and had to win this fight on the picket line. (Others argued that McLean
should be fired for his insubordination but Burt never pressed the issue.)

However, with no way to escalate the fight and with the members and
###### the leadership split over ending the strike, the membership had few
options. Two weeks later, the union held another vote on essentially the
same offer, with the added understanding that the arbitrator would be sym¬
###### pathetic to the union. The committee, including Tom McLean, was satis¬
fied, and of the 6,000 workers who voted, seventy-two per cent were in
favour of ending the strike. Justice Ivan Rand was appointed arbitrator, and
his decision endorsed full union dues check-off, even for those workers who
chose to stay out of the union. Justice Rand essentially argued that since all
###### employees benefited from union struggles and union representation, all
workers should pay their share

The Ford strike at Windsor, Ont is still in progress and at the moment there is no prospect
of a settlement. The Management of the Ford Motor Company still refuses to grant the
demands of the Union.

With the strike now in its ninth week, the United Automobile Workers of America (CIO)
is faced with a heavy burden in the feeding and maintenance of many of its members. It is
estimated that the union is now feeding over nine thousand persons, and the expectation is that
this number will increase. It will, therefore, be seen that in order to maintain a fighting position
on hehalf of its membership, the union must have greater support as soon as possible.

Funds are urgently needed, and it is absolutely essential that every member of our Brother¬
hood appreciate the nature of the fight being waged by the workers of the Ford Company. This
fight is the fight of every member of the labour movement. It is the front line fight of all work¬
ing men to maintain present wage levels, with reduced hours so as to maintain full employment.
To lose this fight would be a serious blow to every member of our Brotherhood.

You are urged to give, and give generously so that this most important fight may
be won on behalf of Labour.

This ruling was very rapidly applied to UAW agreements that followed. By
the end of 1946, twenty-three other agreements in Windsor, including those
at Chrysler, contained the Rand formula, and GM conceded in 1947. It was
soon common across all regions and sectors. In the late-seventies, Quebec leg¬
islated the Rand formula; in the early eighties, Ontario followed suit.

###### This strike against the largest employer in Canada, in the critical early
period after the war, was a national event, and its outcome was clearly a vic¬
tory for Canadian workers. But that victory also had an explicit price tag. In
exchange for union security, Justice Rand established a new responsibility
for the union: policing wildcats. This bargaining followed the pattern of the
###### Roosevelt wartime offer of union security, which included a no-strike
pledge, and it expanded on the new Canadian labour legislation which gave
workers the right to have a union but prohibited work stoppages during the
agreement’s term. Rand went one step further; the union’s responsibility was

on wildcat strikes could face fines and lose years of seniority in proportion to
###### the length of time they illegally stopped work, while the union could lose its
dues check-off for up to six months.

In the United States, although the UAW seemed divided between a
communist-supported group and the emerging Reuther group, the tradition¬
al left-right identifications lost most of their meaning during the war. One
result of the consensus on the no-strike pledge within the United States was
###### that neither group mobilized the growing frustrations of the membership. This lack of cohesiveness became evident at the 1944 special UAW conven¬ tion on the war, when a significant minority of delegates refused to go along with the proposals of either caucus. It was also expressed more generally in the unauthorized strike wave of 1944. As the war came to an end, the American UAW seemed to be in chaos, and strategy at headquarters was
geared to reestablishing a measure of control. Victor Reuther, in an inter¬
view cited in Eric Mann’s Taking on General Motors, later commented on the
###### thinking behind the first significant postwar strike in the union: “The GM
strike was designed to take the ball out of the hands of stewards and com¬
###### mitteemen ... and put it in the hands of the national leadership.”
 The Canadians experienced their own disappointments and divisions
during this period, but the leadership’s relationship with its members was
###### maintained and strengthened. The concentration of the industry in south¬
ern Ontario provided the union with the potential for cohesiveness, but the
###### development of this potential rested on a more profound worker-built base

already down. In contrast, the war made organizing difficult because the
###### threat of disrupting production, and therefore the war effort, carried so much
weight that governments placed severe limits on strikes and walk-outs.

ging behind its American counterpart in numbers, strength, supportive leg¬

Along with the rest of Canadian labour, the union essentially caught up to the New Deal reforms won earlier in the United States. While these reforms came later to the Canadians, they also provided a momentum heading into the postwar period that the Americans had lost.
 The war and its aftermath established union recognition for the Canadian UAW from both the state, through the legislation of collective bargaining rights, and employers, through union security clauses won by direct action. In spite of internal conflicts, the struggles and mobilizations that led to this achievement left the Canadian UAW relatively healthy and confident as it prepared to address the next stage of its development.

 Delivering the Goods

What made the prospect [of unionization] seem

especially grim in those early years was the persistent

union attempt to invade management prerogatives ...

workers’ grievances with union representatives, and to

submit for arbitration the few grievances that remain

unsettled. But on the whole we have retained all the

basic powers to manage.

###### — Harvey Swados


-----

###### The UAW was born on the shop floor, out of struggles to limit manage¬
ment’s power to decide arbitrarily who worked and who didn’t, out of con¬
flicts over the pace and organization of work, and out of resentment over
###### arbitrary rules and daily harassments. The war, especially in the United
States, provided the transition to a focus on workers as consumers; that is,
###### on how workers live outside the workplace. For the American UAW, this
change came alongside two other transitions; one political, the other inter¬
nal. The war turned out to be a passage from the heady days of the New
Deal to the conservatism of the cold war. It was also a passage from a union
divided along ideological-factional lines and fragmented amongst strong and
###### independent locals, to a union that was highly centralized, both ideological¬

ly and administratively.

In this period, the UAW established its basic structures and direction, as
well as its reputation as an innovative leader in social unionism. The
###### Canadians played a secondary role in shaping these basic overall structures
(ninety-five per cent of the members and a higher proportion of the industry
were centred in the United States). But the Canadians did not simply inher¬
it the American system. The process by which the American UAW struc¬
ture and philosophy was translated to Canada involved both resistance and
###### attraction. The outcome, as the fifties came to an end, was a Canadian sec¬ tion that was the same but different.

 The Treaty of Detroit

From the beginning of the union in the thirties, the corporations’ main con¬
###### cern was to retain complete control over production. Forced to recognize
unions, the corporations insisted that the unions must also recognize man¬
###### agement. The companies would remove some of their arbitrary practices, but management rights — the right to hire, lay-off, invest, choose products,
schedule hours, and determine the methods, organization, and pace of pro¬
###### duction — would be written into the agreements and enforced by both the
company and the union.

During the war, full production had allowed workers to resist this unilat¬
eral management power on the shop floor, and this resistance often created
tensions with the top leadership of the union. But in the United States, the
more lasting development of the war was the establishment, through gov¬
###### ernment initiatives of grievance procedures and arbitration boards to chan-


-----

###### nel workers frustrations away from direct action. Once the war was over, companies were more determined than ever to restore any management rights and control they had lost to workers and stewards during the war. Walter Reuther, who became head of the UAW’s GM department in 1939, challenged the company’s pricing policy in 1946 and insisted that workers and the public had a right to influence it. The management endured a 113-
day strike to assert that it would not relinquish management rights either in
###### the workplace (dealing with workers) or outside (issues of pricing, products, and investment). And GM won.

Immediately after the GM agreement was signed, large numbers of work¬
ers walked off the job to join demonstrations against the attack on labour
###### launched by the Taft-Hartley Act. The act was introduced in 1947 to weaken
labour, particularly its ability to engage in solidaristic actions. While making
it easier for management to interfere in organizing drives, it reinstituted
###### injunctions, outlawed mass and secondary picketing, and encouraged states to ban “union shops.” It also denied services and legislative rights to any union whose leaders didn’t sign affidavits rejecting support for or belief in
communism. This denial proved to be the most divisive aspect of the act and
was instrumental in undermining labour’s overall attack on the legislation.

###### In response to the worker demonstrations during working hours, GM
fired local leaders and activists and then entered into negotiations with the
###### union over reducing some of the penalties. This tactic, of firing militants and putting the union on the defensive to bring the workers back, quickly developed into a basic corporate strategy for dealing with militancy; Ford and later Chrysler adopted its use. The companies were reinforced by the conservative times, the new labour legislation, and the backing from the
labour boards and the courts. Workers were intimidated and the negotiated
compromises, reinforced by the trade-off inherent in judgements like the
###### Rand decision, committed the union to limiting further occurrences.

But as in the thirties, discipline was not enough. Stability would require
###### both channelling union energy elsewhere and showing that there were spe¬
cific benefits for workers if they moderated shop-floor militancy. In 1948,
###### GM offered, and the union accepted, a quarterly cost-of-living allowance (COLA) over and above the wage increase, in exchange for a two-year agreement. The company hoped this term would lead to greater workplace
stability. (Previous agreements were for only one year.) This turn of events
set the stage for the 1950 agreement, which Fortune dubbed the “Treaty of
###### Detroit ”


-----

###### The 1950 bargaining round with GM represented the most systematic attempt by both sides to shape a coherent and stable relationship. The com'
pany wanted a five-year agreement so it could plan production without con¬
###### cern over a national walk-out every year or two. In addition, it especially wanted to consolidate management rights and remove them from the

union’s bargaining agenda.

###### each year of work, there is an additional year in which to exercise the right
to recall if the company is hiring).

###### The subheading on Fortune's analysis of the agreement read, “GM Paid a
Billion for Peace. It Got a Bargain.” Although workers rebelled in 1953 and
forced a wage reopener, the principles behind the 1950 agreement, especial¬

ly that of longer-term agreements as three years became the norm, remained
###### intact. GM president Alfred P. Sloan, looking back from the vantage point
of the early sixties, observed in My Years With General Motors:


-----

###### At the time I write this, it is more than seventeen years
since there has been an extended strike over national issues
###### at General Motors. To those of us who recall ... the thirties

... [this] record is almost incredible. And we have achieved
###### this record without surrendering any of the basic responsi¬
bilities of management ... The issue of unionism at General
Motors is long since settled.

###### In the mid-fifties a new wave of technology that integrated procedures
developed during the war swept the industry. The trend was called “automa¬
###### tion,” and its introduction raised fears about replacing and changing exist¬
ing jobs. The restructuring inside the plants was used to further reinforce
###### management control and tighten production standards.
 There was ongoing worker resistance to some of the changes. In
response, the UAW tried to initiate a national debate on the social implica¬
###### tions of new technology. Walter Reuther, in a pamphlet in the early fifties on the wide-ranging implications of automation, wrote that

 An important step towards minimizing the potential social dislocations during the coming decades ... would be the reduction in the length of the workweek ... The reduction
in the workweek to 35 or 30 hours in the coming decade
###### can be an important shock absorber during the transition to the widespread use of automation.

 The union, however, subsequently shifted its response to income security and sharing the fruits of the technology rather than influencing the imple¬ mentation or role of automation in the workplace. A total rejection of

###### PATTERN BARGAINING

In a relatively short period of time, the UAW and the companies had
developed a tightly-conceived bargaining system and strategy referred to as
“pattern bargaining.” It was this strategy, as much as anything else, that
reinforced and legitimated the centralized structure of the union and was
generally credited for the UAW’s collective bargaining successes. This
strategy was put in place in the U.S. in 1950, with the Treaty of Detroit.
Canada didn’t completely follow suit until the late fifties.

###### Sectoral Bargaining

Postwar talk of a pattern for all the CIO unions died quickly. The UAW
based its strategy on establishing a pattern at the Big Three. One company
was targeted, while the others were left waiting. Striking only one company
at a time, and threatening it with a loss in market share to the others, put
competitive pressures on the target while also minimizing damage to the
overall economy (especially if imports were low). Once an agreement was
established, it was taken to the other major companies and copied in detail.
###### Then it was extended with some inevitable flexibility in smaller units — to
the parts industry, aerospace, and agricultural implements.

###### Focus on Economics

The content of national bargaining focused on economic issues; these
united the membership around common demands. Issues related to working
conditions and work environment were negotiated locally. In the U.S.,
workers had the right to strike during the agreement’s life over certain
issues not specified in the collective agreement (production standards and
###### health and safety) but these were also centralized in the sense that they
required the prior approval of the international office in Detroit.

###### Long-Term Agreements

The original plan was for a five-year agreement, but after the members
rebelled, the union moved to the three-year agreement of today. That
longer agreement gave the union a chance to focus on other issues and
agreements outside the Big Three, but it necessitated some provision for
security against economic changes during the terms of that agreement.


-----

###### Real Wages

 At the core of the wage agreement were two principles: the right to share in technology/productivity, and protection against the erosion of wages to inflation. This formula seems to have first come from GM, though it was clearly a response to the militancy and expectations of its workers. The “right to share” led to the provision of an AIF tied not to the company, but to general trends in the economy. If the companies did better than that, which they normally did, they could use the excess for their own purposes
or, as the union argued, increase benefits to workers and distribute it to
###### consumers in the form of lower prices.
 Cost'ofdiving bonuses were first introduced during the War to limit the growing resistance to wage controls. Similarly, COLA, like the AIF, supported the union argument that workers were not to blame for inflation: COLA provided quarterly protection against inflation (only)
after prices went up. The COLA originally represented 100 per cent
###### protection against inflation (under ninety per cent today) and it is linked to other forms of pay — when workers work shifts or overtime, and get vacation or holiday pay, the COLA is added on and treated as part of regular pay.

 Wage Differentials

 The union-negotiated pay structure within each of the Big Three is relatively egalitarian (i.e., relative to other countries and other industries). Janitors get about 5 per cent less than assemblers and skilled workers get about twenty per cent above assemblers. The AIF was briefly a fixed amount but quickly (it took longer in Canada) became a percentage increase. COLA (which has generated about two-thirds of wages since the end of the forties) remains the same for all workers and therefore represents a higher percentage for lower-paid workers. If the wage structure should get out of line with community standards for skilled workers, special additional increases are negotiated for the trades (i.e., the structure is biased to pinch differentials but there is flexibility in the system).
 When auto was first organized, women were either excluded from auto jobs or segregated into certain departments. But even when doing the same job, their wages were significantly lower. Such differentials for doing the same work did not disappear until the end of the fifties.


-----

###### Paid Time Off

In both countries, the government introduced the principle of one-week
vacations during the war. The union introduced paid holidays in the late
forties and extended the paid vacation time in the fifties. While a standard
demand of the union from its very beginnings, the union never made a
pattern breakthrough beyond the forty-hour workweek.

###### Company'Paid Benefits

The costs of benefits (health care, income protection, pensions) were at
first divided equally between the companies and the workers, but fully paid
company plans became the general pattern on both sides of the border by
the early sixties. Benefits like pensions (negotiated in 1950) and income
security (negotiated in 1955) were integrated to government plans to make
them both less expensive and more rational.

###### Pensions

The pension plans were based on a defined benefit per year of service and
supported by a fund supervised, but not controlled, by the union.
Improvements were negotiated during each round of bargaining and these
included improvements for those already retired and not part of the
workforce. Over time, the pension plans became more flexible and
complex with the addition of benefits like early retirement and survivor’s
options.

###### Income Security

In the debates over how to respond to automation in the mid-fifties, the
opposition pushed for a longer-term solution of reduced work-time, but
Walter Reuther channelled this demand into a program to achieve a
guaranteed annual income to overcome the short-term cyclical nature of
the industry. That program, which evolved into SUB (supplementary
employment benefits), provided a top-up for those laid off for a period of
time linked to seniority.

During the fifties and sixties, no name was more identifiable with social

 Walter Reuther was a first-generation American, the son of German
immigrants. He was born in 1907 in the industrial centre of Wheeling, West
Virginia, and, like his younger brothers Roy and Victor, he was clearly influ¬
###### enced by the commitment of his father to trade unionism and democratic
socialism. At nineteen, he moved to Detroit, where he was active in social¬
ist circles at work and at university, which he attended while he was a
###### diemaker at Ford. In the early thirties, he and Victor travelled through
Europe, visited China, and worked for eighteen months at an auto plant
###### near Gorki in the Soviet Union. They returned in 1935 to witness, and par¬ ticipate in, the birth of the UAW.
 Detroit was then seething with strikes and pressure from workers for recognition of elected stewards and the union In 1936 Walter went to the

crucial founding convention in South Bend, Indiana, and, confident and
###### articulate, he emerged as a member of the UAW’s executive board. He
quickly built a base as the president of the powerful amalgamated Local 174
on the west side of Detroit, and in 1939, he became head of the GM depart¬
###### ment. In 1946, Walter Reuther was elected president of the UAW.
 Reuther first attained national prominence during the war with his
detailed plan for industrywide conversion of automobile plants to airplane
###### production as a means for overcoming the early difficulties in moving to a
war economy. As the war came to an end, he grabbed public attention with
###### equally well-developed and well-publicized retooling and reconversion
plans. One idea Reuther presented was the setting up of commando units of
###### engineers, designers and skilled trades, to assist smaller firms in getting
access to the available pool of technology, knowledge, and expertise. After
###### the war, he gained notoriety by broadening the scope of union demands to
include corporate decisions affecting the public. In 1946, he called on the
###### automotive companies to open their books so their pricing policies could be challenged, and in 1949, he argued for the production of a fuel-efficient, nonpolluting, safe and affordable small car.
 The base for all of these gains was, of course, the UAW’s achievements in
bargaining. Led by Reuther, workers at the Big Three more than doubled
###### their wages in the fifteen years after the war — an increase of over one-third
after inflation. (To put this in perspective, hourly wages for American Big
###### Three workers have increased by less than three per cent after inflation in the fifteen years ending in 1995.) The UAW’s agreements with the compa¬
nies modestly increased paid time off, introduced company-paid health pro¬
###### tection for workers and their families, pioneered an income protection poli¬

cy to deal with lay-offs, and developed pension plans to allow workers to
retire comfortably. The UAW set the direction and standards for American,
and also Canadian, labour.

###### When Reuther was elected UAW president in 1946, it was by the slimmest
of majorities: less than one and one-half per cent. The executive board elect¬
ed at the same time was overwhelmingly loyal to his opposition. That opposi¬
###### tion was communist-led, and with the war over, the communists’ militant line
of the thirties had returned. The communists themselves made up a very small
###### proportion of this postwar left, which included various socialists and many
workers who were simply militant with no clear political orientation.

Reuther’s victory was closely linked to both his role as the head of the
GM department and the union’s first test after the war the 113 day strike


-----

###### at GM. From the perspective of the union’s stated goals, the strike was a defeat. But workers’ struggles, as Reuther then well understood, have a
logic that is both more straightforward and more complex than checking
off gains and losses. Workers were frustrated; they wanted someone to artic-
###### ulate that frustration publicly, and they were ready for a fight. Reuther
showed that he was ready to lead, and he was rewarded for that insight and
###### action.
 Reuther had positioned himself to steer a particular course through an
increasingly conservative America. Having preempted the media, business,
###### and the state from red-baiting the UAW by leading the attack on commu¬
nists himself, he tried to carve out a space that would achieve concrete gains
for the union’s members while simultaneously resurrecting the broader pro¬
gressive New Deal agenda that had faded in wartime. His underlying vision
was to build a progressive alliance, with the organized working class in the
lead, to win the material and liberating benefits of mass production and its
###### accelerating technology. For very powerful reasons, this strategy led him to
focus on democratizing consumption.

###### With the end of the war, the inevitable focus on material well-being dominated working class demands. For almost two continuous decades that included the deprivation of the depression and the disruption of the war, Americans and Canadians had made sacrifices. Now that they were on the winning side of the war, they wanted to share in the benefits and promises they were owed by that victory. The public longed for a normalcy most had
long forgotten or never known, and the people looked to their unions and
###### politicians to deliver it. In contrast to an emphasis on the workplace itself, the focus on compensating workers as consumers for selling their labour pre¬ sented, from Reuther’s perspective, three further advantages.

First, any focus on management rights would inherently shift power to
###### the locals, while Reuther was instead trying to centralize the union. Given the unevenness and sectionalism in the union, a decentralized strategy could fragment and weaken the union’s potential influence. For example, some locals might be strong enough to oppose management in the plants or win special wage gains, while others were not; some local battles might have their own logic but undermine broader strategic goals of the union as a whole; and workers were divided by race, ethnicity, and occupation. Reuther wanted to concentrate on those national issues that would mean common gains for all workers and would therefore unite the


-----

Second, a focus on increasing workers’ purchasing power and benefits
was a less radical demand since, unlike an emphasis on management rights,
it didn’t challenge private property rights. Rather, it channelled militancy
towards making gains within the system and was therefore less likely to iso¬
late the union. Moreover, this strategy could even be articulated as a pro¬
gressive weapon in the cold war: the most effective way to undercut commu¬
###### nist arguments was to show that America delivered on its promises of
greater benefits for all.

###### Third, and perhaps most important, it was becoming increasingly clear that fighting over management rights would mean an all-out battle with
very uncertain chances of success. American management emerged from the
war conscious of the profitable opportunities that lay ahead. Not only was
###### productive capacity back on its feet, but the war had also left companies with a backlog of technology and had expanded their assets, making them
hungry for new opportunities. Their primary concern was that they be free
to manage production — free, that is, from union interference.

Companies such as the Big Three didn’t expect to eliminate unions alto¬
gether. They had learned to live with the unions during the war and certain¬

ly didn’t want to risk reviving the battles of the thirties. Instead, companies
wanted a particular trade-off: “We’ll recognize you, but you have to recog¬
nize us, which means our right to manage and plan production with some
stability”. Reuther was fully aware of both America’s potential wealth and
###### the corporations’ fundamental desire for a measure of labour stability. He set
out to take maximum advantage of that situation.

###### The eighteen months following Reuther’s initial election saw an intensi¬ fication of the internal battle for control over the union that had, in one
form or another, dominated the union since its inception. Reuther came out
of this infighting as the undisputed leader of the union, winning reelection
in 1947 and sweeping his allies along as together they took eighteen of
twenty-two executive positions.

###### That triumph was the result of both successful organization and the exploitation of the increasingly anti-communist environment in America.
Even without a majority on the board, Reuther had been able to retain control
over the departments of education and communications — crucial areas in an
emerging organization. He combined this control with exciting ideas and plans

for the future direction of the union. But he also reinforced the red-baiting
###### that was seething in American society and used it to isolate both the left and
many of those who refused to “choose and denounce communists


-----

###### Once he had the levers of power, Reuther acted quickly and ruthlessly to
solidify his hold. Seventy-five staff members, as well as the head of the legal
###### department and dozens of support staff whose loyalty to Reuther was in question were fired. Many of these people had made vital contributions to the struggles of working people in the past and still had much to offer. (There was some attempt to justify the firings on grounds of “economy,” but
in the following decade, membership rose only fifteen per cent while the
###### number of staff members reached levels fifty-five per cent higher than those
before the mass firings.) With the staff under control, the next step was to
###### crush locals that remained under the leadership of either communists or
those labelled “communist sympathizers.” After 1949, the caucus was tight¬
###### ened and essentially became another instrument of Reuther’s executive
board.

###### Reuther then turned to the CIO, playing an active role in expelling unions which had democrati¬ cally chosen to retain its left

lenge the leadership on some issues, those
challenges could only be marginally effec¬
tive and certainly couldn’t be sustained without a coordinated opposition or
###### alternative mechanisms to give them weight. In spite of its later achieve¬
ments, the union paid dearly in the long term.

Victor Reuther, who headed the union’s education department at that
time, later captured one aspect of the implications in a 1986 interview cited

by Eric Mann in Taking on General Motors:

You know I am proud of... the accomplishments of what is
###### known as the Reuther years. But I am seeing one mistake
we made ... The administration caucus ... was maintained
many years after that battle was over. Essentially a great deal
###### of authority got concentrated at the top. The vehicle of the administration caucus is [now] used to prevent open debate
in the union.

###### The impressive success in gaining a share of the wealth for UAW mem¬
bers was not matched by the growth of the broad social alliance Reuther
###### had worked and hoped for. The main reason for this lack of growth was that the American labour movement would not move in any serious way to

lay the foundation for any permanent new politics. Reuther himself had, in
###### the early thirties, assumed that significant social change simply couldn’t happen without a socialist party based on the working class. In August,

for such an initiative; these divisions stemmed from competition between
###### the AFL and CIO and from right-left conflicts. Even more important, it
seems, was the fear of losing links with the Democratic Party and wandering
###### alone in the woods for an indefinite period.
 A poll in 1947 amongst CIO officials showed that a significant base
favoured setting up a labour party. One out of four officials wanted to create
a new party in the next two or three years, and half looked to the founding
###### of a new labour party within the next ten years. But confronted with the immediate choice between working towards such a party and risking the defeat of the Democrats in the upcoming election, the labour leadership
stayed with the Democrats. By the early fifties, the idea of a third party was,
for Reuther, dead and buried. At the Detroit Economic Club in 1953, he
###### stated: “I felt in 1932 ... that it [socialism] might be a better way to do
things. I have long stopped believing that Socialism is the answer.”

###### Reuther continued to place consumer-oriented demands on the bargain¬
ing table, arguing for union input into the price of cars, the responsiveness
###### of cars to the environment, and car safety. But this focus naturally brought the debate back to overall management rights. Companies were not going to concede at this level, having generally blocked the union’s challenge to


-----

management’s rights in the workplace. And the union could not force their
###### hand given that it had neither the support of a political movement to take on the companies, nor any prospect of making these issues a priority
amongst the membership. Workers could not be expected to fight over these
###### challenges with management since they had not been mobilized to fight management over more specific workplace issues.
 Reuther never stopped lobbying for more general benefits for all citizens; the UAW was a leading force within the United States for a national health
care plan and for the expansion of public pensions. But, unable to achieve
European-style social benefits, the union drifted towards establishing a “par¬
allel (or private) welfare state” for its members through collective bargain¬
ing. As a result, autoworkers, having met their own needs, became less and
less interested in joining others to fight for universal programs. A disap¬
###### pointed Reuther remarked, in 1968, that “I have been much saddened by the fact that the American labour movement has not played the decisive
role which it must of necessity play.”

For the American UAW, the postwar period was the golden era. Led by
###### the charismatic Reuther, the UAW established its reputation as a progres¬
sive force in a conservative period and made enviable gains to bring to
###### their members a middle class level of consumption and benefits. But that
effectiveness outside the workplace stood in contrast to, and sometimes
came at the direct expense of, the union’s ability to deal with life in the
workplace. Furthermore, the collective bargaining gains were not matched
by the development of an independent politics; negotiated gains and the
###### union itself remained vulnerable to future changes in the economy and in
society.

###### That vulnerability raised uncomfortable questions about the union’s
future. Would this union, so dependent on its leader’s powerful presence, be
###### the same after Walter Reuther moved on? Would this union, which
emerged in the toughest of economic times and was structured to make
gains in good economic times, be able to mobilize workers when the bad
###### economic times returned (as they would in the seventies and eighties)? With the opposition crushed, with locals increasingly dependent on UAW headquarters, with the bureaucracy growing, and with the spirit that gave birth to the union fading, the “best of times” seemed to bear the seeds of the “worst of times.”

###### Canada: The Same but Different

 Developments in the United States inevitably had an impact on Canada; the Canadians worked for the same employers, confronted an increasingly integrated continental economy, faced similar pressures, had many of the
same needs and, of course, remained tied to the American UAW.

###### The American headquarters influenced both the bargaining direction and politics of the Canadians. Sometimes, as in the case of the Flint sit-
down, this influence was indirect and came by way of positive examples of
###### what workers could achieve. Other times, it was more direct and based on the resources and supportive pressures the UAW could bring to fighting the


-----

companies. But on a significant number of occasions, this influence took the
form of Detroit, with support from sections of the union in Canada, impos¬
ing its perspective on the recalcitrant Canadians.

###### Concentrating on the similarities of the unions on both sides of the border
at that time would, however, overlook crucial differences. Emphasizing these
differences isn’t simply a matter of clarifying the record. They are, rather, the
key to comprehending central developments in the history of the union,
###### including the Canadian union’s eventual split from the American union. Unions are more than the sum of their daily achievements. At least as impor¬ tant, if not more so, is the transition from one point to another. It’s that

process that shapes the culture and soul of a union — its decision-making pro¬
cedures and principles, its leadership’s views of the membership and of the
###### union itself, and its potential to survive future struggles and achieve success.
 After the war the Canadian section of the union was confident and
aggressive. The 1945 Ford strike for union security had sparked similar suc¬
cesses in other sectors, and in 1946, Canadian workers, like workers in the
###### U.S., engaged in a militant push for postwar wage increases. Within the Canadian UAW, Chrysler workers led the way in a 126-day strike while the
rest of the union, especially outside the auto majors, made sure that no other
###### agreements were signed that might undercut the Chrysler workers’ efforts. The main victory in that strike, apart from wages, was the winning of three
paid holidays.

essentially restricted to southern Ontario, simplified the logistics of commu¬

leading the international fight against communism; consequently, it was less
aggressive-repressive than the American state in its attack. (Canada was of
course still linked to and part of that American crusade; the preference of
###### the Canadian state was, however, that labour be left to do the dirty work
itself.) Together, these factors provided the Canadian locals with a shield
###### their American counterparts, picked off one by one, did not have.

 Although we now look back with nostalgia to the fifties, these years were not blissful, even for the organized sections of the working class; two-thirds of workers then, as now, had no union. The mid-fifties saw a significant downturn in the economy which, combined with the growth of automation, hit auto particularly hard.

Between 1953 and 1960, the Canadian market for vehicles increased by
###### fifteen per cent but output fell by fifteen per cent and employment fell even
faster. The apparent contradiction lay in the changing relationship with
###### European industry. The revival of Europe’s productive capacity reduced Canadian overseas auto exports one-quarter while imports into Canada quadrupled. In the U.S., the overseas import share rose to about ten per cent; in Canada it rose to well over twenty-five per cent. When Local 707 in Oakville joined the Ford strike in 1955, more than two-thirds of the
workers were already on lay-off.

###### The 1958 recession was very severe, aggravated by the reversal in auto
trade: Canadian auto exports were falling while imports were rising dramati¬

cally. Plant closures, and especially plant relocations, were increasingly com¬
mon. (Bob White, then a local president in his mid-twenties, was put on the
organizing staff on a temporary basis to deal with these plants.) Then, at the
###### end of the fifties, came Black Monday. The Canadian government cancelled production of the AVRO Arrow in response to American insistence that Canadian defences use the U.S.’s Bomarc missiles. Virtually overnight,
14,000 aerospace employees were left with no place in Canada to apply their

skills.

###### The Canadian economy and society were continuing to move towards greater integration with the United States and greater reliance on resource
exports. Massive public projects, such as the Trans-Canada highway, the St.
Lawrence Seaway, and pipelines, were introduced to facilitate that integra¬
###### tion and reliance Similar public intervention to build the social infrastruc-

several factors: distinct domestic
###### economic conditions, a different
role in the world and therefore a
###### different kind of nationalism as compared to that of the U.S., a state that postponed effective bargaining rights until the end of the war, the creation of lasting democratic structures such as the Canadian Council, and the sur¬
vival of a left opposition. This combination of factors affected the union’s
spirit in Canada; Canadians were putting up resistance, fighting back, refus¬
ing to wait patiently for change, rejecting partnerships with the corpora¬
tions, and debating issues and directions even at the risk of internal divi¬
sion. The Canadian UAW was challenging the stereotypes of Canadians as
###### polite and passive. The union culture reflected Canadian culture, but in a quite distinct way, linked as it was to the experiences of the working class and this particular union.


-----

###### The UAW and the CCF

 The political battles between the left in Canada and the Reuther forces
were tied to the conflicts over the CCF. The CCF believed that it could not
###### have a base in the Canadian UAW until the communists were ousted; therefore, it was very sympathetic to, and worked closely with, the
Reutherites, who were on the same track. In 1947, when Reuther won his
second term, George Burt was part of the left, and the Reuther supporters in
###### Canada ran against him. David Lewis, national secretary of the CCF, indi¬
cated the extent of the Reuther-CCF ties in a letter to Walter Reuther on

10 December 1947 saying: “I am only sorry that our people were unable to
deliver a victory in the Canadian region. My impression is that it is only a
###### matter of time now.”
 Although the CCF was founded in the early thirties and exploded onto the electoral map in Ontario in 1943, the Canadian UAW did not officially
endorse the CCF until December, 1948. The barrier did in fact relate to the

###### CCF-CP conflict over influence within the union. The communists

###### the thirties, was able to rally other activists — including many who weren’t particularly supportive of the CCF and some who argued for a
labour party — against support for any one party.

###### These circumstances led to a spectacle in the 1945 Ontario election: the
UAW endorsed three candidates in Windsor, who were in turn endorsed by
###### the LPP and the Liberals, while the CCF ran competing candidates. The
UAW slate included George Burt, the president of the union; Alex Parent,

###### The left’s strength in the union waned, and Burt himself shifted
away from the CP after Reuther’s
###### ascendancy was clear and the cold war intensified. The union thus moved
steadily towards the CCR By the early fifties, the UAW, along with other
###### key unions such as the United Steelworkers of America and the Packinghouse Workers (now part of the United Food and Commercial
Workers), became the organizational backbone of the party. But that sup-
###### port remained at the level of leadership and staff and was not reflected by the general membership. With the Liberals making some concessions on
progressive programs and, more important, the union making crucial social
gains in collective bargaining, the need for a third party became less urgent.

###### Aircraft workers comprised the only UAW local affiliated to the CCF.

tion, met with mayors of auto communities to garner support for tariff and
###### taxation policy, and established solid community links through union-led
services such as co-op housing and community health clinics.

Second, even as ties with the CCF/NDP grew, a healthy level of skepti¬
cism prevented the relationship from being reduced to one of unconditional

loyalty. The union would, when necessary, challenge the party’s direction.

resources of industry.”

###### y the early sixties, the American section of the union had remained rel¬ B
atively stable for fifteen years, and observers began to note an emerging
###### bureaucratization. In spite of Reuther’s eloquence, the UAW’s education
programs (including the use of radio and TV in a way that American and
###### Canadian unions today would envy), and the development of many superb pamphlets on automation, production standards, health and safety, democ¬

racy, and the failures of capitalism, an ill wind was blowing. Harvey Swados,
a writer who had worked in an auto plant and who was sympathetic to the
###### union, reflected on the UAW in Dissent in October, 1963. He observed the link between ongoing struggles and the potential of the working class:

... struggles themselves function as educational forces for the
###### participants — and the leaders. It is when struggles are post¬ poned or aborted that the fabric of democracy must deterio¬
rate. It is when people are in motion, and are led towards an
###### ethical goal, that they are most receptive to challenges to receive wisdom; more than that they themselves become that


-----

###### tiveness and an intellectual audacity of which they them¬ selves could scarcely conceive in less adventurous times.

 Walter Reuther, looking back at the UAW two years before his death, was also sensitive to the dangers of the American labour movement’s drift into complacency. At a 1968 UAW convention, he noted: “A labour movement can get soft and flabby spiritually. It can make progress materially and the soul of the union can die in the process.”
 The Canadians shared in the gains made by the Americans and fought struggles of their own. They couldn’t escape the pressures the Americans faced — when necessary, the Americans made sure of that. Yet, different cir¬ cumstances and past experiences influenced the Canadians as they shaped their own union culture. The Canadian section of the union had emerged from that same fifteen-year period differently, if only because it endured greater turmoil and the stable UAW pattern did not settle in until the late fifties. There was therefore less time, before the greater disruptions of the sixties, for the establishment of any bureaucratization.
 Even by the end of the sixties, after Burt had moved ideologically towards Reuther, and the remaining opposition to Reutherism in Canada had suffered both electoral defeats (for example, it lost control of the Oshawa local) and collective bargaining defeats (it was forced to accept the American pattern), an oppositional base remained within the union and key locals. That opposition got a new lease on life with an upsurge of Canadian nationalism that was based on the reaction to the growing American domi¬ nance over the economy and on the in-plant rebellions of the sixties.
 The fifties were a mixed blessing. Unions and workers were invited “in” but at a price: they had to develop the proper table etiquette and leave their “bad” manners outside. The issue to come in the sixties, in both Canada and the United States, was whether unions were still a leading force in the movement to challenge the status quo.

###### The sixties have come to mean a time of generational revolt. Throughout the developed capitalist countries, young people who had never experienced the depression, who were born after the war and, uninspired by the fifties,
refused to play the game by the old rules and challenged established authori-

ty. The public’s memory of those times centred on student unrest, but those
who entered the workforce were part of this same rebellion, and even when
###### they were hostile to some aspects of it, they were still influenced by it. As
workers, they expressed their dissatisfaction with the status quo not by drop¬
ping out or participating in political protest; rebellion found expression in
###### their attitudes to the workplace.

Yet even in the workplace, the issues were penetrated by the politics of
###### an emerging English Canadian and a rising Quebec nationalism. In the United States, the antiwar movement fought against an aggressive American nationalism; in Canada, progressives saw nationalism as a positive
force based on our role in the world, our specific relationship to the United
States, and our history as a federation of two nations.

###### Gold-Plated Sweatshops

 Gary Bryner, the young president of the Lordstown, Ohio, local which
became a symbol for the “Blue Collar Blues,” captured some of the changes
in the attitudes of young workers in a 1972 interview:

... someone said Lordstown is the Woodstock of the working
###### man ... long hair, big Afros, beads ... Fathers used to show their manliness by being able to work hard and have big
strong muscles ... the young guy now doesn’t get a kick out
###### of saying how hard he can work ... Father felt patriotic about it ... obligated to that guy that gave him a job to do
his dirty work ... the young guy believes he has something to

say about what he does ... Hell, he may be ten times more
###### intelligent than his foreman ...
 What 1 have to say about what I do, how I do it [is] more important than the almighty dollar. The reason might be that the dollar’s here now ... I can concentrate on the social
aspects, my rights... That’s how 1 got involved in this whole


-----

###### The targets of the workplace revolt and anger often included the union
itself, which had focused so exclusively in the fifties on wages and benefits
###### and neglected working conditions. The report of the 1968 Royal Commission on Labour Relations (the Wood’s Task force) commented: “The fact that worker dissatisfaction sometimes runs as deeply against the union and collective bargaining as against management is reflected in the rebellion of union members against their leaders.”
 With the economy on a roll and this growth providing workers with some
power, this “other sixties” exploded in a wave of rebellion of young workers.
###### In 1963, one-third of UAW local officials in the United States were unelect-
ed. An internal UAW poll of the American membership showed general sat¬
isfaction with the national leadership who successfully negotiated the eco¬
###### nomic package, but two-thirds of workers were disenchanted with the local
leadership whom they held responsible for working conditions. In Canada,
###### contract rejections became common, and the number of strikes grew rapidly. Companies lost more time to strikes in 1966 than in any year since 1946. A
record number of these strikes were wildcats: during the sixties, roughly one-

place conditions. The basic position remained: “Let them produce the gold-
en goose and we’ll share in carving it up.” In the U.S., the potential of a
revival of the union initiated by these young workers was soon lost. The
deep recession and the energy crisis in the mid-seventies consolidated that
loss and brought discipline back to the workplace. The revolt was essentially

over.

###### Not so in Canada. Although the Canadian social protest movements
were relatively weaker, the labour movement was stronger. The defiance of
workers lasted longer, and the political influence of Canadian labour was
###### actually more powerful in the seventies than in the sixties. In fact, the unions themselves became an important vehicle for placing social issues on the national agenda.
 The economic climate in Canada and the deepening of unionization helped to sustain the movement. The Canadian economy benefited from both the growth in the United States and the devalued Canadian dollar, which lowered the costs of exports relative to imports. In the sixties,
Canada’s workforce grew faster than the workforce in any other major devel¬
oped country, and unionization kept pace. Workers in manufacturing may
have been rebelling against their union leaders, but it was equally clear that
###### the workers wanted to sustain their unions. The Canadian UAW regularly
led all other UAW regions in organizing during this period, and it also
###### entered the new telecommunications sector by organizing Northern
Telecom in 1967.

Led by the highly politicized public sector workers in Quebec, unioniza¬
###### tion in the Canadian public sector erupted in 1965 when most of these work¬

ers gained the right to strike. Postal workers and railworkers took on the fight
over the right to negotiate the introduction, and not just the fruits, of tech¬
nological change in the workplace. Such battles in the private and public
sectors reinforced the confidence of the entire Canadian labour movement.

###### Unlike the United States, Canada wasn’t polarized — or paralyzed —
around a dominating international issue. As a result, the door was open for
significant social reforms. Those gains increased workers’ security and there¬
fore the strength of the Canadian labour movement. In the mid-sixties, the
###### minority Liberal government, supported by the NDP, responded to the
mood and pressures of the times by introducing the Canada Pension Plan
and national medicare.

The Canada-U.S. Automotive Products Agreement (Autopact) was a
trade agreement between Canada and the United States introduced in
1965. It more fully integrated the auto industries of Canada and the
United States, providing the Canadian operations a chance to benefit
from larger and more specialized production runs. But it also recognized
the need for safeguards to protect the Canadian industry because of its
dependence on the U.S. in terms of both ownership and size. This was
done by enforcing commitments on multinational corporations. Those
commitments said that if the auto companies wanted to sell in the
Canadian market, they also had to reach certain levels of production in
Canada.

Under this managed trade, companies that produced 50 per cent or
more of their vehicles in North America (Canada and the United States)
could freely ship vehicles and components north or south across the
Canada-U.S. border. On the Canadian side there were additional
conditions that had to be met to get duty-free status: companies had to
assemble roughly one vehicle for every vehicle sold in Canada, and for
each dollar of sales in Canada, companies had to offset this with 60 cents
of value-added production in Canada. (This last condition was
accomplished through direct agreements between the Canadian
government and the auto companies rather than legislatively.)

In the American auto plants, many of the wildcats were led by workers
who, while young, had been in the plants for a decade or more and simply
refused to accept the never-ending speed-ups (almost two-thirds of the
###### American workforce was over 30). In Canada, where the Autopact had led
to a rapid expansion of the workforce, the popular stereotype of new workers
leading the walk-outs — with the tolerance and often the support of the old
guard — was more accurate.

###### The restructuring brought on by the Autopact caused job losses in cer¬ tain plants. But because the pact was introduced during a period of rapid
growth, it resulted in the construction of ninety new plants and twice as
many major expansions. Prominent examples include Chrysler car assembly
###### in Windsor; GM truck assembly in Oshawa; Ford car assembly in St.
Thomas; GM car assembly in Ste-Therese, International Harvester heavy-
duty trucks in Chatham; car and truck frames at Budd in Kitchener and
###### Hayes-Dana in St. Catharines; and car trim at GM in Windsor. In these locations, thousands of young workers were hired. The UAW’s American

###### Although the pay in the auto plants was relatively good, the nature of the work was a shock to the young people flooding in. At the same time, the reality of the power small groups can exercise in assembly plants was well known, and jobs in the auto communities were plentiful. With the disci¬ pline of the market temporarily in abeyance and revolt in the air, the work¬

ers’ readiness to take action against inhumane conditions, arbitrary manage¬
###### ment, and compulsory overtime was hardly surprising.
 When, for example, Chrysler tried to establish compulsory overtime as the norm, members of Local 144 wildcatted for overtime to be voluntary after eight hours each day and forty-eight hours weekly. At de Havilland Aircraft, Local 112 had a wildcat to limit overtime when other workers were
laid off. In St. Thomas, wives and girlfriends picketed the Ford operations
###### on Saturdays to challenge the weekend loss of their partners. One particular
Saturday, the St. Thomas workers threatened job action if management didn’t
###### let them off early so they could cheer for fellow workers in a local hockey tournament. The workers got to the tournament.
 The resistance to overtime was, however, increasingly ambivalent. In
fact, while workers disliked being forced to put in overtime, their growing
###### dependence on it was becoming a matter of concern. In February, 1965, George Burt observed: “Workers have established brand new standards of living based on overtime and I’m afraid persistent overtime is going to endanger their health.”
 This period was crucial to the history of the Canadian UAW in that

this time. They surfaced at a time of shop-floor militancy and social protest,
and this atmosphere shaped, even if it did not determine, their future atti¬
tudes. In contrast, the first generation of American UAW leaders enjoyed a
longer reign and passed the torch to the generation from the fifties, skipping
###### potential leaders who emerged in the sixties.
 Within the union, women had fought alongside men for common work¬
place improvements like limiting speed-up and improved washroom facili¬
ties. Yet female members still faced the bias of separate seniority lists. The
###### economic restructuring that followed the Autopact both aggravated and highlighted this inequity. Women with high seniority lost their jobs as departments were closed or cut back, while lower-seniority male workers
remained. When expansions later occurred in departments that traditionally
excluded women, companies often hired new workers, ignoring the women
who had been laid off.

###### At that time, the Human Rights Code of Ontario prohibited discrimina¬ tion on a number of grounds, but these did not include the sex and marital
status of the worker. In 1970, the legislation was finally amended after a
long and intensive lobbying campaign and the introduction of a private
member’s bill by member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) Cliff Pilkey, the
former president of GM Oshawa Local 222.

UAW women in Oshawa played a decisive role. No doubt, the emer¬
gence of a broader women’s movement helped give them the support and
###### confidence they needed to win seniority rights. That this amendment took

so long to achieve was not simply a matter of corporate resistance, though
###### corporations were the source of this discriminatory practice. It is also a reminder of the difficulty of changing broader social assumptions, especially
those steeped in tradition. The powerful lesson was that sometimes change
in the workplace occurs only as part of broader social change.

###### But Don’t Forget Wages ...

Labour militancy in the sixties was generally based on both workplace and
pay issues. Inflation was accelerating, the newly organized public sector was
###### making up for lost time, railworkers and workers on the St. Lawrence
Seaway were setting high standards, and Canadian autoworkers’ discussions
###### at the Big Three were finally turning to wage parity with the Americans.
 The principle of wage parity with American autoworkers — the same
pay for the same work — had been a demand by Canadian workers from day
###### one. But the smaller Canadian market, with its less efficient production
runs, remained a barrier to winning that equality. The Autopact integrated
###### Canada into the same market and productive system as the U.S. (with some Canadian safeguards) and gave Canadians a clear rationale for demanding
equal wages: they were now as productive as Americans. The pact also gave
###### the UAW in the U.S. a good reason to insist on parity: it did not want to compete with an equally productive neighbour that paid lower wages.
 After three decades of unionization, the implementation of wage parity with American Big Three workers was relatively straightforward. The policy
was phased in during the 1968 agreement. Parity committees studied jobs on
###### each side of the border, and workers performing the same tasks received the
same basic wage in their own currency. Wages differed according to the
###### inflation rates in each country, but this discrepancy was erased in 1973 by the introduction of a Canada-U.S. COLA formula which provided workers
in both countries with identical cost-of-living increases.

###### Canada-U.S. wage parity in the Big Three, and especially the large wage
increases that went along with it for the Canadians, immediately led to a
series of wage-related comparisons and confrontations across the indepen¬
###### dent parts, aerospace, and agricultural implements sectors. Workers still confronted the occasional employer when the issue was a wage freeze or concessions (e.g., the 134'day strike at Dominion Forge, an auto compo¬ nents plant in Windsor), but the dominant issue in the union, especially in the auto parts sector, was matching the increases at the Big Three. The overwhelming majority of legal strikes in the late sixties occurred amongst these independent suppliers to the auto majors.
 In aerospace, the issue was less direct. Of particular significance was the two-month strike at McDonnell-Douglas in 1971. The U.S. had introduced
wage controls, and the American negotiators seemed to have reached a set¬
###### tlement within those guidelines The Canadian bargaining team rejected


-----

###### the offer. When the continuing strike threatened to disrupt American
plants, the union’s international office — with the support of the Canadian
director — eventually ordered the local to vote on the offer. The argument
was that the Canadians had essentially achieved their objective of matching
###### the Big Three pattern increase, and therefore no longer had a reason to con¬ tinue the strike.
 While there were grounds for debating whether the pattern was com¬
pletely met, events and the locals’ own wage demands had moved the con¬
###### frontation beyond the technicality of how the pattern should be applied to
McDonnell-Douglas in Canada. At the subsequent membership meeting, a
group within the union stormed the stage and prevented a vote, arguing that
###### the meeting should have only been informational. After bitter recrimina¬
tions between the local and the national office, the members voted to return
to work in defiance of the local leadership. But the local leadership in turn
received a strong endorsement in the subsequent elections in defiance of the
###### national and international offices. Hostility between the local and national union, not to mention the international union, didn’t abate for almost two
decades.

###### The significance of these events is not restricted to the internal conflict
in the union; it extends to the many issues this conflict straddled and in
some ways foreshadowed. This instance was the most visible of a number of
postparity conflicts. Since the formation of the union, Canadians had tried
###### to catch up to Americans in each sector. Now they were rejecting parity with their American aerospace counterparts and looking to Canadian com¬
parisons such as the gains made in Canadian auto plants. This change in
###### attitude was part of a more general trend in which Canadian workers were
no longer viewing the U.S. as their role model. That trend was later a key
###### factor in the mobilization of massive opposition to the Canada-U.S. Free
Trade Agreement (FTA).

Furthermore, the readiness with which the Americans accepted voluntary
wage guidelines was one indicator of the UAW’s future readiness to accept
concessions. Similar discussions between the Canadian government and the
unions had been unproductive, and the Canadian labour movement fought
###### controls even when they were mandated by law in 1975. In a sense, the
McDonnell-Douglas fight was therefore also an early skirmish against such
limits on bargaining. In terms of strategy, that strike was one of the few
instances where a Canadian shut-down had a major impact on American
facilities It therefore precursor of later developments that revealed the

###### production, which leave compa¬
nies vulnerable to disruptions anywhere in the production chain.

Most important, however, the McDonnell-Douglas conflict was an indi¬
###### cator of a new surge of nationalism in the country which linked economic demands to political perspectives. The immediate tension may have been over the American leadership’s response to wage demands, and the changing demands of the local’s bargaining team may have been questionable. But the emotional side of this strike could not be understood without consideration of the intensifying debates over American domination of the Canadian economy. The arrogance of this American multinational company, the
weakness of the American UAW’s response to wage controls, and the appar¬
###### ent order from Detroit to end the strike fed into and reinforced a growing
left nationalism in Canada.

The union involved was the Canadian Textile and Chemical Union (CTCU).
The main speakers at the rally included Andreas Papandreaou, then active in the
Greek community and later Prime Minister of Greece, Jim Hunter of the
Canadian Brotherhood of Rail and Transport Workers (CBRT), and Abe Taylor
of Local 222 Oshawa. The CTCU, UE, and CBRT are now part of the CAW.
One of the workers from McDonnell-Douglas who came to the protest was
arrested. He and six other sympathetic Douglas activists showed up for work late
and they were suspended. This led to a sickdn by the union membership; five of
the key leaders of the local at Douglas were subsequently fired.

###### Which Side Are You On?

 The Canadian UAW, like the American UAW, did not easily cope with the social movements outside the union. In Canada, despite the conflicts accompanying those movements, the union itself eventually integrated much of the spirit of rebellion and moral challenge to the status quo


-----

###### which the movements represented. In the United States, the divisions
grew deeper.

###### The two most intense and divisive movements of the decade were based in the United States: the civil rights movement, which began the slow march to citizenship for the black population, and the mobilization against the war in Vietnam, which led hundreds of thousands of young people to question what America stood for. It was in the civil rights marches and non- violent sit-in campaigns of the American South that young white students
from the northern states got their first taste of activism. They returned to
apply their new-found organizing skills at the community level and then in
###### the antiwar demonstrations on campuses.
 The songs of protest sung in the early sixties were often based on the labour songs of the thirties. This influence reflected labour’s history as the
most important and lasting movement of that earlier period, but also high¬
lighted the extent to which labour’s link to other movements was now only
by way of its past. American labour couldn’t comprehend the urban rebel¬
lions and black rage. It was generally absent from the civil rights protests
###### and the antiwar demonstrations.
 There were some exceptions, the most notable being the UAW and Walter Reuther. Reuther had joined the civil rights marches in the South, and in turn, Martin Luther King spoke at UAW functions. But this alliance never became permanent nor did it lead to sustained organizing break¬ throughs in the South. As the black movement mobilized and became radi¬
calized, the UAW faced several choices. The choices the union leadership
###### ultimately made, within both the Democratic Party and the UAW itself, blocked closer ties to the civil rights movement.
 In 1964, the delegation from Mississippi to the Democratic Convention included blacks. When the nonracial Mississippi Freedom Party held its own
statewide democratic convention to choose delegates for that same conven¬
###### tion and insisted that it be seated in spite of the presence of the official all- white delegation from Mississippi, Reuther — concerned about internal party turmoil — supported the party establishment.

Later, when angry young blacks, influenced by the growing militancy in
###### their community, fought management over workplace conditions in the Detroit factories and simultaneously challenged the union on the lack of black representation on staff and the executive board, they were branded
“extremists.” Frustrated young black workers watched Reuther marching on


-----

Detroit?” They noted the eventual moves to bring blacks in as union offi¬
cials and acknowledged that the UAW had gone further than other unions.
However, they complained bitterly that those black leaders chosen were not
based amongst the militants but were politically safe.

###### The ties to the student antiwar movement followed a similar path. In the
first days of that movement, when the students were developing a broad
challenge to the overall direction of American society, the UAW was direct¬

ly supportive. The American student left even drafted its manifesto, the
Port Huron Statement, at the UAW summer camp. The UAW financed the
first organizer of the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), and con¬
###### tributed to their community campaigns and other projects. The bridge between the movements was often labour families crossing the generational
divide. Labour activists from the thirties were now in influential union posi¬
tions and their sons and daughters who were now in “the movement” sought
and received financial support.

vive the antiwar protests. Emil

###### The Canadian left had the advantage of being energized by the American movements without having to confront, to anywhere near the
same degree, the bitterly divisive issues of race and war. Canadian politics
wasn’t about the forceful capture of black slaves, the denial of the most fun¬
###### damental citizenship rights to a large internal minority, the bombing of
civilians in a country thousands of miles away, or the maimed war veterans
who came home to tell the stories of those who didn’t. While the American
left fought against its country’s aggressive nationalism, the defining issue for
###### the left in both English and French Canada was the assertion of a defensive and emerging nationalism.
 This nationalism differed from American flag-waving because Canada
wasn’t a superpower intent on making the world safe for American capital¬
ism. In fact, Canada’s sovereignty was based on finding a way to escape the
###### domination of that superpower and to prevent it from stifling Canadian potential. In the case of Quebec nationalism, the focus was on liberation: Quebecers were simultaneously recovering something lost while shedding a conservative past that held back the province’s creativity and promise.

Because the main vehicle for the increasing penetration of the U.S. into
###### Canada was economic — foreign investment and trade — Canadian nation¬ alism was debated in economic terms. This emphasis put the Canadian UAW at the centre of political debates within the left. Could Canada chal¬
lenge economic integration with the U.S. and follow nationalist industrial
strategies such as developing a Canadian car? Could international unions
play a role in a nationalist movement? Would the international unions limit
###### nationalism in the NDP?
 In each case, the Canadian UAW leadership found itself at odds with the nationalist left, which included sections of its own membership. The union supported the Autopact, arguing that the industry was already so integrated with, and dependent on, the American companies that a Canadian car was simply not on the agenda. Canadian safeguards for a fair
share of the industry, along with income protection for those affected by
###### the restructuring, were therefore the main goal. The union defended its ties to the American-based UAW, arguing that the measure of a union was its internal democracy and direct achievements, not its nationality. In addi¬ tion, the top leadership emphasized that internationalism as applied to


-----

###### A Canadian Car?

The CAW council supported the principle of the Autopact, though it
rejected the actual agreement because of its inadequate support for those
affected by the possible restructuring. In addition to the official Canadian
UAW brief, three other briefs — each taking a left nationalist perspective
— were presented: Local 444 (Chrysler); the GM inter-corporate council
(though they had divisions); and the Windsor Council of the Unemployed
(linked primarily to Local 444 and Local 200). These alternatives to
further integration with the American industry pointed towards building a
Canadian car.

While Canadian nationalism had significant support in even some
conservative circles, this support would go up in smoke once the radical
implications of a Canadian car were spelled out. The legacy of dependency
had left the Canadian industry without the industrial structure and skills
to compete head on with the Americans. To keep prices reasonable we
would have to limit imports in order to get economies of scale. But this
meant limiting consumer choices in the face of options which readily
existed across the border; risking retaliation which might impact on other
sectors such as steel; and shutting some Canadian plants as we moved
away from a wide range of models. While jobs would be expanded with the
higher Canadian content in a Canadian car, many of these jobs would be
in other communities, for other workers. Moving to a Canadian car would
therefore have meant addressing all kinds of complex issues for which, in
spite of the enthusiasm, there was no economic and political base.

The argument that the pact would further integrate this crucial industry
with the United States, further limiting Canadian sovereignty, was correct
(though the industry was already virtually completely American'
dominated). Nor did the pact provide the Canadian industry with the
crucial aspects of any independent industry — research, design,
development, process engineering, and high-technology parts production.
The opposition to the pact was, however, wrong in warning that there
would be a net shift of jobs away from Canada. The restructuring that
followed the Autopact did mean closures and “rationalizations” that
spelled job loss for many, but the overall impact did increase jobs.

Employment in the Canadian auto industry went from 32,000 in 1964
to 60,000 in 1973. With access to the American market, a lower dollar,
and the safeguards to maintain assembly plants, Canada got new
investments to make the existing plants world scale. This gave us the


-----

advantage of having the more modern plants in Canada and it created the
opportunity for parts plants to produce larger runs for these larger plants
producing standardized product. Having this higher efficiency, it increased
the opportunities for parts plants and assembly plants to export to the
###### United States. (American tariff reductions were a less significant factor.)

Although the debate over the Autopact continued for years, that debate
gradually merged into a consensus that essentially accepted the logic of the
Autopact. When the Americans tried to erode the pact, there was
unanimity within the Canadian UAW in defending the importance of the
safeguards; even those originally opposed recognized that Canada was now
more vulnerable to their withdrawal. And when the Americans shifted
their focus elsewhere, the continued imbalance in favour of assembly lead
to unanimity within the union to strengthen the safeguards to get more
parts production and some research and development.

###### NDP had already defined itself as primarily an electoral party, whose main
goal was to come to political office. The Waffle’s idea of a socialist party
placed immediate electoral success second.

###### The Waffle group included different tendencies, but to its key activists, the main point of a party was to educate, organize, mobilize, build under¬ standing, and expand the number of activists. The Waffle’s goal was to
lead and coordinate campaigns and struggles, and eventually unify work¬
ers, unions, and other progressive groups into an unstoppable political
force. To lifetime NDP stalwarts such as Dennis McDermott, who had
###### taken over the helm of the Canadian UAW in 1968, the Waffle’s increas¬
ingly radical ideas and actions threatened the NDP’s electoral chances. In
1971, McDermott told the Canadian Council:

Labour desires a change in the social order now and not
###### 50-100 years from now ... It is my belief that the end pur¬
pose of political and ideological belief is to bring that belief
to fulfilment and in one’s own lifetime. Fulfilment means
power, power means government, and government means
changing the social order now ...

###### This assessment had some short-term validity, and after the Waffle was
expelled, the NDP was in fact successful in a number of provincial elections.
But as the future history of the NDP showed, the loss of committed young
people with ideas and vision cost the party dearly. Ironically, many of these
people later returned to work with the labour movement — in some ways
more productively. Having been excluded from the NDP, they and other
young people disenchanted with the NDP drifted into other forms of poli¬
tics. Some ended up in coalitions which became part of the impressive
alliance with labour that almost defeated the FTA. A good number became
###### union activists through their jobs and have since risen to important posi¬
tions within the labour movement. Others found work directly in the union
###### movement as staff, and many joined the feminist movement. Within the
trade union movement, groups such as Organized Working Women (OWW)
###### lobbied for changes in structures and policies. These socialist feminists,
refusing to write off the trade union movement even in difficult times,
established — to a degree unique to any country — strong links with the
labour movement.


-----

###### movements did not become the dead weight of a renewed and false stability. Although the nationalist left was defeated in Canada, the labour movement and others eventually adopted much of its perspective. As a result, militancy and politicization continued and even expanded within the labour move- ment. The evolution of the Canadian UAW’s positions from the sixties to the mid-eighties and beyond is one of the best examples of change within the movement. By the mid-eighties, the union that, a dozen years earlier, had been the leading defender of its international connections had bolted
from its own international union; it ended up playing — by way of the anti-
FTA fight — a leading role in the battle against further integration into the
###### U.S. and it increasingly attacked the NDP from the left.
 That evolution reflected more general trends in the Canadian labour movement, the Canadian UAW’s own political make-up and culture, and the particular response of the union’s new leader to the criti¬
cisms and challenges facing the Dennis McDermott relates the

 Within months of taking office in 1968, McDermott announced his opposition to the U.S. role in Vietnam, even though Walter Reuther and the UAW executive board remained mute on the subject. Soon after, con¬ fronting an employer (North American Plastics) that was determined to
break the union, McDermott took an unusual but dramatic last-resort step:

strikes. In many of the large units, the companies did not challenge the

pickets were an important educational tool of the union. To compensate for

###### McDermott moved the Canadian office from Windsor to Toronto, offi¬
cially to be closer to the national media but unofficially to create some phys¬
ical distance from Detroit. Remarkably, the UAW, one of the most powerful
###### unions in Canada, did not have its own research department or its own
newspaper. Instead, the American UAW paper had a Canadian supplement.
###### McDermott successfully set up a research department and a national paper and raised the status of Canadians at the meetings of the International
Metalworkers Federation from merely being part of an American UAW del¬
egation to representing workers in a sovereign country. McDermott’s nation¬
alism also included a sympathetic appreciation of the nationalism of others,
in particular Quebecers.

###### Quebec: The Not So Quiet Revolution

 No part of Canada experienced more change during the sixties than Quebec. With the death of the reactionary and iron-fisted Premier of
Quebec, Maurice Duplessis, Quebec emerged from the Grande Norcier (Dark
Ages) and entered a decade of capitalist reform and modernization that wit¬
nessed the explosion of both militant trade unionism and nationalist senti¬
ments.

###### During the sixties, the number of organized workers in the province
almost doubled, and Quebec’s rate of unionization became one of the high¬
est in North America. The Quebec Federation of Labour (QFL) moved from
being a modest provincial body to a labour body at the centre of decisions
###### on bargaining and the political direction of its affiliates. The Catholic-based central union dropped its religious ties, establishing the primarily public sec¬
tor-based CNTU (Confederation of National Trade Unions). The existence
of the CNTU pushed the QFL in a more nationalist direction. Though its
###### competition with the QFL would later become bitter, the two centrals
brought a new dynamism to the Canadian labour movement. The two cen¬
trals joined in fighting the War Measures Act and, in 1972, organized —
along with the teachers’ central — a virtual general strike in Quebec. In the
process of this mobilization, the educational material prepared by these cen¬
trals added radical socialist ideas to the nationalist analysis.

 in Ontario, and the lack of Council, 19 December, 1943 additional resources com¬ ing from Detroit. In 1947, the union again considered the potential for growth within Quebec, focus¬ ing unsuccessfully on approximately 17,000 garage workers. (These workers eventually joined the CAW by means of the Canadian Brotherhood of Railway Transport and General Workers.) While the UAW did experience growth in Quebec through the fifties, the real breakthroughs came in the mid-sixties, with the establishment of GM’s assembly plant in Ste-Therese and the successful vote at United Aircraft (now Pratt and Whitney).
 The War Measures Act, which took away civil liberties in Quebec, was introduced in 1970 under the pretext of fighting terrorism. It is now gener¬ ally known that the actual goal was to weaken Quebec’s nationalist move¬ ment; the federal government already had the police powers to deal with terrorist activists and the murder of Pierre Laporte, Quebec’s minister of labour. Few individuals or institutions outside Quebec escaped the resulting hysteria, but the UAW’s Canadian Council, with McDermott leading the argument, eventually passed a resolution exposing and condemning the actions of the federal and Quebec governments. Subsequently, in 1977, the UAW also passed a resolution recognizing Quebec’s historic claim as one of the founding nations of Canada.
 Two UAW strikes during the sixties and early seventies, both strongly supported by the national office in Canada, played a prominent political role in Quebec. In 1970, GM workers at Ste-Therese included as a major demand their right to work in their own language. As the Financial Times subsequently reported on May 16, 1977:

###### end with the promise of language legislation, laying the
groundwork for the 1974 Official Language Act.

###### At the beginning of 1974, the workers at United Aircraft in Longueuil
(Local 510) launched a strike that was originally over issues such as upgrad-
ing their lagging wages and benefits but eventually focused on the more fun-
###### damental issue of union recognition. As the strike dragged on, the union
successfully mobilized funds and special monthly contributions from its
locals across Canada. But in August, 1974, eight months into the strike and
while the Canadian director was out of the country, the international secretary'
treasurer did something inexplicable. Without consulting McDermott, Emil
Mazey sent letters to the strikers and all Canadian locals, accusing the local
###### union of fraud in obtaining extra benefits. The accusation was technically
true, but the additional funds were not going into anyone’s pocket. They
were being channelled into emergency relief for the strikers. Mazey’s letter
###### threatened to undermine support.
 On his return to Canada, a furious McDermott, foreseeing the implica¬
tions not only for the strike but also for the Quebec labour movement and
###### the UAW’s role in Quebec, arranged a loan from the QFL to continue strike
payments until the issue was resolved. At the next council meeting, he put
###### forth and received support for an unprecedented resolution condemning
Mazey’s actions. There had been many conflicts with the international
office over the years, but for the first time, a Canadian director had led the
criticism on a major policy issue and demanded a reversal by the interna¬
###### tional union with the support of the Canadian secondary leadership. Since Mazey was embroiled in other conflicts in the union at the time, McDermott wasn’t as isolated within the international executive board as he might have been. Mazey’s policy was reversed and when McDermott introduced Local 510 leadership to the Canadian Council in June 1975,
they were welcomed as heroes.

###### This first significant crisis in the relationship between the Canadian
UAW and its parent organization had, interestingly enough, occurred with¬
in Quebec. In a strange twist of events, sensitivity to Quebec nationalism
###### had led to a crucial expression of Canadian sovereignty and nationalism.
 The long and bitter United Aircraft strike ended in August, 1975, after
almost twenty months. It had included professional strikebreakers, dogs, vio¬
###### lent confrontations, mass demonstrations and cultural events, and then a

###### y the mid-fifties, it seemed that capitalism had attained a new normalcy B in North America. Conflicts between labour and management were contained within fairly narrow limits, steady material progress was assured,
and the only threat was externally based — the Soviet Union.

Suddenly, in the United States, a generation stood up and challenged
###### the morality behind the normalcy. It questioned society’s commitment to the democratic values that were repeatedly expressed but were absent in the
schools, in the workplace, and in America’s foreign policy. It questioned
society’s commitment to equality for blacks and for women. The American
labour movement, however, proved incapable of tapping into this energy
and potential, as did the UAW. The UAW had failed to make strong con¬
###### nections with and channel the angry energy of its own members; it could hardly be expected to form lasting bonds with external movements. The
UAW — for all its achievements — had been drained of its own spirit.

###### That failure condemned American trade unions to a long and steady
slide to marginalization. Walter Reuther’s death in 1970 may have symbol¬

ized the death of an era for American labour, but labour’s fall was by then
well established. For American unions, the sixties offered the last chance for
revival or even transformation. That chance was lost.

In Canada, the countermovement was neither as intense nor as explosive
as in the United States but, especially in the labour and women’s move¬
###### ments, it lasted longer. The Canadian UAW’s relationship with the new
movements was hardly smooth. No formal or informal ties of any significance
emerged. Yet the Canadian union was influenced by surrounding events and
emerged from this turbulent period with greater militancy and a stronger
sense of its role. There was no breakthrough in political power or dramatic
###### achievements in relating to the Canadian movements, but unlike their American counterparts, Canadian unions remained a relevant social force. This modest achievement was crucial given the impending attack on labour.
 The social unionism of Walter Reuther couldn’t take root in the United
States because of both the conservative climate and the way the seeds were
###### planted. The great irony of the UAW was that any hope of Reuther’s ideals taking hold seemed narrowed to the one region of the union that had histor¬
ically retained some significant opposition to Reutherism.

UNION MEMBERS AND LEADERSHIP REACT TO WAGE CONTROLS

A 16 mm. colour—55 minute film

directed by Jim Littleton

On October 14, 1975, the Liberal Government introduced wage controls. The labour
movement saw that this program attacked one of the few instruments working people
have for defending themselves in an unequal society—collective bargaining through
their unions. This tilm covers the period between March 22—the historic demonstration
in Ottawa—and April 10 and 11—the UAW collective bargaining conference. It shows
workers and their leaders discussing the controls at their place of work, at their union
halls, at their conventions and on the way to Ottawa. The film expresses their opposition
to the controls, their determination to fight the government program and their growing
confidence as they struggle collectively to defeat the controls.

— Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau

###### The excitement of the sixties stemmed from a feature common to other
rebellious periods: the people seemed to have grabbed the initiative. But by
###### the mid-seventies, the corporations held the initiative once again. Although the seventies were a period of great labour militancy in Canada, that mili¬
tancy was becoming defensive.

Ironically, this reversal was rooted not in capitalism’s success, but in its
immediate failures. By the early seventies, the evidence was growing that
falling profits, rising unemployment, and accelerating inflation weren’t sim¬
ply cyclical problems; instead, they were signals that the postwar economic
boom was over. With no alternative force to initiate a progressive redirec¬
###### tion of the economy, this potential crisis on the right — the failure of busi¬
ness to provide stable economic security — became a crisis on the left. The
agenda and momentum moved quickly towards an even greater dependence
on strengthening corporations and the business climate.

Since the seventies, the corporations have retained that initiative and
used it to restructure both the economy and expectations. At best, the
###### Canadian labour movement slowed down the corporate agenda and kept
some alternative values and ideas alive — limited yet crucially important
achievements.

###### Lowering Expectations, Redefining Progress

 The sixties had raised expectations by asking fundamental questions about the alleged democratic values of capitalism. By the end of that decade, another issue was emerging in North America: capitalism’s capacity to pro¬
vide a constantly rising material standard of living.

###### The unique conditions central to the postwar success of the United
States, and therefore Canada, had disappeared. Manufacturers faced a profit
squeeze, and the U.S. economy faced growing trade deficits and an outflow
###### of capital. The era of access to cheap raw materials and America’s over¬
whelming economic dominance was coming to an end. Demands for raw
materials grew, while the most ready sources of supply dried up, and some
###### Third World countries had room to insist on better prices. The U.S. was diverting resources to fight the war in Vietnam, while Europe and Japan,

fully recovered from the war, were advancing economically on the United
States. The results were intensified competition and the steady transforma-


-----

###### tion of the relationship between these blocs.
 The energy crisis of 1973—75, when oil prices quadrupled, aggravated this economic crisis. Companies tried to protect their profits in the face of added material costs and increased competition by limiting wage increases. When
workers resisted, the companies raised prices to maintain their profits and
###### protect their stockholders. And when workers then responded to the high rate of inflation with militant wage demands to protect their standard of liv¬
ing, this conflict over the distribution of income led to accelerating infla¬
###### tion. The higher prices, in turn, fed concerns about the loss of international competitiveness.

Every country felt compelled to increase its exports of manufactured
goods, thereby providing jobs and additional national income, while limit¬
ing its imports. This strategy would alleviate the rising unemployment and
pay for the escalating costs of raw materials. The catch was that one coun¬

try’s exports were another’s imports; the unanimous adoption of this strategy
resulted in everyone producing more but buying less.

###### The result was “stagflation” — high unemployment and high prices. Since the fifties, people had taken on faith that modern capitalism would no
longer have to face wild fluctuations in economic activity and prices. By the
mid-seventies, that confidence in capitalism’s ability to provide steady and
###### stable growth was profoundly shaken. Along with this realization came a profound change in the lives of working people. From this point on, reduc¬
ing inflation would be a central goal of Canadian economic policy; the
###### underlying assumption was that, with zero inflation, all other economic
problems would iron themselves out. In the interim, high unemployment
would have to be tolerated. An indicator of the changing times was the fact
###### that the lowest unemployment rate after 1975 was still higher than the rate
in any year between 1941 and 1975.

###### The economic and political elite attempted to persuade and/or force
workers to reduce their demands so that inflation would fall and the econo¬

my’s relative competitiveness would be strengthened. This situation had the
makings of a political crisis. Workers previously considered greater job secu¬
rity, higher wages, and a more equitable distribution of wealth to be the
fruits and even the essence of progress. Now these benefits were being rede¬
fined as problems standing in the way of competitiveness. In the past, trade
###### unions could justify such goals as being good for the economy because they maintained purchasing power; now the unions were attacked for inhibiting


-----

Capitalism’s inability to justify itself either morally or materially creat¬
ed the perfect scenario for a challenge to the system. There was, however,
no social force in Canada or the United States that was interested in, or
###### capable of mounting, such a challenge. As a result, capitalism not only
rode out this storm and its occasional bumps, but also used it to become
stronger.

###### This situation was clearest in the United States, where the hopes of the sixties had been dashed. It wasn’t that worker struggles had faded.
Mineworkers suffered through a long confrontation to win compensation
###### for lung disease, and the UAW fought tough battles at International Harvestor and Caterpillar, manufacturers of farm machinery and other heavy equipment. Also, the UAW made a major breakthrough in 1976 with an innovative program on reduced work-time that revived the possi¬
bility of a transition towards the four-day week. And, in the late seventies,
UAW president Doug Fraser led an attempt to form a new alliance with
promises of returning to the organizing style and militancy of the thirties.

But the American labour movement was constrained by its history and the
self-fulfilling prophecies of its leadership. Its mobilizing and organizing skills
###### had been laid off for too long, and rust had set in. The leaders’ claim that the
members were too demoralized or too complacent to fight was, because of
###### American labour’s recent past, partly true. But it was also true that the leaders
used this argument as an excuse for not attempting remobilization.

Lacking confidence in itself and fearing that militant national campaigns
###### might further isolate it and undermine the electoral chances of the Democratic Party (on whom it depended for better legislation), the American labour movement slid into irrelevancy. Its response to Nixon’s
call for voluntary controls in the early seventies was weak and confused.
###### The labour movement was unable to persuade sympathetic (Democratic) administrations to improve America’s unsympathetic labour legislation;
instead, the movement faced increasingly antagonistic labour board inter¬
###### pretations of existing legislation. American labour possessed neither an alternative strategy for fighting legislation nor a means of using its still
impressive resources to spread unionization to new regions and sectors.

###### In June 1981, when President Reagan legislated air traffic controllers back to work as the American labour movement watched meekly, he exposed
organized labour in the U.S. as a paper tiger. On behalf of employers, he
declared open season on all workers. By the early eighties, the acceptance of


-----

###### movement — confirmed that American labour had virtually given up.
 The distinguishing factor of the Canadian response to “the new reality”
was that, in spite of Canada’s tight economic integration with the United
###### States, the movement showed sustained signs of resistance, and therefore
life. One dimension of that distinction was captured by the electoral moods
###### and trends as the sixties ended.
 In 1968, Nixon, with a strong anti-union and antiprogressive history,
became president of the United States. That same year brought Trudeau to
power in Canada, riding a sixties image and carrying a banner calling for a
Just Society. In 1972, Nixon was reelected in the U.S. In Canada, the NDP,
led by David Lewis, won the balance of power. Although the Waffle group
###### had been expelled, its influence on NDP politics left a residue, and the coun¬
try itself was open to the left-populist slogan of the Lewis campaign: taking
###### on the “corporate welfare bums.” Later, when the Tories called for wage and price controls, Trudeau — desperate for worker votes and with the NDP breathing down his neck — ridiculed the idea. Trudeau won a majority gov¬ ernment in 1974- The provincial election of left-leaning and left-dependent governments led to significant labour law reform in Canada. NDP govern¬ ments were elected in three provinces: in Manitoba in 1969-77; in Saskatchewan in 1971-82; and in British Columbia in 1972-5. The PQ, in
power from 1976 to 1985, also clearly leaned towards social democracy.

###### These events seemed to have the makings of the NDP’s moment in the
sun. During the heady sixties, even the Liberals were proposing social demo¬
###### cratic policies and therefore competing with the NDP. But as the Liberals began to retreat from recent definitions of progress, the field was left to the
NDP. The establishment had always called on workers to restrain their
###### demands but now, for the first time since the war, it clearly stood for the bit¬ ter medicine of lowering people’s expectations and insisting they stifle their
demands. Canadians had not signed on yet and the NDP took advantage of
###### the opportunity.
 The NDP attacked corporations for demanding that others take less
while the corporate elite took more. It revived the issue of American con¬
###### trol of Canada’s resources and economy, resurrecting some themes of the
exiled Waffle group. It argued for price controls on certain necessities, and it
###### challenged the logic of creating more jobs by reducing purchasing power. In
office, or where it was influential, the NDP led in the introduction of health
###### and safety legislation and progressive labour reform.

plunged still deeper at the end of the decade.

malize the right to union security, and assumed control of plants in a desper¬
ate protest of the corporations’ unilateral right to rob communities of the
tools that allowed workers to use their skills.

During the sixties, the strike records of Canada and the U. S. were similar.

workers and their new unions continued their fight to bring their wages up
after the lag in the pre-union period, and workers in the resource sector took
advantage of the boom in their industries. Workers in the manufacturing sec¬

 One-third of the strikes in the seventies were wildcats, which were illegal
in all Canadian provinces except Saskatchewan. This number was proportion¬

conditions, legal. In Canada, wildcats were led at the local level and, while

profit-maximizing rules, had not translated this natural wealth into a stronger
manufacturing base. Furthermore, Canada was linked to a declining power
###### that was increasingly “looking after it own.” As a consequence, pressured by
Canada’s powerful banks with their priority of reducing inflation, and con¬
cerned that the strength of Canadian labour relative to that of the United
States would undermine competitiveness, the nervous Liberals reversed their
###### election promise and introduced compulsory wage controls effective October,

1975.

###### Controlling Wages, Controlling Unions

Wage controls — legal limits on what workers could negotiate — were
###### directed at breaking the momentum of the Canadian labour movement, which kept resisting corporate pressures and refusing to accede to govern¬ ment lectures on economics. The labour movement was united in opposi¬ tion, recognizing that acceptance of controls in any form, especially since
they included no offsetting benefits, risked the union’s alienation from the
membership. The government offered no trade-offs, such as equitable tax
reform or enriched social programs to buy labour’s compliance. But as col¬
lective agreements expired, labour generally had no concrete response other
###### than the rhetoric of opposition.
 The Canadian UAW’s response began with the recognition that wage
controls differed from other attacks on working people such as tax increases,
###### which affected workers as individuals or family units. Wage controls consti¬ tuted an attack on the organization itself. Controls undermined unions by
imposing the most severe limits on their ability to fulfil workers’ expecta¬
tions in negotiating the price and conditions of labour. In contrast, the gov¬
###### ernment made no attempt to control corporate power over price determina¬ tion and the direction of investment. (The focus of the Liberals was not sur¬ prising since they were trying to improve the “investment climate” as
defined by private corporations.) If unions were to retain the confidence of
###### their membership, it was essential that they not only avoid any role in
endorsing controls, but also actively mobilize all aspects of their organiza¬
tions to fight them.

Because controls were not universally popular, the government conceded

###### and appeal procedures). The UAW’s bargaining strategy was to build on, and take advantage of, this flexibility. In each set of negotiations, bargaining
was to occur as if the controls didn’t exist. Any agreement should exclude
###### recognition of the controls apparatus and would have to be fully implement'
ed by the company or a strike would begin or continue. With the contract
in place, the bureaucracy of the program worked in the union’s favour. If the
###### Anti-Inflation Board (AIB) ruled against any settlement, the union called on the appeal procedure and used any delaying tactics it could. The compa¬
nies — nervous about introducing a reduction in pay — were put in a posi¬
###### tion that strongly encouraged them to support the union arguments. In con¬ trast to a process in which workers depended solely on technical arguments and then waited anxiously to see if Ottawa approved the negotiations, this situation allowed workers to continue to receive full pay.
 This strategy was taken to the Canadian Council and the staff. The union set up meetings with activists (local leaders, bargaining committees,
stewards, education committees) on a regional basis. It distributed pam¬
###### phlets and addressed the issues in local union papers and at union educa- tionals. The campaign for Canadian content in auto was linked to the fight
against wage controls and provided workers with an alternative focus and
policy to the controls. If the central issue was jobs, then the answer was
mobilizing to put restrictions, such as the Canadian content requirements,
###### on companies rather than on workers. All bargaining was centrally moni¬ tored to ensure as close adherence as possible to the policy. With this base, the union worked within the Canadian Labour Congress (CLC) towards a broader political protest against the controls, which eventually led to the National Day of Protest on 14 October 1976.

If the union’s opposition was only at the level of rhetoric and the mem¬
bership felt that the controls would still be accepted, workers would have
shown little or no interest in educational material. But because the union
was actually engaged in a struggle, workers sought out this material and dis¬
cussed each wave of bargaining. Leaders wanted to be able to answer mem¬
bers’ questions on whether controls were a good idea, whether they should
be fought, whether they could be fought if they were “the law,” what the
implications of fighting were, and so on.

Moreover, the experience of challenging the controls reminded workers
of the vital importance of their union. Ultimately, the union was really the
only institution they could count on. Companies were, of course, never on
###### their side; governments, as Trudeau showed, couldn’t be trusted; and even the NDP’s record was spotty (the Manitoba and Saskatchewan NDP govern¬
ments supported the controls). But the union was there, fighting the compa¬
nies, the law, and the bureaucracy. It was protecting the wages workers had

###### The CAW and Wage Controls

The controls attack our unions, demand sacrifices by working people, do not
control prices, and do nothing about unemployment or income distribution ...
They represent no ‘alternative’ to real solutions — which would mean
challenging (not reinforcing) corporate power ...

That is why labour opposes controls. That is why, on October 14, UAW
workers will close down their plants and offices as part of the National Day of
Protest called by the Canadian Labour Congress.

— excerpt from UAW Canadian Council Statement on Wage
Controls

Wage controls covered about four million of the ten million workers in
the economy at that time. This included two out of three organized
workers (smaller units were exempt). In the UAW, sixty-five per cent of
agreements (ninety per cent of membership) were covered.

About thirty-five per cent of all workers under controls settled above
the guidelines; for the UAW that percentage was almost seventy-five per
###### cent (fifty-five per cent if we exclude the Big Three, who followed the
American pattern which was slightly above the guidelines but accepted by
###### the AIB).

The goal wasn’t to break the guidelines but to ignore them. There were
about 100 strikes within the union during the program, which ran for less
###### than three years. About half of those strikes didn’t lead to any
involvement by the AIB, either because the settlement occurred early on
when the guidelines were relatively high or because the settlement was
acceptable to the workers even if within the guidelines.

###### A UAW study of 110 non-Big Three agreements (of 121 that exceeded
the guidelines) found that:

      - In seventy per cent of the agreements, covering ninety per cent of
workers, the UAW eventually had the agreement approved or the workers
kept everything they had coming because the union forced the companies
into some “creative” accounting.

###### •In fifteen per cent (six per cent of workers), the union achieved more than the guidelines but did suffer a rollback.

 •The remaining fifteen per cent, covering 1500 workers, who were
generally in smaller units, ended up rolled back to the guidelines (three
cases involved strikes that took them to the highest appeal level under the
program).

heavy-duty equipment suffered a roll-back in spite of their long and bitter
strike — fourteen months — against the controls.

###### In spite of limited successes, the labour movement did not defeat the
controls. The strategy of choosing one particular set of negotiations where
###### the workers had an argument that could attract national support, and rally¬
ing the labour movement around that case as a challenge to the entire pro¬
gram, was never attempted. The trade union leadership was not, it seems,
###### confident enough to aim at defeating rather than just protesting the con¬
trols. The impressive Day of Protest turned out to be an isolated event, and,
###### rather than indicating the beginning of a massive public campaign, it sig¬
nalled the end.

###### Though the number of strikes within the Canadian UAW during the
controls was about the same as in the previous three-year cycle, the overall
###### number of strikes by the Canadian labour movement fell significantly. The rationale for controls had included the repeated arguments that they would
lower inflation and increase jobs. In fact, inflation was higher in the three
years after controls than it was in the period that preceded them. (For one
###### thing, Canadian inflation depended on U.S. inflation.) Unemployment, which had risen in 1974 to a relatively high 6.4 per cent, continued in the
seventies to rise and never again returned to within even one per cent of
###### that “extremely high level.” Wages were reduced, though the more signifi¬ cant impact on wages came with the deep recession of 1979-81. And as the
weaker firms were pushed aside in the restructuring of the economy, profits
###### took off. Future governments returned to controls, but limited them to the
public sector, leaving the market and record unemployment rates to provide
###### the less overt controls in the private sector.

 Concessions: You Don’t Need a Union to Go Backwards

In 1979, Chrysler was in serious financial trouble and the UAW agreed to
###### postpone part of the pattern settlement until later in the agreement. By
early 1980, with Chrysler staring bankruptcy in the face, the American
Congress made long-term worker concessions a condition of loan guarantees
###### to the company. The savings from worker concessions would help to pay off the bank vultures, who faced no corresponding conditions. The American
UAW accepted those conditions but the Canadians rejected them, arguing

###### A year later in January, 1981, Chrysler returned, this time without
Congress but with its own demands and Lee Iacocca’s threat of immediate
###### bankruptcy. The Canadian Chrysler workers, who had been the most com- mitted to ties with the Americans, were now part of an overall union vote. (They were, unlike workers at Ford and GM, part of a formal international agreement.) The result was that Chrysler workers lost their current COLA ($1.15/hour), along with future wage increases and some of their paid time off.

ALL THAT SHINES IN THE DARK IS NOT NECESSARILY CHARITABLE

Today I began negotiations
for a contract at Fleetwood Tool & Mold,
the owner of which informed me,
in an attempt to impress, that he read
the King James version of the bible every day
to improve his writing, invigorate his mind.
Yet, when I asked him to consider
a cost-of-iiving clause for the poorly paid,
he told me he would consult his King Jamie
and get back to me. While I was hoping
for something glorious about the kindness
of strangers, he advanced a curious parable
about the poor someday inheriting the earth,
with only his swelling pinky ring to illuminate the gloom.

Ron Dickson

###### the prelude to the much more important corporate objective of restructuring the workplace to maximize profits.

In the early days of the auto industry, companies had taken advantage of
###### the desperate desire for work by forcing workers to undercut each other. One
of the first goals of unionization was to overcome this competition between
individual workers. After the war, GM was concerned about the bargaining
power of autoworkers. It had initiated the Treaty of Detroit and accepted
“continuous improvement” in workers’ wages and benefits. Soon “continu¬
ous improvement” would take on quite a different meaning. The companies
now wanted to recreate the past competition between workers at a higher
level. Companies pressured employees to compete with workers both at
###### other companies and at different plants within the same company.
 The companies were essentially saying that centralization and considera¬ tion of worker’s concerns may have been tolerated in the past, when workers had bargaining strength and used it to leap frog each other in settlements.
But with the decrease in the relative bargaining power of workers, the com¬
panies had decided to change the rules. They were no longer interested in
###### centralization but in competitive decentralization. Bargaining would no
longer centre on workers’ demands, but company demands.

###### The UAW’s new direction was dangerous in that it robbed the union of

its independent role and virtually transformed it into an industrial-relations
arm of the companies. The union was now selling the company line and ide¬


-----

###### had negotiated too well before and would never negotiate that forcefully
again? If GM and Ford needed help, who didn’t? If the union believed work¬
ers needed to work harder for less, then why was a union necessary? As one
exasperated worker said, “We don’t need a union to walk backwards; we can
give things up just as easily on our own ...”

###### The dynamic of the union endorsement of concessions undermined
every facet of the union’s life: its outward stance, its internal democracy, its
###### educational structures. By accepting concessions, the union allowed the companies to shift the focus of America’s problems on to workers’ shoulders. The public debate centred on whether autoworkers would make conces¬
sions, and this emphasis diverted attention from more fundamental causes of
###### the industry’s problems: high interest rates and the banks; the corporate fail¬
ure to build small, quality vehicles; the overvalued dollar (and undervalued
yen); and the diversion of resources and skills to the military, which reflect¬
ed the competitive costs of America’s imperial role.

against reopening their agreement before it expired and, even when they
were softened up by union-company pressures, forty-eight per cent still
###### voted against the concessions. Because of such resistance, the insecure union leadership interfered with the workers’ ability to collectively deal with these questions across workplaces and companies.
 In 1982 for example, the scheduled Collective Bargaining Conference, the purpose of which was to set the general directions for all sections of the union, was cancelled. Locals that defied the leadership were isolated and
weakened with threats and rumours of their plants being next on the closure
list. Union democracy could hardly flourish in such an environment; the
roles of union education and the development of activism also faded in this
###### context.

These events should not obscure the pressures faced by the Americans.
###### The industry was confronting its greatest crisis in over half a century. It was
becoming increasingly common to hear rumours that the auto industry was
essentially dead in North America and that autoworkers should all move on.
###### American autoworkers, earning almost fifty per cent more than the average
worker in manufacturing (plus far superior benefits), attracted little public
sympathy for their wage losses. The UAW members themselves were acutely
aware that even a lower-paying auto job was much better than other alter¬
natives. Politically, the right was on the rise; the union was therefore even
###### further isolated in terms of hopes for more meaningful alternatives.
 This situation was part of a more general economic and social transi¬ tion taking place in the United States in the seventies and eighties. The U.S. had, since the late sixties, experienced a relative loss in stature as international competitors eroded its once dominant status. In the late sev¬ enties, two events symbolized America’s frustration: the Japanese were making inroads into the most American of all products — the car — and a Third World country, Iran, held Americans hostage while the U.S. sat helpless, watching CNN with the rest of the world. Furthermore, the Soviet Union had just invaded Afghanistan, and this was used to rekindle the cold war.

Reagan emerged with the promise to restore the “good old days,” when
America, as the undisputed leader in all things important, was shown proper
respect, and when Americans knew they would achieve a standard of living
###### that exceeded their parents’. That nostalgia included making American
industry Number One again, which left the companies in a powerful posi¬


-----

vously hoped that they might at least keep their jobs, while also wondering
###### about the costs of doing so.

It would certainly have been extremely difficult for the UAW to avoid
losses in this period. But losses are one thing — workers don’t always have
###### the strength to win their demands — and concession bargaining is another. This new direction was defined not by its defeats, but by the refusal to fight, and the rationalization of those defeats as “victories.” The UAW had, over the years, suffered a major decline in its ability to act as a social movement;
now it was surrendering its most basic economic role as a bargaining agent.
###### A temporary defeat (lower wages) therefore became a long-term change in direction (selling concessions).

 No to Giving Up and Giving Back

 The Canadian UAW rejected the direction of its parent organization. The context in which the Canadians made their decisions was no doubt more
favourable than that facing the Americans. Auto lay-offs were not as severe,
###### the national mood had not yet shifted to the right, and the union was sim¬
ply not as isolated economically, politically, and socially. Canadian Big
###### Three wages were about twenty-five per cent above the national average, half the gap between American autoworkers and the rest of their communi¬

ty. The Canadian movement was more highly unionized and aggressive. The
###### NDP provided a countervoice that the Americans didn’t have. And Canadian nationalism, unlike American nationalism, allowed for much
more skepticism over the claims and demands of American-based multina¬
tionals.

###### At the same time, however, the 1981-82 recession was deeper in Canada than in any other major developed country. Canadian autoworkers, like their American counterparts, faced a daily barrage of warnings that the auto
industry was now a dying industry which could only continue to exist with
fewer jobs that would go to those who worked harder for less. Fighting con¬
cessions wasn’t easy; workers had seen far too many closures to write off any
###### threats as mere posturing. Brantford, for example, once ranked behind only Toronto and Montreal as a centre of heavy industry. It was quickly being
wiped off the industrial map, but workers never stopped fighting. When cor¬
###### porations tried to take advantage of the desperation in the community in the early eighties Canadian UAW members went on strike at Trailmobile a


-----

###### trailer manufacturer, for over eight months and at Hussman, which supplied
store equipment, for nine months. Concessions were successfully resisted.

###### At least as important as the corporate threats was the uncertainty of the Canadian UAW’s ability to venture in a direction entirely different from that of the Americans. Would the parent tolerate an independent direction?
Would it view the Canadian example as reinforcing the opposition to the
###### American leadership? If the American UAW made concessions, could Canadians who worked for American companies reject that direction with- out risking their jobs? Did the Canadians have the collective bargaining strength to stand up to the auto companies if the Big Three really decided to
take them on?

###### In early 1982, the Canadians made the key decision — the one that launched the eventual breakaway from the Americans. The Canadian UAW
chose to break ranks with the Americans and reject an early opening of the
###### agreements with Ford and GM. Under the leadership of Bob White, the union saw the basic danger of concession bargaining: if the union consented
to participate, it would collapse from internal conflicts and nullify its role as
a social force within the Canadian labour movement and in Canadian soci¬
ety. The risk of fighting for traditional bargaining had to be taken.

###### This decision wasn’t made in an intellectual vacuum, but in the context
of the momentum against concessions that was already growing in the union

by that time. The fight against concessions had begun during the struggle
over wage controls. It continued after controls at places such as Kenworth,
###### the manufacturer of heavy-duty trucks in Montreal, where workers stayed on
strike for nine and a half months to reject concessions and make gains. Less
successful, but still crucial to sending a message to corporations about the
union’s determination to fight was the twenty-two month strike and boycott
of Blue Cross, the supplier of medical insurance.

###### The issue of concessions intensified after the concessions to Chrysler, when the independent parts units of the Canadian UAW confronted
employers who were “whipsawing”: demanding concessions in one unit,
arguing in a competing unit that those concessions be matched or surpassed

if workers wanted to keep their jobs, then telling the first unit that it was
###### underbid and inviting those workers to start the merry-go-round of conces¬
sions again.

###### The union response was reinforced by educational, especially in the
Paid Education Leave (PEL) Program negotiated at the end of the seventies.


-----

###### treatment of workers, a more comprehensive strategy was developed. It
began with a declaration that the national office, which was the signatory to
all UAW agreements in Canada, would not sign any agreements that were
###### opened in mid-term to make concessions. The potential chaos of units opening up their agreements to undercut each other had to be stopped immediately. As a result, local decisions that might have been reached democratically could now be overridden. The justification was the authority of the Canadian Council, a broader democratic forum which took into con¬ sideration the negative implications of individual local decisions on all UAW locals in Canada.
 Where locals entered into new agreements, as opposed to mid-term
reopeners, the union was reluctant to set the precedent of taking away any
unit’s ratification rights. Thus, the no-concessions policy was enforced in
###### much the same way as in the fight against wage controls: through the distri¬ bution of educational material on why making concessions propelled work¬
ers into a no-win rat race to the bottom; through community meetings with
###### bargaining committees and stewards; and through of the union’s staff, who
were responsible for bringing that policy into each set of negotiations and
###### supporting any reluctant committees.

###### Paid Education Leave

 The Canadian UAW Education Centre housed the PEL program, which was first negotiated in 1977 at Rockwell. It was initiated by Education Director Gord Wilson, after a fact-finding trip to Europe and was especially inspired by the educational work done within the Swedish trade union movement. Dan Benedict, an early advocate for
PEL within both the North American and international trade union
###### movements, was asked to come on the Canadian staff to develop and implement the program.
 The political orientation of the program — its orientation to under¬ standing the economy and addressing broad social change — had roots going back to the forties. The immediate drive to put the new program into place came from the top. Union policy was that no staff rep could take it off the table without authorization from the Canadian director’s office. Once negotiated, a committee that includes the local and the education department chooses the students to attend the course. As of 1995, some 5,000 workers had gone through the four-week course. The uniqueness of PEL lies in its combination of the following elements:

 1. Ideological Orientation

 The PEL program wasn’t set up to provide bargaining and contract- administration skills but to contribute the background for using and developing such skills. PEL aims at providing working people with an understanding of capitalism, their place in this system, the role of unions as independent working class organizations, the history of work¬
ers and their organizations, and the principles and philosophy of the
###### Canadian UAW. The program’s goal is to develop future activists with a commitment to the union and to progressive change.

 2. Adult Education

 The course includes lectures but is biased towards group discussions in a comfortable atmosphere. PEL provides workers with an opportunity to


-----

use and develop their intellectual skills as they discuss the major eco¬
###### nomic and social issues of the times.

 3. Peer Training

 The PEL program includes a program administrator and brings in staff,
activists, and academics to share their knowledge and experience. But
###### the main teaching load falls to over 100 local union discussion leaders
who come from CAW plants and offices and have been trained to lead
###### the learning process.

 4. Blocks of Education

 The basic program is four weeks, though recently one- and two-week
programs were introduced. The shorter programs allow for more spe¬
cialized courses such as work reorganization, health and safety, compet¬
###### itiveness, workers’ compensation, and leadership development for women and people of colour.

 5. Residential

 While some courses occur off-site, the main courses take place at the CAW Family Education Centre. The advantages of making the courses residential come from workers being at their own place with its rich
history and the opportunity to continue the education informally out¬
side of the classroom.

###### 6. Company-Paid

 The program’s financing is negotiated from the companies, though the
program is completely administered by the union. The original contri¬
###### butions per worker were one cent per hour worked (enough to get start¬
ed) and now range up to three cents per hour.

for other workers to be tested. In general, the no-concessions fight of the
council was successful, particularly in its ability to support units in a weaker
bargaining position.

Two other kinds of confrontations, dealing with concessions of a differ¬
###### ent kind, reinforced the confidence and militant mood in the Canadian
region: the fight for union security at Fleck Manufacturing, a producer of
wire harnesses for the auto industry, and a series of plant take-overs which
were part of a larger attempt to deal with the growing number of plant clo¬
sures. Both events drew national attention because of the issues involved,
###### the response of the authorities, and the fact that they were really political battles led by the direct actions of workers outside of Parliament.
 At Fleck, eighty per cent of the workforce voted in 1977 to join the
UAW. The plant manager promptly notified the workers that the company

workers — generally young women, many single mothers, and all low-paid
— faced the option of conceding or going on strike. Three days before the
nervous workers were to begin picketing, they were called to the lunch¬
room, where an Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) officer read them the sec¬
tions of the Criminal Code dealing with the illegality of workers threaten¬
ing or intimidating anyone; he did not read them their rights to picket
peacefully. Eighty of the women went on strike; forty felt threatened and
were sufficiently intimidated to stay at work.

was a top official in Premier Bill Davis’s office.

###### The strike lasted for five months. Bus loads of activists from other UAW
locals and from other unions came as morale boosters to completely shut¬
down the plant from time to time. The women’s movement mobilized pickets
to keep the profile of the strike high. Community artists donated their time
to a unique cultural event and show of solidarity across unions. The Fleck
strike became a rallying point for the fight over union security, a fight that

Woodworkers and the Canadian Textile and Chemical Union in the early
seventies, and at Radio Shack and the Steelworkers shortly before Fleck.

###### government of Ontario legislated union security (the Rand formula).

In the summer of 1980, the increasingly common plant closures became
an issue at the Canadian Council, and that forum galvanized a response. As
speaker after speaker told stories of lost jobs and destroyed lives, the frustra¬
###### tion grew into anger, and the anger, into a search for actions. As Bob White
stepped up to the podium to conclude the debate, he looked around the hall
and grimly declared: “If it takes occupations of plants to stop this ... then

we’ll occupy them.” On the return trip, the delegates from the Houdaille
bumper plant in Oshawa and others who had been told their plant would
close separately discussed their options and reached their own conclusions.

###### In early August, the council delegates appeared before the premier of Ontario and key cabinet members to argue — to no avail — for legislation
governing plant closures. The brief had called for expropriation of any plant
###### that didn’t justify its decision and deal fairly with its workers. But the next
morning, 8 August, 1980, a more effective “presentation” was made to the
premier: the Houdaille workers took over the Oshawa plant and renamed it

workers took over Beach Appliances in Ottawa, and Bendix and Windsor

###### In terms of plants remaining open, only the Windsor Bumper take-over
was successful. Often, the experience simply left workers more aware of the
limits on their power. Having taken the most radical of steps and seized the
owner’s property, they were confronted with the question of “What next?”
###### Nobody offered easy answers. Preventing or reversing closures required much broader changes in the economy and in society. However, where
workers did act, they made gains: if nothing else, their severance pay and/or
###### pensions were increased. Other workers benefited to the extent that

 The issue of concessions ultimately centred on the future of the auto
majors. Because of the high profile of the Big Three negotiations, those talks
would set the pattern and mood for the future direction of the Canadian
UAW. If the union had, however, allowed concessions in other places, the
fight at the auto majors would have been weakened if not undermined. But

fidence that fighting back actually mattered

###### he exuberant challenges to the status quo of the sixties had not T changed the world, and as the excitement gave way to disillusionment, the corporations began a much longer-lasting and successful counterrevolu¬ tion. Facing greater competition from Europe and Japan, the economic and political elite emphasized the need to keep prices down in order to remain competitive. This plan translated in the mid-seventies into pressures on
workers to accept lower wages, though it would later be extended to tougher
working conditions along with the wage restraint.

In the U.S., the labour movement had lost its ability to lead any serious
resistance, and as the eighties arrived even the UAW had ceased to be an
###### independent voice challenging corporate morality and corporate actions. The Canadian left did not escape this malaise, yet Canada’s labour move¬ ment retained a breath of defiance, and the gap between the Canadian and American labour movements grew in terms of both membership numbers and direction. The economic strength of Canadian workers in the seventies — their ability to resist the corporate pressures for concessions — was not,
however, matched by any corresponding political strength. The government
was thus able to introduce legislated wage controls to accomplish what the
###### private sector did not. And in order to increase the likelihood of those con¬
trols being successful, economic policy allowed unemployment, and there¬
fore worker insecurity, to rise.

###### At the end of the seventies, with the deepening of the recession, the
pressures for wage concessions intensified. The leadership of the American
###### UAW accepted the logic of concessions. The Canadian leadership, both leading and reflecting the mood of its members, rejected concession bar¬ gaining. For the Canadian section of the UAW, past tensions with the Americans could always be attributed to internal union politics (e.g., Canadian opposition to profit sharing in the late fifties), strong disagree¬ ments over a specific but unique problem (United Aircraft in the seventies),
or different national circumstances (the contrasting roles of the two govern¬
###### ments in responding to Chrysler’s possible bankruptcy). But once the issue
became the direction of the union’s primary activity — bargaining — and
###### that issue pitted the entire Canadian region against the top leadership of the
UAW, a change in the relationship between the American and Canadian
###### sections of the UAW became increasingly likely.

###### PART FOUR: TOWARDS A NEW UNIONISM

In dealing with concessions, the Canadian UAW’s goal

was to defend its members and maintain the integrity of

its organization. But the very refusal to change
fundamental principles led it to the most fundamental of

changes in its structure: a break with its parent

organization (Chapter 8). That change led to further

dramatic changes in the regional and sectoral

composition of the union (Chapter 9). Along with the

volatile economic and social climate of the times, these

developments confronted the Canadians with new

questions regarding direction and structure (Chapter
###### 10).

In the early eighties, when globalization was quickly becoming something-
###### not-to-be-questioned, the Canadian section of the UAW stubbornly
embarked on a direction that went against the tide of economic change,
against the apparent end of nationalism, and even against its own history
(only a decade earlier, it had been the staunchest defender of international
unionism). Given the extreme and growing integration of the industry, did
###### the Canadian split amount to anything more than a symbolic move? And
where would this new direction ultimately take the new union?

###### Globalization, Nationalism, and Internationalism

In Canada’s case, globalization was hardly new; it essentially meant “conti-
nentalism” — further integration into the U.S. economy and, courtesy of
###### American interests, an eventual move towards also bringing Mexico into that relationship. Despite the apparent inevitability of this trend, Canadians put up resistance well into the eighties. Even the federal Liberals had
included nationalist elements in their policies during the early eighties (the
###### National Energy Policy and the Foreign Investment Review Agency), and,
of course, there was the massive mobilization against free trade in the mid-
to late eighties.

###### In contrast to the popular resistance to globalization and continental-
ism, a unique favourable consensus had emerged within business. In the
past, those in the business world in Canada had always been divided on the
issues of free trade and nationalism, depending on whether they were con¬
###### cerned with protecting domestic markets or searching for foreign markets.
However, by the eighties, no significant division remained. Big business

was united on the free trade issue and small business fell into step behind
###### that leadership. In spite of the feelings of some individual capitalists, not one section of business was part of the anti-free trade alliance. In fact, it
was becoming very difficult to define the term Canadian as it applied to
business.

###### The Mulroney Tories became the vehicle through which big business defeated nationalist-leaning policies and, by way of the FTA, essentially achieved the constitutionalized economic integration into the United
States. But even the Tories recognized the antagonism across the country; in
###### the campaign that preceded the move towards the FTA, they knew enough
to keep a safe distance from continentalism.

###### This popular opposition wasn’t based solely on abstract nationalism: it

was a result of the fact that the United States, once a model of the good life,
no longer held much appeal. Further economic integration with the U.S.
###### might be viewed as unavoidable from the perspective of uncertainty and
fear, but it hardly had the power to move people with its promises and
vision. The role of autoworkers in the economy placed the union at the cen¬
tre of the debate on globalization and further integration into the United
States; the response of the union placed it at the centre of the oppositional
movement.

By the mid-seventies, the integration of the Canadians into the UAW
and the American economy seemed complete: wages were virtually equal,
###### the industry was more integrated than any other cross-border industry in the
world, and the opposition to this integration had apparently collapsed. But
during this period, Canadian workers began to shift the focus of their bar¬
###### gaining from the United States to Canada. Having achieved wage parity with the Americans, Canadians lost interest in catching up with the
Americans.

In the past, Canadian UAW members, attempting to steadily improve
###### their living standards, turned first to bargaining and then to national politi¬
cal action. The promise of the good life through collective bargaining was
###### the ultimate lure of ties to the American union. But the situation had changed in two ways. First, as the postwar period of relative security and sharing in steady growth ended, the importance of bargaining seemed to diminish in relation to political events. Recession and restraint shifted union attention towards job policies and industrial strategies, legislated
wage controls, labour laws as they affected organizing, and employment
standards as they influenced health and safety and plant closures. To deal
###### with such issues required addressing domestic politics; Canadians had to adopt a national perspective. For the Canadian UAW, building new ties with Canadian workers became more important than reinforcing the ties to American labour.
 Second, even in bargaining itself — which remains a crucial element
even as the significance of the political climate grows — the American lead¬
ership role was waylaid. The relative weakness of American labour, compared
to the general militancy of the Canadian movement in this period, led to the
greater attraction of wage comparisons within Canada over those in the U.S.
It was in the process of bargaining, the raison d’etre of unions, that the issues
of Canadian autonomy and union direction came to a head.


-----

###### The corporations had responded to the intensified competition they faced (and encouraged via free trade and capital mobility) with a new belligerence
towards their workers. The companies, with auto in the lead, had made the
###### transformation of collective bargaining relationships a crucial part of their
overall strategy. The general disenchantment amongst Canadians with the
###### American model was matched within the Canadian UAW by a growing dis¬ illusionment with the American union’s response to this attack. The differ¬ ence in the response of the Canadian UAW to the same corporate assault led
to the split inside the UAW.

###### This conflict between the union and its parent organization reflected national differences, but more important, it stemmed from divergent strate¬
gies and notions of the role of unions. The Canadians were challenging the
logic of globalization in a way that was both nationalist and concerned with
###### the purpose of nationalism. Had the Canadian UAW even reluctantly adopted the American response, the union would have become just another vehicle for bringing American ideology and directions into Canada. Alternatively, since these differences over direction also existed to some extent within Canada, the UAW would have become a mechanism for rein¬ forcing the weakest tendencies within Canadian labour. Instead, the Canadian UAW was able to retain its leading role in the labour movement and in broader struggles such as the fight against free trade.
 The direction of the Canadian UAW seemed, however, to undermine the historic internationalism of progressive unionism. According to interna¬ tionalists, corporate internationalism was based on competitiveness, while
worker internationalism was based on solidarity. This definition was true,
###### yet it skirted key problems. The international labour movement was too
diverse to effectively coordinate activities. Each national labour movement
was rooted in its distinct stage of development. Each movement faced a dif¬
###### ferent context, and each was separated by cultural and ideological differ¬
ences. These variations became most obvious in the difficulties encountered
by Canada and the United States in their attempts to develop practical
cross-border strategies. These problems arose in spite of the countries’ rela¬
tively similar language and culture.

But more important, international solidarity couldn’t work unless each of
###### the labour movements became stronger. New kinds of international solidari¬
ty are not compatible with a reality that includes an American labour move¬
###### ment that has been unable to organize its own “South”; a Mexican labour movement in which workers at different auto plants within the same corn-


-----

pany can’t even communicate with each other; and a Canadian movement
###### that can’t organize the fastest-growing sectors (private service).
 Under these circumstances, if labour wants to challenge the internation¬ alism of the corporations, it must first be strong nationally. However, national strength does not simply mean strong national governments. Such governments legislated wage controls, imposed the FTA, skewed taxes
against working people, and forced cut-backs in the social wage on the gen¬
eral population (“for its own good”). Similarly, national strength means
more than allegedly strong unions. Unions that are strong enough to sell
wage concessions and false partnerships will reinforce rather than challenge
###### the view that there is no alternative.
 Rather, national strength requires local and national institutions — unions, community organizations, political parties, and the service and
administrative bodies within the various levels of the state — that are acces¬
sible to working people, and that are democratic and effective. These insti¬
###### tutions must be able to articulate working class needs and fight on behalf of
and alongside workers in their struggles. Only on such a national base can
###### internationalism be meaningfully achieved.
 While the Canadians were breaking away from the international union (which was really an American-based union with a Canadian section) and concentrating on building a strong national union and national movement, the CAW also increased its commitment to internationalism. After the
split, the CAW channelled more resources into international education
###### and the enforcement of solidarity, especially through its ties to the South African labour movement, South and Central America, and (later)
 Mexico. In bargaining, the
 union negotiated a compa¬

 The struggles in other countries would be fought on a national basis, and the role of internationalism was both modest and indirect: to attract nation¬
al and international attention to issues, to provide financial assistance and
###### technical and moral support, and to act nationally to limit the power and
ideology of capital. If Canadians and American autoworkers could resist
###### their employers’ attempts to speed up the line, Volkswagen workers in
Mexico would face less pressure to work at a pace that forced forty-year-olds
###### into involuntary retirement. If Canadians could challenge the logic of com¬ petitiveness (rather than try to compete with fellow workers in other coun¬
tries), then workers in South Africa would feel less isolated when they also
resisted that logic. In essence, progressive internationalism can only be built
###### on a strong and progressive nationalism.

 Confidence and Independence

 Given the pressures of globalization and the dependent relationship that had existed within the union and Canada for so long, how did the Canadian UAW develop the self-confidence to attempt a split from its par¬ ent organization?
 Unions do not set out explicitly to develop confidence. On the contrary, concrete issues and struggles absorb their time and energy. And while educa¬ tional campaigns and policies can help, it is the struggles themselves, rather than any prearranged plan, that build collective confidence. Yet building confidence contributes to no less than building the potential of the union to
survive attacks and initiate progress. In a sense, the entire history of the
###### Canadian UAW centres on the development of that potential amongst its

activists and members.

As Big Three bargaining developed in the early eighties, each step fur¬
###### ther escalated the stakes and each success seemed to build the Canadian
UAW’s ability and confidence to act independently. As pointed out earli¬

er, struggles outside the Big Three — against wage controls, with anti¬
###### union employers, over plant closures and wage concessions — set the stage
for the Canadian UAW’s decision in early spring of 1982 to reject the
###### American proposal of opening the Ford and GM collective agreements. In


-----

###### direction was relatively easy to uphold, since it didn’t require the Canadians to go on strike or risk immediate retaliation. The real test was
to come when the agreements expired and the alternative was a strike;
would the companies let them get away with trying to achieve more than
###### the Americans?
 The mood within the labour movement was sombre and even sympa¬ thetic; reporters were writing articles on the defeat of labour. An editorial in the Financial Times in April, 1980, warned against any economic stimulus. The economic establishment was determined to let the 1979 recession con¬ tinue as a crucial part of the fight against inflation and to break the resis¬ tance of the stubborn labour movement. In the early eighties, unemploy¬ ment was higher in Canada than in any other developed capitalist country.
 And in the auto industry, a report by Ross Perry, The Future of Canada’s
Auto Industry, summarized the prevailing pessimism: “Two recent studies
predicted a reduction [in jobs] in the range of 30 and 50 per cent from the
peak employment year 1978 to the mid-1980s. This amounts to a loss of
###### between 29,000 and 41,000 direct wage-earning jobs. These forecasts are
based on conservative assumptions ...” In this context, unions were wonder¬

however, one thing to ask workers to “do their part” and another to threaten
###### entire communities with devastation if they didn’t comply. Rather than mobilizing public support, the comments sparked a public backlash (in future, GM and other companies laid the groundwork for their demands with slightly more sophistication).
 The lay-offs in the industry, especially the scheduled weeks of downtime,
were so pervasive during the 1982 negotiations that the union had difficulty
###### finding a strike deadline during which even half the workers would be work¬
ing. On the dates that would have been the normal deadline at Ford, for
example, no assembly plant was scheduled to work. The union took a cau¬
tious position: it recognized not only that times were difficult, but also that
###### it faced an environment that differed from the American one (e.g., Canadian inflation was higher). The union had done its homework; it pub¬
licly took advantage of GM’s vulnerable position as a foreign multinational.
###### It also sent the clear message to the company that it would settle if the com¬
pany made a reasonable offer, but that it was ready to fight if GM forced it
###### to the wall.
 General Motors decided that a war would be too costly and settled with¬ out a strike. It succeeded in removing the PPH program from the agreement, though the Canadian agreements retained it slightly longer than those of the Americans. The company did not ask the Canadians to repay the COLA that workers had retained by not reopening, and the Canadians won
a small wage increase, over and above COLA. The Canadians breathed a
sigh of relief. Their gains were modest, but they had challenged the Big
###### Three collective bargaining system — including both the companies and their own union — and survived.
 Unfortunately, the feelings of relief were short-lived. A dispute at Chrysler followed, and the Chrysler workers stated their demands in
absolute terms. They had lost $1.15 per hour when the concessions agree¬
###### ment removed COLA. Other catch-up demands could wait; the workers wanted first and foremost to reinstate COLA. Chrysler had offered the American workers a continuation of the agreement with future COLA but without the restoration of the lost COLA and other wage increases. The
workers rejected the agreement by a vote of two to one but the union lead¬
ership convinced them that a strike would be suicidal. They therefore ended

up in limbo, with no agreement and no strike.

workers that the cupboard was bare. With the added authority of President
Doug Fraser’s vantage point on Chrysler’s board of directors, the UAW was
###### telling the Canadians that their demands were unreasonable. An increase

as small as twenty-five cents per hour would push Chrysler into bankrupt¬
cy and cause the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs. If the Canadians
###### demanded more, Chrysler might actually do what GM had only threat¬ ened — leave Canada.
 The Canadian UAW’s analysis concluded that the wage issue had little or nothing to do with Chrysler’s survival. The key was economic recovery and
Chrysler’s ability to return to full-capacity utilization. Nor did it make sense
for Chrysler to move out of Canada. Relocation would be extremely costly,
and the company could make substantial profits in Canada even at the wages
###### the workers insisted on. Nevertheless, Chrysler did have the power to carry
out any decision it made, and the Canadians had no guarantees.

###### The leadership decided the risk was necessary, and the membership
simultaneously made it clear — by way of wildcats, at membership meetings,
###### and through their bargaining committees — that it wouldn’t accept any other decision. The strike began on 5 November 1982. During the Chrysler
strike, newspaper reporters had been told by their editors to balance the sto¬
ries by finding breaks in solidarity. But the reporters were themselves sur¬
prised at the degree of support for the strike on the picket lines and at the
workers’ ability to argue against concessions and justify demands. The soli¬
darity of the workers was overwhelming across all the Canadian units.

Chrysler’s expectation that pressure on the workers would weaken the

history while paying wages that were higher than those it had earlier warned
would result in bankruptcy.

###### The Chrysler strike had “really done it.” The Canadians had achieved something that the American union was not only unable to do, but had in
fact given up on. They had also shown that they could generate the pressure
necessary to force the Americans to come to Canada and negotiate on the
basis of Canadian demands. Along the way, they proved that their analysis
###### and intuition were correct, while the experts (including the union leader¬
ship in the U.S.) were wrong. The Canadian David had been smarter and
###### tougher than the American Goliath, and even non-union Canadians


-----

###### Then came the 1984 bargaining round. General Motors had settled in the U.S. with no real wage increases built into the agreement (the ratifica- tion vote was only fifty-seven per cent). The Canadians decided to target
GM again. Chrysler had not yet been brought back to pattern (i.e., parity
###### with GM and Ford) so it wasn’t an option. Since Ford hadn’t yet settled in the U.S., targeting Ford risked entanglement in the American strategy. If,
for example, the U.S. went on strike while Canada was already on strike,
###### the Canadians could be left hanging until the Americans had settled. This
vulnerability was the last thing the Canadian union needed.

###### This time, the confrontation dealt with who had ultimate authority over the bargaining program in Canada — the Canadian director or the UAW
president. The 1982 GM settlement in Canada had been reached without a
strike, and the American leadership had rationalized the differences in terms
of higher Canadian inflation and the profit-sharing plans, negotiated by the
###### Americans and rejected by the Canadians. At Chrysler later that year, the
Americans disagreed with the timing of the Canadian demands (i.e., imme¬
###### diate restoration of the COLA float) but they couldn’t criticize the Canadians’ ultimate goal: bringing Chrysler back to parity with GM and
Ford. Now, however, the union was involved in pattern bargaining for the
###### entire Canadian auto industry. The Canadians were asserting independence
and, by their actions, essentially saying to American workers, who were
themselves questioning the leadership of their union, “Hey! You don’t have
to go down that road!”

It is possible to imagine the two sections of the union simply deciding to
###### follow their own agendas within the same international union. Other unions seemed to have managed this arrangement. However, this plan was not an option given the specific nature of the UAW as an organization, and the lack of consensus within the American section on its own direction. There is no other example in the history of bargaining of a relationship that

is as integrated as that between Canada and the U.S. in the Big Three nego¬
###### tiations. In fact, there are very few domestic industries with such integrated bargaining. Workers doing the same job have generally earned the same
wage, whether they worked for GM, Ford, or Chrysler and whether they
worked in Canada or the United States. In the past, rigid wage parity was a
source of strength for the workers on both sides of the border; at a time of
strain, it became an inflexibility that the structure couldn’t handle.

To be more accurate, the structure invited, comparisons. It was those com¬
###### parisons that the American leadership rather than the union structure


-----

couldn’t handle. The American leadership, in its attempt to sell the new
###### direction, was meeting stiff resistance from American workers; the last thing
it wanted was a Canadian presence that highlighted this resistance at con¬
###### ventions and intercorporate conferences, and most of all by their bargaining directions and outcomes.
 The bargaining with GM Canada was unsuccessful, in part because the American UAW leadership warned GM to limit what it gave to the Canadians. The Canadians went on strike — nervous and very apprehensive
about the high stakes, and with

 In the past, the corporations usually retained excess capacity to meet sudden increases in demand, and they often had the luxury of double¬
sourcing: if one plant shut down, another could pick up some of the slack.
But as the companies cut overhead to save costs, this flexibility also disap¬
###### peared. And as they reduced duplication, increased specialization, and
moved to just-in-time production, many groups of workers were left with the
power to affect a disproportionately wide range of a company’s operations.
###### The Canadian strike made this power especially clear, as 50,000 American
workers were soon laid off, with more to follow.

###### The catch was that the companies retained the power to move those cru¬
cial parts of their operations, though at some cost, to locations where the
workers were under “better control.” As a result, the Canadians had both

###### The union had to balance its demands, taking corporate warnings of com- petitive limits with a grain of salt, but also aware that the threats were not
just propaganda.

###### In the long term, that balance could be shifted in the workers’ favour
only if national and international legislation limited corporate mobility, and
###### if workers’ militancy became more generalized on a global basis. International ad hoc militancy — with or without formal international links
— would at least leave the corporations nervous about the expense of relo¬
###### cation with the possible rise of militancy at the new site.
 The Canadian leadership made it clear that whether or not its strike was
approved by the parent organization, it would strike for the right to share in
###### the industry’s growth in productivity. The solidarity of the workers was
strong, and after a thirteen-day strike, GM conceded annual improvements
for each year of the agreement. This increase wasn’t labelled the traditional
AIF, but was renamed “special Canadian adjustment” (SCA) and added to
###### COLA rather than the base rate; like COLA and the base rate, the SCA

was included in calculating overtime, premiums, vacation pay, etc. The rea¬
son for this creative introduction of yet another initialism into the agree¬
###### ment was to obscure the visibility of the Canadian gains and limit the
antagonism of the American UAW. The workers ratified the agreement by a
###### vote of almost six to one.
 The GM strike confirmed the ability of the Canadian UAW to act inde¬ pendently in the most difficult of circumstances. The union had taken on the largest manufacturing company in the world and shown that, in spite of
globalization, workers had a measure of power. The workers had confronted
###### their own union and established their own Canadian pattern. The face of the union now wore a giddy smile. That smile mixed pride, surprise at the
union’s progress, growing self-confidence, and nervousness about the ulti¬
mate step of permanently separating from the international union and past
dependency.

###### The Split

Detroit’s interference in the Canadian negotiations made future change in
###### the bargaining relationship inevitable. The bargaining successes were obvi¬
ously crucial in allaying the apprehension that remained, but also critical
was the role played by the Canadian director Bob White


-----

###### White had many of the attributes of other leaders: he was clever and bright, articulate, astute in sizing up both people and situations, and he rev¬ elled in responsibility and tough decisions. Like all leaders in the UAW, he had been significantly influenced by the social unionism of Walter Reuther. Although originally opposed to Dennis McDermott’s appointment as direc¬ tor of the Canadian region, White worked closely with McDermott and credited him with influencing White’s own social perspectives.
 White’s greatest attribute was that he clearly understood who he repre¬ sented. Electoral politics was very important, but always secondary to the impact of any policy or event on working people and the union. The work¬ ers and their union were the foundation of both bargaining and future polit¬ ical strength. His personal ties to the international leadership were painful to break, but he would never let those ties stand in the way of his represent¬ ing Canadian workers.
 Robert White was the first (and only) Canadian labour leader to become a media star; he was a nationalist speaking for the underdog, youthful and open. He respected the media, understood it, and used it, but he never over¬ estimated it or became overly dependent on its judgements. He spoke to the members through the media, and the status the media conferred on White was shared by the membership. Through the news clips of White speaking to and often even on behalf of Canadians, UAW activists and members began to see themselves as leading a fight that extended beyond their inter¬ ests to a broader national arena. White had not intended to make history by leading a breakaway from the international union. His great contribution as a leader was that when the historic opportunity did arise, he didn’t try to escape from it.
 White had decided to go to the Canadian Council in early December to Of the union’s two living garner support for autonomy demands past directors, Dennis from the international union. (White McDermott strongly sup¬

 gaining conference would set Canadian goals, and that the control over the right to strike, over access to the strike fund, and over Canadian staff would rest with the Canadian director.) Just before the council meeting, White called a meeting to inform the staff of his inten¬ tions and to test the waters. The six-hour session included arguments for


-----

As Bob White was the first to point out, the role he played in the union
was critically dependent on Bob Nickerson and Buzz Hargrove, his two
trouble-shooters and assistants. Most unions would have envied having
either one of these individuals as their leader. Their differing styles and
roots complemented each other. Both brought close ties to the rank-and-
file to any discussion and never shied away from challenging, pushing, or
restraining White according to their views of the union.

Nickerson, who subsequently became the CAW’s first secretary-
treasurer, had, as a service rep, played an often unrecognized role in
developing local activists. As an assistant, he played a particularly
important role within the labour movement in supporting the early
struggles of women to break through barriers within the male-dominated
union structures.

Hargrove joined the staff in the mid-seventies and immediately
became active in the two most pressing issues of the time: organizing the
unemployed and fighting worker concessions, including wage controls.
Hargrove was in his early thirties and had been on staff for less than three
years when White became director. Nevertheless, White acknowledged
his potential by choosing him as an assistant.

###### impressive overall commitment of the staff members to press ahead in spite of any risks to themselves — their paycheques came from Detroit — rein¬ forced White’s determination and strengthened the resolution he took to the council. As was happening in the union overall, the struggle over the future of the Canadian UAW had unified the staff and brought out the best in them.
 The debate at the council was equally impressive. Some delegates made passionate appeals for international solidarity and historic ties, and a few questioned whether the union could survive on its own. But the delegates had been through enough over the past few years to clearly understand that they had to assert their autonomy. No one really expected Detroit’s reaction to lead to anything but a split. The only questions for most delegates were when the split would occur and under what conditions.
 When, as expected, the international executive board rejected those con¬ ditions, White returned to the council on 11 December 1984- The Canadian union’s “parliament” decided that day, virtually unanimously, to establish a new Canadian union. Of 350 delegates, only four voted against the decision.

were included for two women and one person of colour. To limit potential
###### bureaucratization, only three officers would hold full-time positions: the president, the secretary-treasurer, and the Quebec director. Since the remaining officers would retain their current union functions, officers
would, in some cases, continue to work on a part-time or full-time basis in
###### the workplace.

Because the two large locals in Quebec themselves could dominate any
###### vote in Quebec and thereby choose one of the NEB members, the overall convention formally elected the Quebec director. In fact, this “safety valve”
was never used; the elected Quebec caucus member was rubber-stamped by
###### the delegates in recognition of Quebec’s unique status. This procedure was later modified so that Quebec’s candidate for the board did not need the rat¬ ification of the convention.
 The three full-time officers, plus two others, would be elected at the con¬ vention. The remaining seven would include those elected as executive offi¬
cers of the Canadian Council (six), plus the elected president of the Quebec
###### Council. This method allowed for a partial integration of the council and
NEB structures but also assured some stability in the case of a radical elec¬
###### toral change in the union. A complete change would have to occur over
two elections at least a year apart (i.e., at the convention and the Council

###### meeting).
 Within the union, the remaining controversy over the split was as much about the process as about the decision. This controversy was especially heated at the crucial and politically divided Oshawa local (Local 222).

To: All Canadian UAW Members

I am taking this opportunity to write to you personally about the recent
important developments within our union.

You have no doubt read or heard that on December 1, the Canadian UAW
Council, made up of 350 UAW leaders elected from local unions across Canada, en¬
dorsed my recommendation that the UAW in Canada seek greater autonomy—or
independence—within the International Union. These delegates approved my recom¬
mendation because they felt strongly, as I did, that the UAW in Canada must have the
freedom to pursue Canadian collective bargaining goals and address the concerns of
Canadian UAW members as effectively as possible.

Accordingly, I attended the meeting of the UAW's International Executive Board
on December 10 with the aim of trying to obtain more independence for Canada within
the international Union. I made what I believe to be the best arguments possible to try
to change the structure of the International to make it more representative of
Canadian workers. After more than four hours of debate at that meeting, my motion
was rejected 24 to !, with myself casting the single dissenting vote.

During the debate, 1 had made my position clear: 1 had been authorized by both
the Canadian and Quebec Councils that if the 1EB was not willing to allow Canada full
autonomy on certain terms, through structural changes, then we should proceed to set
up two separate UAW's: one in Canada ond one in the U.S., ensuring that each would be
financially and structurally sound and have close fraternal ties.

Immediately following the 24 to 1 vote, 1 made a motion to set up two organiza¬
tions. A majority of International Executive Board members voted in favour of that
motion.

We are now in the process of putting together a committee which will include
myself, most likely the President and Secretary-Treasurer of the International Union,
and others. We will try to work out the necessary financial arrangements to make sure
that a separate UAW in Canada is financially sound. We also have lawyers and various
Canadian UAW staff members reviewing oil concerns—-be they constitutional, legal, or
financial—so that this transition is made as smoothly as possible in order that all our
members are fully protected. All these procedures will take time. We will keep your
local union leadership informed as we go along. They, in turn, will be passing the nec¬
essary information on to you.

It is impossible for me to deal with alt the issues coming out of this new develop¬
ment in this letter. However, let me assure you that this is being done in the best
interests of ojj our members in Canada.

What we are doing, really, is restructuring an organization called the
"International Union, UAW," which was joined at the top, where one Canadian sat on a
25-member Executive Board, where our union dues went to Detroit, and where we
received in return, certain benefits, including the sharing of a strike fund. We are
restructuring that into two organizations, where our union dues will al! stay in Canada,
where we will have an elected, Canadian executive board, where we will have a strike
fund to support our members forced on strike in the same way and in the same amount
as we have always done. We expect to retain the same local union structure and dues
structure as we have now.

This does not affect jobs, it is not a declaration of war on the companies we
work for, on the American workers, or on the U.S. leadership of the International
Union. It is taking control of our own decisions, being accountable and responsible,
and not passing the blame on to someone else.

I intend to lead this restructuring. It will be done corefuily and intelligently.
In the end we will have a strong, dynamic, democratic, and financially sound UAW in
Canada.

This really is a natural evolution, a growing up of our union. Believe me, in the
long run, it will be in the best interests of the UAW members in Canada and the Cana¬
dian labour movement. We hope to have some material, with much more detail,
distributed in the plants and offices, as soon as possible.

It is important as we go through this change that we do it together, and not allow
corporations, politicians, or other outside interests to interfere with our direction.

Thank you for your support in the past, and may 1985 be a successful year for
you.

Fraternally yours,

RWsWOac ROBERT WHITE,

International Vice-President

Bob White’s letter to members announcing Canadian Council’s decision to form
Canadian union.

###### authority to make such a decision and that, considering the fundamental nature of the decision, the council should have called for a referendum vote. They were right about the council not having the constitutional blessing to
make the decision, but a referendum in Canada also held no “constitutional
authority.” The central issue was not constitutional authority; it was the
democratic legitimacy of the split in Canada.

###### The option of a referendum was discussed in some depth at the national

office. The reason for its ultimate rejection was that, while adding little, it cre¬
ated substantial risk. There was no question that the members overwhelming¬

ly supported the split. The staff, local activists, and the delegates elected to
council were in regular contact with members and readily confirmed this sup¬
port, as did the meetings and newspapers of the local unions. Even former
UAW president Doug Fraser, who was critical of the Canadians for leaving,
laughed when asked about a referendum vote; according to Fraser, “White
would easily get eighty-five per cent.” The concern about a referendum was

less about letting the members decide — they had made their feelings known
through other forums — than about creating an opening for others outside the

investments. If the Council announced a vote, the companies could have

could certainly release rumours about a
refusal to transfer any monies to the
new union, leaving it without a strike
fund and reinforcing concerns about staff salaries and services. Since the col¬
lective agreements were legally with the parent union, not the Canadian

UAW, it could be argued that once the Canadian office led a breakaway, that
office was no longer the bargaining agent for any of the units in Canada.

 Over the nine months following the council decision, financial and legal matters were settled. The UAW agreed to transfer $36 million to the Canadians; this amount was less than their fair share but it was sufficient to
equip the new union with an adequate strike fund and some cash for admin¬
###### istrative purposes. At the founding convention in early September, 1985, the Canadian UAW formally established the new union, and in the summer of 1986, the union was renamed the Canadian Auto Workers.

 A Culture of Resistance

 The massive disinvestments in auto and the dissolution of the Autopact pre¬ dicted by the experts in the event of a Canadian split didn’t materialize. Yet economic restructuring both within the workplace and through plant clo¬
sures was taking its toll. The new Mulroney government had made it clear
###### — after the election, of course — that it would shift power to the corpora¬ tions by way of a greater reliance on markets and competitiveness. The test of any policy or activity would be whether or not it increased Canada’s com¬

In the mid-eighties, the CAW suffered casualties in terms of plant clo¬

sures, especially in the auto parts sector, and any gains that were made were
generally limited and vulnerable to future changes. But the union continued
to fight back. This stubborn resistance was central to the CAW’s survival
and strength as a social force in the country. One measure of the strength of

Detroit’s valuable services were more than adequately replaced, and rather
###### than having to cope with the loss of financial subsidies from the UAW, the
CAW found itself with additional resources for its own priorities. The split
didn’t drain or divert the CAW; it energized the union.

###### The attitude of the new union was that it could and should participate in
all relevant struggles. It supported other workers on strike, made organizing
###### even more of a priority, invested a sizable portion of its strike fund in mod¬
ernizing and expanding the education centre, assisted locals in developing
###### their own newspapers, introduced innovations in bargaining, and played a vital national role in the crucial debate over free trade and the future of the
country.

###### The first act of the new union involved a group of young women who
had, with the support of the CLC and its affiliates, taken on one of the most
powerful institutions in the country — the Canadian Bank of Commerce.
###### Along with other unions, the Canadian UAW contributed money for strike

pay, and it also provided staff. The minute the formation of the CAW was

ers for a year to protect existing standards in the union and accelerate the
###### recruitment of new workers. The decision was in part related to the opportu- nities created by the wave of media attention surrounding the split. The
CAW had been receiving increasing numbers of calls from groups of workers
###### attracted by both the union’s well-publicized successes and the fact that it
was becoming Canadian (which, to these workers, meant that decisions
were made in Canada, not in a foreign country, and that money collected in
###### Canada stayed in the country).
 The decision regarding education was much more costly and risky. It
involved the rebuilding and expansion of the union’s education centre in
Port Elgin. That expenditure reflected the priority the union placed on edu¬
###### cation and was indicative of the permanence of the CAW. It announced that the union was here to stay and that it was building for the future. This educa¬ tion centre belonged to the workers. At Port Elgin, workers exchanged infor¬ mation about the latest management strategies in the workplace, tried to get

a handle on the deficit, and learned about a history they had previously been
denied — their own. It was a place where they studied the role of workers in
###### the scheme of things. Port Elgin was also the home of the CAW’s unique
Family Education Program. Run in the summer as two weeks of vacation and
###### education for the families of CAW members, the program symbolized the
union’s commitment to integrating the family and union culture. And, as the
###### home of the Canadian Council, Port Elgin was the place where activists
renewed contacts with old friends and later met in crowded rooms to share
rumours and complaints or out-yell each other in debates. Paintings, pho¬
tographs, and posters reflected everyday lives and paid tribute to past strug¬
gles. At Port Elgin, working people were more than “just workers.”

In collective bargaining, the union consolidated its separation from the
U.S. and tried to restore the notion that bargaining was not about corporate
###### demands (concessions) but about workers’ demands (sharing in progress,
improving the workplace). The union lobbied for legislated changes, and
###### when Parliament wavered under corporate pressure, as it did with indexed
pensions and advanced lay-off notice in Ontario, the union confronted it in
bargaining — both to win gains and to demonstrate that the change in leg¬
islation was in fact practical. And with its new control over its finances, the
CAW was able to provide financial support for the struggles of other unions
###### when they came for help: woodworkers on the West Coast, telephone work¬
ers in Newfoundland, food-processing workers in Alberta, public sector

###### The “culture of resistance” that had developed in the union was rooted
in a historical legacy and recent involvement in struggles. The role of edu¬
###### cation was to reinforce and consolidate that culture (“education” also included films, pamphlets, union newspapers, music, and even writing class¬

es that encouraged workers to resist the dominant culture and tell their own
stories). As a culture that permeated the union, it did not depend on or wait
for leadership from “the top.” Local activists and members proved them¬
selves quite capable of leading on their own. The best example of this
###### autonomy was in aerospace, where the local leadership at de Havilland Aircraft and then McDonnell-Douglas took on the issue of health and safety and led the largest collective refusals Canada had ever seen.
 When Mulroney announced his intention to move towards the FTA with the United States in 1986, the CAW was there in opposition with its credi¬ bility and organizational/financial clout. Leadership meetings and forums
were held in every community with a CAW base across the country. Bob
###### White, as leader of the CAW, was generally viewed as a central leader and
spokesperson for the anti-free trade coalition. Over one million pamphlets
were distributed in the plants, to homes, at schools, and in malls. Full-page
ads appeared in newspapers across the country when opposition to the agree¬
###### ment was flagging and in need of revitalization. And CAW activists across the country brought the issue into the plants and worked with others to introduce more Canadians to politics by way of the anti-FTA fight.
 In spite of the subsequent close defeat, the fight against free trade proved the potential of the Canadian labour movement and highlighted its impor¬ tance as a relevant and democratic social force. Without the intervention of the labour movement, the crucial debate over the future direction of the country would have been a brief and hardly noticeable interruption in Canadian life. In the past, the economic and political elite of the country had always been divided on free trade. Now, however, business was united in
its favour; the media, with a few exceptions, endorsed that support; and
###### opposition from the NDP had no fire. Canadian labour, along with its resource-poor but commitment-rich coalition partners, forced a national dis¬
cussion which, at least for a brief moment, had the establishment nervously
making accommodating promises.

###### After the 1988 federal election, Bob White of the CAW and Leo Gerrard of the steelworkers’ union each wrote scathing public criticisms of the NDP’s belated and tepid handling of the free trade issue. The tone of the

The modem health and safety movement emerged in the mid-sixties, when the
workers placed the issue of working conditions on the agenda. From the beginning
and into the nineties, that health and safety movement was influenced by the rising
consciousness of public health and the environment, and by outside activists.

In the early seventies, wildcats by miners in Northern Ontario, members of the
Steelworkers union, forced a Royal Commission on Health and Safety, and the
Saskatchewan NDP government introduced legislation patterned on earlier legislation
in Sweden that was unique to North America. That legislation emphasized both a
greater role for the state in policing health and safety and the empowerment of workers
who could themselves force the issue. That empowerment included the establishment
of health and safety committees, the right to information, protection against reprisal
and above all, the right to refuse work that might endanger workers. The
Saskatchewan legislation became the model for progressive reform on the continent.

In Ontario, worker militancy over the issue surprised trade union leaders. The
NDP made it a central issue, and this forced legislative changes and significant
increases in government budgets dealing with workers’ health. In the mid-eighties,
there was another round of worker pressure and militancy over the issue. In 1987
and 1988, workers at de Havilland and McDonnell-Douglas staged the largest
work refusals that had ever occurred for health and safety, shutting down
production and making major gains in cleaning up the workplace, training and
educating the workforce, and monitoring the health of workers.

good times (old problems persisted and new ones arrived) than with the
###### union remaining a place where it was still possible to fight for, and hang on
to, alternative ideals. The issue the union now faced was whether, in these

###### — CAW 1994 Convention Document


-----

###### The formation of the CAW in the mid-eighties coincided with the election
of Brian Mulroney and the Conservatives into office. The Tory victory sym¬
bolized the capture of the national agenda by big business in a way not seen
since the early years of the depression. The Tories laid the foundation for a
###### revolution which, ten years later, the Liberals cynically brought into full
force. The social programs and gains that were fought for years ago and that
were fundamental to a sense of citizenship in Canada were being diminished
and demolished.

###### Although Canadian governments had focused primarily on fighting inflation since the mid-seventies, inflation continued to rise through the eighties. The government was planning to introduce the Goods and
Services Tax (GST) in the early nineties, but this tax would directly raise
prices, and result in even higher inflation if workers successfully raised their
wages to compensate for the tax hike. At the same time, the freedom of cor¬
porations to relocate plants and invest money had been increased because of
###### both international developments and domestic policy decisions. This com¬ bination of factors reinforced the government’s determination to focus on restraining inflation. Concerned about competitiveness and capital out¬
flows, but reluctant to strengthen controls over investment and finance, the
###### government tightened the screws on the economy even further by way of higher interest rates.
 This move not only destroyed jobs and denied people a chance to partic¬
ipate in productive work — in the name, strangely enough, of strengthening
###### the economy — but it also set the stage for the later debt crisis. Slow growth
and high unemployment resulted in lower government revenues and higher
social costs. The subsequent budgetary deficit would be financed by money
borrowed at higher interest rates. The growing deficit became the basis for
###### another attack on public sector wages and social services. Taxpayers rebelled against further taxation because the unfairness of the tax system wasn’t
addressed and because the added revenue was going to pay interest and
therefore represented no improvement in services. As a consequence, ser¬
vices faced the knife — and the cuts would be deep enough to change the
###### nature of Canadian society.
 During this radical restructuring of the economy, politics, mood, and nature of Canadian society, the CAW was undergoing its own internal transformation.


-----

###### Mergers: Developing a New Membership Base

 In the decade after the split, the CAW’s membership increased by fifty per cent to almost 200,000. In contrast, membership in the UAW over this
same ten-year period fell by one-third. By 1995, the number of UAW mem¬
bers was half of that in 1979, just before concession bargaining began.

###### The increase in the membership of the CAW is, however, misleading: it
doesn’t accurately reflect the union’s experiences. It hides the losses and
###### pain of the closures and downsizing that occurred, and it understates the even larger increases in the number of new members. As a result of the accelerated restructuring of the economy, plant closures had become com¬ mon even in so-called good times. The deep recession at the end of the
eighties and into the early nineties was, however, particularly destructive.
###### Between 1985 and 1995, CAW members suffered through 250 closures, which affected about 28,000 workers.
 In addition, thousands of jobs were lost through the everyday growth in productivity because of new tech¬ nology, because companies were

###### These losses would have cut the union’s size by over one-third to under

loss. Workers clearly wanted to join unions, and the CAW’s economic
###### restructuring had also included new plants and therefore potential members. The added resources invested in organizing resulted in the recruitment of almost 450 units representing about 43,000 new members in this ten-year period (50,000 if the government-imposed vote amongst a number of rail

originally exceeded 100,000, but some of these groups, especially those con¬

 The mergers were rooted in the history and structure of the labour move¬ ment in Canada. In the private sector, the trade union movement had gener¬
ally grown up as a branch plant of the American movement. As unions broke

away to form their own Canadian structures, they found that they were too
small to survive on their own. A union structure and diversity that might
have worked in the larger economy of the U.S. was impractical and too frag¬
###### mented in Canada. The corporate aggressiveness and the tough economic
times highlighted this weakness. Many unions, including some that still
belonged to American international unions, therefore welcomed admission

wide mergers had a strong logic,
yet other factors turned out to be
more significant: union histories,
###### ideology, attitudes to interna¬ tional unions, government-mandated reductions in the number of unions, and bureaucratic concerns over staff and leadership positions.
 Past conflicts over raids, competition over bargaining strategies, and
failed attempts to cooperate left a bitter legacy between certain unions who
seemed to be logical partners. A unit that had just broken away from an
###### international union to become Canadian would not merge with another international. Even Canadian sections of internationals that- wanted to merge their Canadian operations would generally be blocked until the Americans approved the merger. Ideological compatibility turned out to be an important factor not just because of the legacy of labour’s own cold war, but because the trade union movement was in fact in the midst of a debate about alternative directions Some unions were on the same wavelength in

###### occurred in 1994. The Canadian Brotherhood of Railway Transport and General Workers (CBRT), which began as an industrial union in the
rail industry three decades before industrial unionism made its breakthrough
in manufacturing, merged with the CAW. When the Canadian UAW was
first being organized in the thirties, the CBRT (then the CBRE) ranked as
###### one of the largest unions in the country. It also preceded the CAW in becoming a general union across the country, having moved from represent¬
ing only railworkers to also speaking for workers in hotels and hospitals,
###### truck drivers, garage mechanics, ferry workers, and workers on the Great
Lakes. The CBRT’s rail members, along with the CAW’s earlier merger with

ended, as past rounds normally did, with back-to-work legislation, the union
nevertheless showed that the mergers did create the possibility of develop¬
ing new and more effective strategies. In bringing together seven of the rail
unions, the CAW acted as a catalyst to replace much of the past distrust and
tensions with collective confidence and discipline. Unity was possible.

###### Furthermore, sections of railworkers had, almost a decade ago, argued
against the traditional strategy of a shut-down, which usually accomplished

###### nothing more than bring¬ ing in the government.

###### The streamlining of the economy, just like the streamlining of auto pro¬ duction, clearly left the companies extremely vulnerable to creative tactics. The issue that remained was to convince the rail unions outside the CAW that, from a unified base, such strategies were worthwhile.
 Other large mergers brought in groups with a left-nationalist ideology.
Some, such as the United Electrical Workers and Mine Mill, which had been
expelled from the CLC during labour’s cold war but survived, continued to
play a significant role on their own. UE was eventually accepted back in;
Mine Mill was not. Others had been part of a separate labour central, the

Mergers with airline groups and the broadly diversified CBRT raised the
###### total number of women in the union to over 40,000. This reinforced the demand for leadership schools for women, and strengthened the base for more
effective women’s networks across the country. The rail mergers almost dou¬
bled the number of skilled trades in the union to over 35,000, strengthening
###### their potential lobbying effectiveness nationally and provincially. The merger with the Canadian Textile and Chemical Union led to the innovative estab¬ lishment of a storefront office in downtown Toronto, allowing the union to
work with, and build ties to, the neighbouring immigrant communities.

###### The most controversial of the mergers involved the Fishermen, Food, and Allied Workers (FFAW) of Newfoundland. The FFAW was “more than just a union.” It was a powerful presence in Newfoundland’s communities

 White and the CAW leader¬ ship understood the possible implications of allowing the Newfoundland
workers to join the union: a bitter and costly fight with the UFCW, attacks
from the international unions that saw this move as opening the door for
###### other groups considering going Canadian, and the financial costs of taking on a union with low dues and high costs. From the perspective of direct
gains for the CAW, the merger offered little. Nevertheless, the NEB and the
###### union voted in favour of merging. Workers were not the property of any union. If committed unionists and determined workers wanted to join a dif¬ ferent organization, and they could not realistically do so because there was no way to express and carry out a democratic decision, then the CAW had a
responsibility to support them.

###### The legal and organizational battles with the UFCW cost the CAW a
very substantial sum of money. The merger shook up the labour movement
###### and seemed to put the issue of workers’ democratic rights inside their unions on the agenda. However, the lack of consensus within labour assured that
this issue of internal union democracy was never satisfactorily resolved.

###### From Non-American to Canadian

 With their breakaway, the Canadians were no longer part of an American union. It was not the split, however, that made the union truly Canadian. It
was the mergers, which nationalized the union by involving all regions of
###### the country and no longer limiting unionization to central Canada. The
mergers transformed the union into a microcosm of the entire Canadian
economy, not just of the heavy manufacturing sector.

###### The CAW was now building cars, planes, trains, buses, subway cars, and


-----

###### the ground, refining aluminum, and pulling fish out of the sea. Members of the CAW were shipping resources by rail and truck, transporting people by
plane, truck, and bus. They were manufacturing telecommunications equip¬
###### ment and servicing the equipment to facilitate national and international communication. They worked in hotels and casinos, served food in restau¬
rants, and cared for patients in nursing homes.

###### The crucial change wasn’t just the diversification of the union into a
number of sectors and regions, but its central role in so many parts of the
economy across the country. The CAW had become the largest union in a
wide range of manufacturing sectors, the dominant union in transportation
services and the fisheries, and an increasingly important union in mining
and the hospitality sector.

In 1984, ninety per cent of the CAW membership was contained in a
few centres in southern Ontario and in the Montreal area. Those Ontario
###### centres were Windsor, St. Catharines, London-Woodstock, Chatham, Cambridge-Kitchener-Brantford, and the Toronto-Oshawa-Oakville-
Brampton area. With the mergers, the CAW became the largest private sec¬
###### tor union not just in Ontario, but also in Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, New
Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island, and had a major presence in Quebec,
British Columbia, Alberta, and Manitoba.

###### Although the mergers certainly added new and difficult challenges, they
were also a source of strength and vitality. The mergers brought unions with
###### their own rich histories, activists with talent and experience, and the energy
of new members. In addition, they encouraged the development of a broader
working class consciousness on the part of the past and future CAW mem¬
bers. CAW activists, having heard a report on the fisheries at the council,
read the newspaper differently and paid more attention to what was happen¬
ing to working people in Newfoundland. Students in the PEL program, lis¬
###### tening to a passenger agent explain the impact of lean production on her
work, realized that work reorganization was in fact part of something bigger
and that service workers were really workers.

Particularly important was the contribution of the mergers to the momen¬
tum of the union. A union characterized by growth is more likely to feel con¬
###### fident about the possibilities of moving ahead. The 1993 Big Three negotia¬
tions were an example of the influence of that general mood on a union. The
###### union entered that round of bargaining at a time when the labour movement

###### and administrative advantages. Its members were generally concen¬ trated in a narrow region of the country, in a few highly unionized indus¬ tries, in larger plants, with full-time positions, and with relatively high
wages. This concentration in itself provided the national union with a
strong revenue base and relatively low operating costs.

###### Union policy reinforced these strengths by negotiating, wherever possi¬
ble, full-time elected company-paid reps in the larger units, and by encour¬
aging smaller units to amalgamate into larger locals. The union’s commit¬
###### ment to leadership training supported the development of this local activist
base of stewards and full-time officials. Locals in Canada were large, even
relative to the United States: in the mid-eighties, the average CAW local
###### had about fifty per cent more members than the average UAW local.
 That local structure strengthened the democracy, effectiveness, and
finances of the union. The existence of strong and independent locals rein¬
forced the accountability of the national office. It also meant that council
and executive board discussions and debates weren’t just abstract posturing
###### but reflected a serious local mandate. If locals weren’t in favour, decisions


-----

###### The ability of the locals to manage their own affairs meant that a qualified
pool of potential staff and leaders was more readily developed, and that the

were also relatively higher paid),
###### and the need for a smaller staff. The overall financial structure built on this base was sound.

By the eighties, however, the economic restructuring had begun to
###### undermine some of these advantages. There was a rash of plant closings. Plants were moved to rural areas and new plants were set up in non-union
areas. And as a matter of corporate policy, the new plants that replaced old
###### plants were generally smaller. As a result, organizing was both more essential and more expensive. Furthermore, the ongoing cost of serving new, inexpe¬ rienced, and often smaller units was high while their dues — given the pres¬
sure to keep wages low in this period and the difficulty in raising them
quickly to a standard pay level — were relatively low. And although the
###### union had always spent substantial amounts on broader political activities, the increasing importance of nonbargaining issues like free trade in the lives of its members led to increasing expenditures on political campaigns.
 In each of the five years ending in 1991, the union reported a deficit in
its general funds. This period included high expenses for organizing and the
costly merger with the FFAW, but the majority of mergers actually came
later. (Two-thirds of the workers who joined the CAW by way of mergers
came after 1991.) The total deficit over the period exceeded $27 million.
###### The subsequent mergers added to these cost pressures, since it became more expensive to serve a membership base that was increasingly spread across the country and in a wide range of sectors.
 The safety valve for the union in this period was the strength of its strike
fund. That fund was structured to subsidize an eight-week strike at its largest
###### unit, GM. But the changes in GM’s operations had left such a standard irrel¬ evant; only a complete war with GM could lead to that long a strike, and in
such a war the size of the strike fund would not be decisive The union was


-----

therefore able to draw on the strike fund to cover its deficits over this peri¬

od, without running out of monies for strike pay.

Nevertheless, depleting the strike fund was not a long-term solution. The
###### union leadership at the Big Three was justifiably anxious that the strike
fund not be drained. The existence of a large strike fund was still important
to the membership and as a message to the companies. The CAW leadership
therefore tested the council on an increase in the dues structure, from the
###### current two hours per month to 2.5 hours per month. The mood was not
receptive. The economy was in a tailspin, and workers’ wages were stagnant.
More significant, resistance was building against new taxation (the GST
###### had just been introduced), and an increase in the dues check-off sounded
uncomfortably like a new tax.

Between the council meeting and the 1991 convention, the union distrib¬
uted more information on the changing times and the needs of the union, and
lobbied activists. At the convention, members overwhelmingly approved an
increase of twenty minutes (rather than the original half hour) in the dues
stmcture. Although there was some nervousness about a backlash in the work¬
place once this increase hit the paycheques, none occurred. Explanatory pam¬
phlets were distributed to all the locals, and the local leadership explained the
necessity of the increase. The change in dues was soon old news.

###### The new dues structure allowed the union to move closer towards bal¬ ancing its budget. But the initial costs of bringing in other new groups of
workers, full-scale unions in their own right, were high. There were adjust¬
###### ment costs in dealing with their staff, nationwide educational campaigns to explain the structures and processes of the union, and the internal politics and subsequent delay in moving small units towards amalgamation into
more viable locals. In offsetting these costs, the union could not impose
###### another dues increase. The solution lay in more careful and systematic man¬ agement of the operations of the increasingly complex union.
 This issue of management was, however, not just a financial question: it
raised difficult questions about the structure and nature of the union: To
###### what extent can a union decentralize to allow for local initiative and pro¬
vide services, while resisting regionalism and the loss of a coherent national
direction? How can a union maintain the strength to respond to its powerful
enemies, but also allow for the membership input and control that is even
more fundamental to mobilizing for struggles? How can the organization

 Militant Loyalty

 The most important internal issue the CAW faced, and which encompassed the management issue, was recreating the magnetic force that brought and kept the union together; the CAW had to create what Walter Reuther long
ago called militant loyalty to the union and its cause. Amongst the chal¬
lenges and potential problems of this issue were changes in the composition
of the workforce, the relationship to the rest of the labour movement, and
###### the crisis in left politics.
 Within major auto companies, the limited expansions over this period had aged the workforce. In the mid-seventies, the average Big Three worker
was in his or her early thirties; by the end of the eighties this worker was
###### approaching the mid-forties. This aging was particularly evident amongst

Over and above the mergers, economic restructuring was reducing the traditional white-male base of the union, while new hires and newly orga-


-----

nized units added greater numbers of women, recent immigrants, and people
of colour. This diversification demanded increased sensitivity to ensure that
###### the union truly represented all members and their needs. Developing leader¬
ship from these groups was especially crucial. This was not just as a matter of
equal opportunity, but a matter of ensuring that the daily life of all CAW
activists includes interaction with members from all parts of the union. And
###### the union would benefit from developing and using all the potential and tal¬ ent that existed in the workforce.
 The union addressed these issues in bargaining, in educationals, through
films, and in its structures. Though difficult, the issues seemed manageable.
###### A growing constituency was demanding changes and the leadership was committed to responding. The union had to decide how fast changes could
be made, whether the resources applied were reasonable or needed to be
increased, and what the best approach might be. Harder to manage, and
###### therefore more dangerous, was the possibility of the union being over¬ whelmed by changes outside the union. Such changes had infected and
weakened other unions and other labour movements.

Just as new circumstances and the issue of direction had caused the split
from the international UAW, similar debates about direction now caused
tensions within the Canadian labour movement. The isolation of the CAW
amongst the private sector unions was primarily caused by the threat the
CAW’s successes posed to the existence of international unionism in
###### Canada. But it was also related to the nature of unionism, as some unions
began to accept the need for a less adversarial approach.

###### The CAW certainly made compromises; it didn’t have the power to avoid them. As long as American society remained on the right, the achievements of Canada and Canadian labour would remain limited. In the
midst of the euphoria after the split from the Americans, Phil Bennett, the
###### head of the GM Master Bargaining Committee and a strong supporter of the
breakaway, asked the sobering question: “How long can we continue to go
in a different direction than the Americans?”

###### The Canadians had put this nagging question aside to form the CAW. They couldn’t ignore it, but neither could they wait for American labour to revive itself. They could only continue their own struggle, insisting that unions remain independent working class organizations and arguing that, with corporations more aggressive than ever before, the last thing unions
should adopt is the illusion of false partnerships. From 1975 to 1988, the

###### confronted with a steady series of chal¬

lenges to traditional unionism and saying “NO!” was an effective solution:
###### NO to wage controls in the mid-seventies; NO to concessions at the end of the seventies; NO to the opening of agreements in the early eighties; NO to the new direction of the American leadership; and NO to free trade with the United States. Such a response was not easy. It took courage because it
resulted in difficult changes to long-standing structures and attitudes within
###### the union. But it provided the union and workers with a ready response, if not complete answers.
 The union was also much more homogeneous at that time. In recent
years, it has become more diversified, and it is still in the process of accom¬
###### modating the internal changes. Moreover, the Canadian labour movement
itself was more unified in the earlier period. There was still a general con¬
sensus within labour that concession bargaining and false partnerships dam¬
aged, rather than helped, working people. The fights of the autoworkers
were the fights of the labour movement, even if there were tensions over
###### jurisdiction and over which unions were the informal leaders of the Canadian labour movement.

Before, the union had positioned itself as the underdog challenging
###### American multinationals and the American UAW to protect past gains and Canadian sovereignty. Now, as globalization seemed to push nationalism
aside, and with the CAW being the largest private sector union in the coun¬

try, that nationalist underdog role had ebbed.

ties, members of the corporate and political elite were beginning their
###### attempt to change people’s economic and social expectations, and people
resisted. But over time, those expectations did change. The strategy of out¬
right refusal, effective for a period of time, was becoming increasingly diffi¬
cult to sustain. Some unions acceded to “the end of adversarialism,” prompt¬
ing the media to challenge the CAW on why it too wasn’t changing.

###### The change in the national mood inevitably also affected many CAW
members. Many workers, tired of banging their heads against corporate/gov-
###### ernment walls gave up on social change and turned inward. (“I’ll work over¬
time to make up for the tuition increases for my kids”; “reduce my taxes, and

I’ll take care of my own pensions.”) Some exhausted activists found their
confidence wavering and cynicism invading their thoughts. When hope fal¬
ters, the pressures of daily life increase the incidence of burn-out, and a par¬
alyzing demoralization threatens to take over. After swimming so long
against the tide, the swimmer gets tired.

###### All of this seemed to be directly related to the union experiencing, in
1994, its first staff strike. Regardless of the immediate events, personalities,
and bargaining issues that led to the strike, the changes in the organization
and in society were having an impact on the staff’s view of itself. The move
to independence had been accompanied by the formation of an elected
executive board, and that necessarily shifted some of the effective power in
###### the union away from the staff and towards the board. The sheer size and
complexity of the organization limited past informal contacts; the staff had,
for example, doubled since the split. In addition, some staff were starting to
suffer from the same let-down that other activists faced: exhaustion from
years of struggles over increasingly limited gains; the perception that every¬
###### thing — their life, their work, their assumptions — had become more com¬
plicated; an uncomfortable uncertainty about where the labour movement
###### and their own union were heading; and a questioning of whether things
would or could get better.

###### The election of the Ontario NDP in September, 1990, seemed to be the tonic that the labour movement so desperately needed. The significance of the NDP victory — over and above the fact that it had never before hap¬ pened in the province — was that Ontario is the industrial heartland of Canada, with an economy equal in size to those of major countries such as
Sweden. Starting the nineties with a victory symbolized a rejection of the
###### corporate agenda that had dominated the eighties. For workers, it meant


-----

###### institutions of the state, they might actually have some friends in high
places to support their struggles and needs.

###### The Crisis in Social Democracy

Soon, however, many workers were wondering which groups in society had
won the election and which had lost. Long-standing promises such as public
###### auto insurance were not only postponed but discarded and discredited. The
deficit in Ontario was a problem that couldn’t be wished away, but rather
###### than changing how deficits, and therefore politics, were discussed in Canada, the NDP began, as journalist Tom Walkom put it, “talking Tory.” The NDP used the deficit to pressure its allies into line, rather than to clari¬

fy and expose the underlying democratic questions: Why do financial insti¬
###### tutions have so much power? How can we democratize economic power so that bankers are not determining social policy? If the crisis is so dangerous,
why aren’t we discussing the responsibility of the rich in contributing to
solutions?

As part of its deficit response, the NDP introduced the cynically mis¬
###### named “social contract,” which took away the most fundamental union right — the right to bargain — from public sector workers. That single poli¬
cy reinforced the denigration of public sector workers, legitimized future
###### attacks on unions, added to divisions within labour, and effectively severed the NDP’s ties with its most important potential base.
 Some workers rejected the NDP for the “wrong” reasons. The NDP’s introduction of some long-sought progressive changes like employment
equity no doubt resulted in a backlash amongst many working people. But
###### that backlash was rooted in the fact that these issues were not placed in the broader context of working class struggles. The party’s overall language and direction did not clearly identify it as fighting on behalf of working people. And its backtracking had disarmed the party’s past supporters in the work¬
places; they no longer played a role in explaining the purpose of positive
###### changes and defending the party against unfair criticism. Even amongst those who would still vote for the party given the lack of choices, most
would do so without the enthusiasm that is so critical to the success of par¬
ties who don’t have the luxury of big money behind them.

###### The gains the NDP government had made — and it had taken a number


-----

###### resentation, and the barriers facing women and visible minorities in the
labour market — were undermined. In other provinces, NDP governments
###### appeared to be more durable, but only where the absence of a centrist
Liberal party allowed the NDP itself to fill that role.

As the NDP developed its strategy, one perspective that it lacked was the
“old” socialist idea of a party that defined its role as moulding the working
class into an effective political force. That perspective emphasized develop¬
ing the understanding of working people and building vehicles for collective
###### intervention in all aspects of their lives. It aimed at overcoming fragmenta¬ tion of the working class by encouraging their collective confidence in
building a better world. But at this crucial time in history, with the right
vulnerable in terms of its inability to deliver and with working people des¬
perate for leadership, social democracy had no answers, and the NDP wore
###### that failure. The tragic impact of the Ontario NDP government’s reign was,
unfortunately, to further destroy hope and to demoralize, divide, and ulti¬
mately demobilize rather than activate working people.

###### That the NDP had limited answers was not simply an Ontarian or Canadian matter; it was part of a more general, international crisis in social
democracy. As corporate power increased, social democratic parties followed
###### the swing to the right, hoping that moderation might increase their chances
of election. However, even if the socialist ideal of a planned and democratic
###### economy was forgotten, and even if social democrats simply wanted to maintain the welfare state that capitalism itself had earlier accepted, such
goals could no longer be maintained in a nonradical way. Globalization and
###### international finance would undermine even modest goals if the power of capital was not addressed. As John Crotty summarized it in an essay in
Creating a New World Economy:

###### The bottom line is this: Capital mobility gives the wealthy
classes around the globe veto power over the economic poli¬
cies and priorities of every nation. No progressive, democra¬
tically controlled system of economic regulation can func¬
###### tion effectively if it does not break that veto power through the imposition of capital controls.

 Although some CAW activists did work for the NDP in the 1995 Ontario election and although, as individuals, many decided they had no

could not endorse the party’s role in government by endorsing them in the
election. The CAW would, of course, participate in the process to revive the
NDP, but it was clear that the immediate support and solutions the union
needed would not come from the party.

###### The union would have to draw on its own strengths. It would have to
reach into the historical legacy and culture of struggle that had led working
people to build the UAW and then the CAW. It would have to rely on: the
###### momentum from the split and the new legacies the merged sections brought
to the union; the conscious leadership decision to keep expectations high
and demands aggressive; and the structures that provided forums for ongoing
###### collective discussions and development of responses. Those structures included the Canadian and Quebec Councils, the strong locals and the
locally rooted executive board, the extended education and training for
activists, and a tightly knit staff.

he mergers truly transformed the CAW. For every person who was a
###### T
member a short ten years ago when the union was formed, there were
two current members who didn’t directly experience the split. The number
of members outside of auto had tripled. Members who worked in auto plants
used to outnumber others by almost three to one; now, they were a minority,
###### though they still comprised by far the largest and most influential single
group in the CAW. Previously, less than ten per cent of the union members
were outside of Ontario; now, well over one-third came from outside that
###### province. Of the original twelve-person executive board elected after the
split (including the union’s top three full-time officers) none remained.

###### When the union celebrated its tenth year, it was therefore remarkably different from the organization that nervously left the UAW. While the union looked for quiet periods to deal with its internal changes, dangerous external changes were accelerating. The mid- to late eighties, the period just
after the formation of the CAW, when Canadian labour led the challenge to
corporate Canada’s FTA, once seemed like the peak of labour’s mobilization.
But events since then warned of the steep decline on the other side of that
###### perilous peak. The union would, in confronting these most threatening
times, have to creatively rethink what a new unionism, which preserved the
basic insights of the old, might look like.

As the CAW approached the end of its first decade as an independent
###### union, it faced the most threatening period since its birth as part of the
UAW in the thirties. The steady increase in corporate power had intensified
pressures on workers in the workplace and, by way of governments, disman-
tied progress made over more than half a century. Now the establishment

was beckoning workers and unions to accept that there was no alternative
and that it was time to give up.

###### The reality of the “no alternative” argument is, however, that workers have no alternative but to resist and fight. Acceptance of the right-wing arguments simply invites further demands to give up more. Acceptance
would also mean that workers’ organizations would quickly wither. The
choice, as American socialist Eugene Debs once said, is agitation or stagna¬
tion. It’s this latter concern, of letting the union stagnate and therefore los¬
ing it as a vehicle for resistance and change, that is the most threatening. As
a consequence, the trade union issue of the times is to consider struggles
from the perspective of their impact on building both the union and the
capacity of workers for future struggles. Building is everything.

###### Building Blocks

In the spring of 1994, the CAW established a task force to determine the
state of the membership and to obtain its input into the direction of the
###### union. The results were presented to the fall constitutional convention,
along with a discussion paper which asked if the union was “just getting big¬
ger and more diverse” or whether there was “a logic to where [it was] head¬
ing — a logic that could be built on.”

###### Interest in the task force was extremely high. People appreciated the
executive board coming into their communities to listen, and they did not
###### hesitate to make strong criticisms or put forth ideas. Criticisms generally had a positive spirit (“this is my union, I’m proud of it, but some things need changing”). An overriding issue, in the task force meetings and at union
gatherings, was that the mergers and diversification seemed to be moving
###### the union away from the traditional model of industrial unionism. Was this direction good or bad? Did this shift happen by design or accident? Should it
be halted, accelerated, or modified?

 development of appropriate structures, policies, directions, and ideas required experimentation, widespread input, and involvement from all lev¬
els of the union as it struggled for change. That difficult process of rediscov¬
ery constitutes no less than working people “making history.”

As the CAW addressed its future, the following issues were critical.

###### Back to the Workplace

 When industrial unionism first emerged, its base was in the workplace. The union would be built in the workplace, and it would live or die there. Once unionism was established, companies paid to retain their authority at the point of production. The companies consented (under pressure, of course) to
wage and benefit increases in exchange for limiting workers’ access to man¬
###### agement rights. But increased international competition and squeezed profit
margins pushed the companies to regain even the limited rights they had ear¬
lier surrendered. With unions weakened by high unemployment and job inse¬

subtle threat of denying new investment
and taking away jobs was always there.
###### The CAW’s response was not to reject
all workplace changes but to reject the notion of partnership and the false
###### equality it implied. Workplace change required negotiation between two
groups — management and labour — that had some overlapping interests
###### but also clear conflicts. The first priority of the union was therefore to put forth an independent workers’ agenda on workplace change to provide the
focus for mobilization and bargaining, and it was essential that this agenda
was backed up with adequate resources.

In 1993, the union created a department for work organization, a struc¬
ture unique amongst unions on this continent. The department produced
###### educational programs, pamphlets, and films on the nature of the changes the
companies were introducing, and possible worker responses. It developed a
cadre of rank-and-file trainers who could lead local discussions and educa¬
###### tional. In addition, the department conducted research on the impact of the

emerged stronger for it.

###### Time to Control Our Time

 The organization of work includes control over the organization of time. In
its early days, the union created its base workplace by workplace. However,
###### control over work-time was the issue that historically united workers across those workplaces and was therefore so crucial to making it into a movement.
 Although current work-time concerns range from part-time workers demanding more time to other workers wanting more flexible schedules to
deal with family responsibilities, the primary issue in the earlier days of the
###### labour movement was how much of the workday — and therefore their lives — the workers surrendered to the bosses. Twelve-hour days left little time
for relaxation and family or little energy for workers to develop themselves
by reading and learning or to engage in politics. For this reason, Karl Marx
###### supported the ten-hour day as a crucial reform in the mid-1800s. May Day, celebrated internationally as labour’s day (though only in isolated communi¬

century for reduced work-time. And the nine-hour movement in Canada,
led by the skilled trades, was a historic period in the development of the
###### Canadian working class because of its role in uniting workers across commu¬
nities and regions.

###### When the UAW was formed, the dream of reduced work-time was suffi¬
ciently important to be included in its first constitution. In the first agree¬
ments, negotiated lay-off procedures included, as a measure of solidarity, the
sharing of existing work before lay-offs occurred. At GM, there was even a
ban on overtime if any probationary workers were still on lay-off. The war
brought steady overtime, but once the war was winding down, the Canadian
UAW lobbied for standardizing the forty-hour week and ending overtime in
order to create job openings for returning veterans. By itself, this solidarity
###### with unemployed workers implied a significant decrease in take-home pay at

a time when prices were expected to rise rapidly. The union’s solution was to
mobilize workers for a major wage offensive to make up for the controls on
wages during the war.

In the postwar period, autoworkers made major gains in holidays and
###### vacation time. But overtime returned. From the late fifties through the sev¬ enties, there were repeated wildcats over compulsory overtime. The Canadian UAW lobbied for at least voluntary overtime (“Ask me. Don’t tell
me”), and the union unsuccessfully extended the long 1970 GM strike sim¬
ply to fight for what workers allegedly won in the forties and fifties: the right
to work no longer than forty hours per week.

By the eighties, however, the growing economic insecurity and the
###### increased level of dependence on overtime income virtually eliminated overtime as a rank-and-file issue in the Big Three auto plants. Even the in- plant representatives, historically the leaders in fighting compulsory over¬
time, were neutralized — in part because many reps were themselves depen¬
###### dent on overtime pay. The Big Three contracts stipulated that, as long as
even a few workers in any department worked overtime and therefore need¬
ed representation, their rep received credit for overtime. Many stewards
were therefore getting credit for at least twice the amount of overtime of an
average worker.

###### At the same time, the companies favoured overtime because it gave them
more flexibility and because it allowed them to hire fewer workers and there¬
fore save on benefit costs. As governments cut back on social programs such

as unemployment insurance and coverage for health and drug plans, the

A calculation made by CAW research concluded that if each hour of
overtime worked had to be offset by an hour of time off, and if legislated
standards provided each worker with the right to one paid week of educa-
###### tion/training, roughly half of a million full-time job openings would be cre¬ ated. Whether or not the actual number is lower, the potential for job opportunities through the redistribution of work-time is great.

In the 1993 bargaining round, with Chrysler considering a third shift in
###### the Windsor mini-van plant and wanting to switch to ten-hour days to implement it, the union insisted that workers share in the benefits of the
greater utilization of equipment through jobs and more paid time off. The
###### outcome was a breakthrough in the eight-hour day; the new schedules
would include eight hours pay for 7.5 hours of work. Although overtime
would still occur on weekends, the new schedules implied some decrease in
overtime. This decrease raised resistance, especially from the skilled trades.
But to its credit, the local leadership went ahead with the change, and
###### though some criticism persists, it is now generally accepted. The new shift, the shorter day, and an additional compulsory vacation week created 1,300
new job openings in the Windsor community. At Ford, the negotiating com¬
###### mittee added the principle of all vacation time being compulsory. Some
workers had become accustomed to working through their vacations and
therefore doubling their pay for those periods.

In spite of such moves, popular support for fighting overtime in the auto
majors does not presently exist. The first step may be to fight for voluntary
overtime, which the companies will fiercely resist, given the need for a min¬

 From Sectoral Bargaining to Jobs

 Industrial unionism was based on the workplace, but its bargaining strategy focused on a sectoral approach. The emphasis was on preventing workers in one workplace from competing with and undercutting workers in another. Such sectorwide bargaining over wages and benefits remains a crucial under¬ pinning of union strategy, but workers are becoming increasingly concerned not only with the price of their labour but with job security.
 The problem is that unions can’t directly provide jobs. (One important exception is the ability of unions to create job openings through the reduc¬ tion of each individual’s work-time.) Moreover, a focus on job creation usu¬ ally gets translated into the need to strengthen the companies so they will retain or expand jobs. This strategy is often only a stone’s throw away from weakening the workers and introducing concession bargaining.
 At its 1994 convention, the CAW responded to this strategy by arguing that any overall job strategy would have to be sectoral rather than company based. And it suggested the policy question: what institutions and regula¬ tions will ensure that Canada strengthens its productive capacity in a partic¬ ular sector? For example, in auto assembly, the union fought for strengthen¬ ing content legislation; in aerospace, the union argued that the government should use its purchasing power as a buyer of planes or its direct ownership to guarantee an integrated industry; and in rail, the essential factor was a national transportation policy. In other sectors, the focus might be coordi¬ nated training: in auto parts, an industrywide training program is underway. In certain communities, the key might be research centres grouping selected firms to develop products that would replace imports while keeping the expertise in the community. Or it might be conversion centres that shift the equipment and skills in facilities that are or will be closed to providing prod¬ ucts and services crucial to environmental concerns: the Brampton area CAW locals have been leading the fight to build a “Green Work” alliance to mobilize such initiatives.
 Since none of these strategies could be introduced solely by the union —

 Diversification: A Union Not a Federation

Diversification has been crucial not only to avoid the decline of the union,
###### but also to growth. Diversification also brought to the union the relative sta¬
bility of support from more than one sector, and the energy and momentum
of the new sectors. A potential problem arose as to whether, in the spirit of
solidarity, the CAW was diversifying without focus, overextending its capac¬
ities, and merging with units to which it had little to offer. The union held
###### internal debates over this issue, and while it reached no consensus, it
seemed to be heading towards a balanced resolution.

###### The more fundamental issue focused on whether the union’s goal of

various unions operating in their Courtesy of the CAW Collection.
###### own sectors with little control, cohesion, or solidarity. The last thing the CAW wanted was to
become such a federation.

###### Industrial unionism had emphasized bringing all workers in a sector under one umbrella and isolating one company to win an industry pattern.
As the CAW diversified, it tried to spread that basic orientation to key sec¬
tors outside of industry such as the private service sector. The key to pre¬
###### venting the union from becoming a federation of relatively autonomous sec¬ tions was affirming the collective bargaining role of the union’s central
office. The union’s strong service departments — especially the pension and
###### benefits department — played a vital role in this regard. But the union couldn’t retain that focus without the involvement of the political leader¬ ship of the union. This reinforced the president’s direct involvement in
major negotiating rounds.

###### This heavy dependence on the president was not, however, sustainable


-----

###### heavy and complex. Others in top leadership positions would have to
develop the confidence and authority to take over more of those duties.
Furthermore, while the national office’s bargaining role would establish its
authority, developing a strong sense of unity throughout the organization
would have to include broader steps, such as building a common overall
ideology and greater interaction at the base between formerly different
groups.

To some extent, the need to develop a common ideology was alleviated

by the fact that the diversification in the union wasn’t random; in general,
###### the groups that joined the CAW came because they understood and sup- ported CAW positions, and its direction. Nevertheless, the CAW was itself
searching for an effective ideology for the times.

###### The issue of the base was addressed by emphasizing the need to keep
moving smaller units into amalgamated locals in each community. This flow
would assemble diverse groups within one structure, giving each group
###### greater collective capacity. Amalgamation would also create and develop
workers’ common experiences in spite of the range of their different sectors
and histories. Units in a particular local who shared interests with units in
###### other communities could cooperate through national councils — as GM
workers, for example, now do.

###### With such strategies, the hazard of over-diversifying could be overcome.
Diversification could therefore strengthen the union and spread, rather than
###### undermine, the basic strengths of industrial unionism.

 From Social Unionism to Movement Unionism

 The UAW (and then the CAW) always rejected business unionism — a
unionism that limited itself to the price its members got for their labour. In
###### contrast, the union espoused social unionism — a unionism that considered
workers as more than just sellers of labour, that was sensitive to broader con¬
cerns, and that contributed to those in need in the community and interna¬
tionally. This philosophy was reflected in a wide range of activities at the
local level that ranged from sports and music camps for kids to shelters for
###### battered women, health clinics, and child care established for union mem¬
bers but open to the general public. A particularly ambitious and successful
###### program involved the development of co-op housing, which started in

###### A more powerful version of social unionism, which could more appropri¬
ately be called movement unionism, existed in the early days of the union.
###### The distinction is not one of degree or commitment but of orientation. In the early days, when workers were struggling to form their organization, the
community wasn’t so much the needy recipient of union support as it was a
necessary resource for the union in surviving and winning broader battles.
###### The union needed the community. And the union’s activities extended
beyond a particular progressive position; they were directed at mobilizing
and building. That mobilization was, in the minds of many activists, more
###### than a matter of achieving certain reforms; it included the hope of more
profound change in the nature of society with the workers themselves play¬
ing the leading role. “Talkin’ union” was then also “talkin’ movement.”

###### The threats to social influence facing today’s unions can only be over¬
come by drawing on that earlier experience of movement unionism, when
workers surmounted even greater odds to build the union. Learning from
###### that experience would mean, as Panitch and Swartz write, “opening the way
for unions to become, as far as possible, centres of working class life and cul¬
ture.” It means making the union into a vehicle through which its members
###### can not only address their bargaining demands but actively lead the fight for
everything that affects working people in their communities and the coun¬

try. Movement unionism includes the shape of bargaining demands, the
scope of union activities, the approach to issues of change, and above all,
###### that sense of commitment to a larger movement that might suffer defeats, but can’t be destroyed.
 The union has only recently begun discussing the issue in these terms, but concrete initiatives have emerged at various levels. In bargaining, the
emphasis on reduced work-time was directly linked to creating job openings
for others in the community. The union has been exploring the establish¬
###### ment of local committees, which could include spouses and teenagers, to
address the experiences of working class kids in the school system. In April,
1995, a CAW conference in Windsor for young people interested in the
###### environment led to the students’ establishment of local environmental com-
mittes in their schools. In addition, over 5,000 students have completed the

PEL program; these graduates have a background in movement unionism
###### and offer immense potential for activism as the union expands its local
activities.

Most recently, in response to the February, 1995, Liberal budget, which

formed, lay in the excitement it created as a movement (linked, not by acci¬

society as a whole. Imagine,
###### for example, the limited debate there would have been over the crucial issues of free trade and cutbacks in social services without the oppositional base of unions.
 The goals of unions are rooted in democracy. But those goals aren’t achievable unless the internal life of the union is itself democratic enough
to mobilize its only resource: the will and collective actions of its members.
###### Unions are voluntary organizations. Workers vote to join a union, and the
ability of the trade union leadership to force workers to follow the line is
limited. That leadership can’t fire or discipline workers; on the contrary, it
needs their consent and active support. So while leadership is always impor¬
###### tant, it draws its strength from workers’ feeling that the union is truly theirs: that is, that the union reflects and fights for their needs.

In good times, this active involvement of the members might seem less
obvious. Workers might view their union as an insurance agent to whom
###### they pay a premium in exchange for certain benefits. A comfortable union bureaucracy could make deals with companies that apathetic workers accept. But good times are never permanent and in bad times, when the corporations tear up old deals, a union with such a limited vision of itself
would be incapable of mounting an effective response.

###### healthy strike fund, the executive board voted to divert a portion of future strike fund contributions to a unionwide educational program on human rights. That program would start with the education of local leadership,
stewards, and other activists.

###### The regional nature of Canada, and now the union, has added another dimension to the issue of equal access. Sensitivity to regional concerns is fundamental, yet the union doesn’t want to risk regional fragmentation. For
example, at 600 delegates, the Canadian Council was becoming so diverse
###### and large that some leaders suggested breaking it up into regional councils.
But this idea was overwhelmingly rejected by delegates both within and out¬
###### side Ontario. Delegates reaffirmed the importance of maintaining the Canadian Council and keeping it in Port Elgin. They supported the expan¬ sion of the education centre in Port Elgin so it could accommodate the expanded council, continuing transportation subsidies to representatives
from distant locals, and supplementing the council with other structures and
measures, (the expansion in Port Elgin has, however, been postponed until
###### the union’s financial situation improves).
 The supplementary steps included establishing regional conferences (e.g., there is now an annual western regional conference); decentralizing certain educational programs (e.g., basic courses such as Workers’ Compensation
Benefits (WCB), which depend on provincial legislation); and extending
###### the sectoral councils. In most cases, the sectoral councils actually united the union around nationwide, as opposed to regional, concerns (e.g., the aero¬
space council brings together workers from Halifax, Montreal, Toronto, and
###### Winnipeg). In other cases, the structure of the union and the nature of the membership meant that the new councils were essentially regional (e.g., the

###### While equality of access to participation is a principle and a goal, the
degree of actual participation in the union varies widely. Only a relatively
small minority of workers can be called activists; i.e., workers involved in
###### the daily decisions and administration of the union. This dependence on a relatively small cadre was true even in the early days of the union. The
expansion of union democracy necessitates increasing the number of such
###### activists, developing their commitment and capabilities, and reinforcing their role as essentially “organizers of the organized” — that is, as building the membership and introducing more workers to union life.
 The strengthening of the activist base and the expansion of the number

 Participation of Former Members

The union has also tried to extend the principle of participation to include
laid-off members and retirees. The success in keeping permanently laid-off
members involved has been very limited and isolated to a few locals (e.g.,
McDonnell-Douglas). The link to the union’s retirees has been much more
successful.

One reason for the success with retirees is that, in major agreements, the
union continues to negotiate pension improvements over and above
indexing (some unions bargain special lump sum improvements but very
few negotiate additions to the basic pension benefit). The second element
of the successful mobilizing of retirees is that they remain structurally
linked to the union by way of their participation in elections for local
officers and convention delegates (they cannot, however, vote for in-plant
representations or on tentative agreements). The retirees are therefore an
important political force in some locals. Furthermore, the national office of
the union provides them with staff assistance in organizing themselves into
effective local chapters with their own dues provisions.

These retirees now number close to 25,000. Given their experience,
organizing skills, time, and access to some resources, the retirees have made
an important contribution to community and national campaigns around
issues such as medicare and public pensions, and individual retirees have
also moved into leadership positions of other national organizations of
retirees. Since the peak hiring in auto was in the mid- to late sixties, the
ranks of the retirees will grow significantly over the next decade,
increasing their potential role.

and, above all, by maintaining the union’s constant involvement in cam¬

For the CAW in the nineties, additional activists were coming from the

###### Democracy and Consensus

Some union decisions are made through direct democracy, such as a vote
to strike and the ratification or rejection of a collective agreement. Many
others are delegated to elected representatives. At CAW constitutional
conventions, the highest decision-making body of the union, decisions are
formally made by the votes of the delegates. But controversial votes at this
level (and at the bargaining convention) have been rare because of the
attempt to establish some consensus on potentially divisive issues before
the convention.

This only works, in democratic terms, because of the depth of other
union structures that can debate the issues on the way to a consensus.
Controversial issues can, for example, be raised — without resolution but
only to get a sense of where people are — at regular meetings of the
Canadian Council or through regional and sectoral conferences. In
addition, preparatory meetings are held before the convention to discuss
policy papers and resolutions and the local delegates and staff brought in
for such meetings are chosen to ensure representation from all sections of
the union. (Such meetings now include some eighty people of which about
one-third are staff.)

Though the number of speakers from the floor is high at the convention
and criticism is not unusual, conventions have involved less of a fight over
policy and direction than an endorsement of those preconvention
decisions, and a cultural event. As a cultural event, the convention
celebrates the struggles and achievements of the union, establishes
contacts, builds unity, and motivates participants to continue the fight.

Democracy is not supplied by a constitution. Nor can it be reduced to a
mechanism for keeping leaders in line (as relevant as that need is). Union
democracy is primarily about workers making changes: changing
themselves, changing their immediate world, and laying the basis for
eventually changing the larger world. Union democracy is built by workers
in their struggles to build the union, which acts as their line of defence and
base for progress. Democracy is therefore not separate from struggles, nor is
it static; it must constantly be redefined, recreated, and reinvented.

therefore be sufficiently centralized to balance the centralized power of the
###### other side, yet decentralized enough to permit local initiative and mobiliza¬ tion. The risk is that centralization will reach an overwhelming level and


-----

In the earlier years of the union, the existence of an organized left was
###### one check on over-centralization. It brought particular activists together around specific issues and demands and challenged the top leadership of the union. This raised the level of debate throughout the union and often pushed the CAW in more militant directions. The left-right conflict at times degenerated into destructive factional fights; however, at least in Canada, the survival of that left opposition into the seventies strengthened the union. Its absence places an even greater responsibility on the activists
in the union and on the role of the union’s democratic structures.

###### From the Past to the Future: It Depends

 During the twenties, when unions were floundering and corporate power and social inequality were growing — a time with some parallels to today —
few would have predicted the explosion of industrial unionism. When the
depression first hit and unemployment climbed, the prospects for a union
###### breakthrough seemed to slip even further. Yet the persistence of the few and the growing anger of the many lead to a movement of protest and reform, out of which industrial unionism grew and spread its roots.
 The UAW emerged in the United States during the “worst of times.” Its
spread to Canada wasn’t based on formal or institutional internationalism,
###### but on the powerful

ile until the relative shortage of labour during the war and the stability and
prosperity of the postwar years provided a chance for working people to con¬

solidate and make steady material gains.

Ironically, the “best of times” included the seeds of the problems that
would eventually undermine the American union. The weakening of the
locals and the destruction of the left opposition removed both safeguards


-----

against union bureaucratization and a source of future dynamism. In the six¬
ties, the resulting American union couldn’t tap into the energy of the new
movements. By the end of the seventies, the American UAW had lost the
confidence and spirit to fight concessions.

###### The Canadians were “the same but different.” They faced a different eco¬ nomic and political context as they moved hesitantly towards the American
model, and they didn’t get to the full basics of that model until the end of
###### the fifties. By then the sixties were near and, unlike the Americans, the Canadians had retained a legacy that could be rejuvenated to become a part
of the social rebellion. When the corporations demanded concessions in the
late seventies and into the eighties, the Canadian UAW resisted.

###### The differences that had emerged between the American and Canadian
UAW were rooted in a combination of factors: economically, in the delayed
growth of Canada’s manufacturing base; politically, in the later development
in Canada of supportive labour legislation and the consequent longer strug¬
gle for union recognition; internally, in the persistence of a strong left based
in strong locals; structurally, in the uniqueness of the Canadian Council;
###### and culturally, in the differing role of nationalism in the two countries. American nationalism was the nationalism of the dominant power in the
world, and it tended to tie the union to establishment goals. Canadian
###### nationalism, particularly in the later years, was a response to that American domination. It was an expression of opposition to American-based compa¬
nies and a rejection of the American vision of the good life.

###### In the early seventies, the capitalist economies adopted a radical shift in direction, particularly in North America. The postwar period of steady
growth was over, and a transition began towards lowering the expectations
###### of workers while strengthening the flexibility and power of corporations. The conflict over the best response to the new situation faced by workers,
particularly in bargaining, led to the split of the Canadian union from its
###### parent organization. The split was not easy. Like other national institutions, the Canadian section had long been dependent on the Americans for lead¬
ership and support. But the move to independence was tied to a new confi¬
###### dence and maturity; once the Canadians were on their own, they soared. Although the economic and political environment was increasingly hostile and many of the fights were defensive, the CAW experienced the most exciting and exhilarating period in its history.

Yet that culture of resistance could not, without other changes, continue


-----

###### that attacked established social programs, friendly governments that caused bitter disappointments, and divisions between unions searching for new directions took their toll. Mergers with other unions and an impressive
degree of organizing gave the CAW some much-needed momentum, but by
###### the early nineties, the crisis that was demoralizing and affecting the left internationally was also highlighting the vulnerability of the CAW.
 The split that had given birth to the CAW, and unified the membership and leadership around building the new union, was also the source of new divisions within Canadian labour. The example and profile of the CAW challenged the direction of other private sector unions, and left many of their leaders uncomfortable. Bob White had, even before the split, raised the issue of uniting autoworkers, steelworkers, electrical workers into a Canadian Metalworkers Federation. But the timing was wrong: relationships
were to grow worse, and besides, other Canadian unions would have to wait
for their American parents to act first.

These divisions over the role of unions in the context of the new corporate
aggressiveness also played themselves out in the relationship with the NDP. It
was hardly surprising that, having severed its historical ties with its own union
###### over the issue of concessions, the CAW would have trouble living with a
social democratic government that used the power of the state to break collec¬
tive agreements and enforce concessions on public sector workers.

###### These divisions were not just external. The issue of the relationship with the NDP also created internal tensions; relations between some of the staff and the national office remained somewhat strained after the staff strike; and
more open disagreements surfaced within the union over social issues such as
###### employment equity and gun control. But the one issue around which the union remained united, and which continued to be the key to building the union, was the issue that created the CAW in 1985: the determination to
resist concessions and to maintain the independence of the union as a voice
###### and structure through which to defend working people.

Like other unions, today’s CAW faces the most threatening attacks in its
history. The Canadian labour movement has maintained itself better than
most movements around the world, but as the status of the American labour
###### movement and especially of the UAW reveals, there is no basis for assuming the continued success of even the strongest unions. And for the CAW, as President Buzz Hargrove has emphasized, the issue is not only whether the union can survive, but also whether it can continue to play a crucial leader¬
ship role within Canadian labour and Canadian society

###### STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES

WORKING PEOPLE NEED UNIONS

We formed our union because we could not depend on employers to provide us with dignity,
a measure of security, and a rising standard of living. And, over the years, we did make impressive
gains. But our objectives remain far from fulfilled, and, with even our past gains under attack,
WE NEED UNIONS TODAY AS MUCH AS WE EVER DID.

DEMOCRATIC UNIONISM
Unions are voluntary organizations. We can only be effective if the membership knows the
union truly belongs to them. This means a union which reflects the goals of its membership, allows
the members full participation, and encourages workers to develop their own skills and
understanding.

Internal democracy also means we view each other as EQUALS. Racial discrimination or
sexual harassment violate our principles, undermine our solidarity and erode our strength. We not
only oppose such responses but will actively work to overcome them.

UNIONS AND A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY
In our society, private corporations control the workplace and set the framework for all
employees. By way ofthis economic power, they influence the laws, policies, and ideas of society.
Unions are central to our society being democratic because:

Unions bring a measure ofdemocracy to the place of work,
which is so central to people's lives.

Llnions act as a partial counterweight to corporate power and
the corporate agenda in society more generally.

SOCIAL UNIONISM
Our collective bargaining strength is based on our internal organization and mobilization,
but it is also influenced by the more general climate around us: laws, policies, the economy1, and social
attitudes. Furthermore, our lives extend beyond collective bargaining and the workplace and we must
concern ourselves with issues like housing, taxation, education, medical services, the environment,
the international economy.

Social unionism means unionism which is rooted in the workplace bur understands the
IMPORTANCE OF PARTICIPATING IN, AND INFLUENCING, THE GENERAL DIRECTION
OF SOCIETY

BUILDING TOMORROW
Unions were born out ofstruggles to change the status quo. Our successes extended
progress beyond unions themselves, and our struggles became part of a SOCIAL MOVEMENT for
a more humane society here and for peace and justice internationally. These struggles were first steps
towards developing the confidence that change is possible and that our vision of society is

NOI'JUSTADREAM.

We are proud of the leadership role we have played, aware of the
difficulties continued progressive change will face, and committed

to building the social solidarity that can take on this challenge.

###### At the same time, the CAW is on the verge of a generational change. The UAW emerged out of a generation living through the Great Depression and the war. In the sixties, a new generation flooded the auto plants and
produced today’s leadership and activists in the traditional CAW sectors. It
must now prepare to pass the union on to the next generation — one that
has not experienced postwar prosperity but instead grew up in an age of per¬
###### manent insecurity that weakened the will to protest and the drive to reform.

We can hope that members of the next generation will simply say “We
###### won t take it anymore ; that they are fed up with an economic system that produces so much more with so much less, yet constantly degrades their
lives. We can hope that they will look around at the growing polarization of
###### wealth and power, and at the international financiers that now determine the availability of jobs and what we can and cannot do, and ask: “What happened to democracy?” We can hope that they will reject the continual demand that Canadians must be more productive when their own skills and the skills of their friends are unused and unwanted. And we can hope that
this generation demands “a common sense that makes sense.”

But that next generation, like our generation, will rely on what the pre¬
vious generation built and left, what it has passed on. That previous genera¬
###### tion, in this case, is us; the issue becomes what we will now leave behind.
 he labour movement and the CAW today face one of those historical T moments when the only answer to questions about the future is: “It depends.” People and their organizations make their own history. They
don’t, of course, make history without constraints, nor do they make it from
###### scratch. The CAW confronts this challenge with an impressive cadre of
activists, staff, and leadership. It is rich with opportunities for participation
###### and equipped to accommodate the ongoing development of the union. It
has a legacy going back to the thirties that was renewed with great excite¬
###### ment a short decade ago when the CAW was born. That legacy tells the inspiring story of working people’s efforts to constantly stretch the limits they faced, expand their options, learn from defeats, and build on successes.
 In the nineties, the challenge is to translate all the uncertainties into a
wide-ranging debate in the CAW to develop the self-confidence that asks
###### not if the union can do it, but how. And the development of that confi¬ dence will rest, above all, on the commitment of activists, staff, and leader¬ ship at all levels to take the individual and collective responsibility for building the capacities and leading the struggles that will shape the future

sis on their unions and is particularly thorough on skilled workers in the last
###### half of the 1800s. Jamieson’s short book seems to focus on the institutions of
bargaining and legislation but is in fact much richer. The Panitch-Swartz book
analyzes the specific conditions that led to past gains for Canadian labour and
###### the limits of those gains as conditions changed. It is especially strong in its
analysis and discussion of labour’s relationship to the state and the NDP.

Mike Davis, Prisoners of the American Dream: Politics and Economy in the

History of the US Working Class (London: Verso, 1986)

Moody’s book attempts to shed light on how the American labour move'
###### ment declined into business unionism — a question certainly relevant to the Canadian labour movement in its present vulnerable phase. Davis also
addresses the failure of American labour and the left to put forth an altema-
tive politics. His book is more theoretical and though brilliant, is a relative¬

ly difficult read for those less familiar with left debates.

Yates’ book addresses the interaction of internal conflicts and external poli-
itcs that shaped the Canadian autoworkers in the postwar period. In fact, it
ranges far beyond the union’s definition of politics and political mobiliza¬
###### tion, and is an important contribution to the history of the CAW. Sugiman’s
book is a history of women workers within the Canadian autoworkers. It
tries to come to grips with the contradictions and dilemmas faced by women
###### fighting for equality within a progressive, but male-dominated, union.
White’s book is the personal and inside account of the life of a leader who

was so central to the union, with a special focus on the period leading to the
###### formation of the CAW. The history of Quebec places workers’ struggles and

Goldfield’s article describes the radical social climate in the early thirties,

inside account of the UAW and the family that played such a prominent
###### role in its development. Unfortunately it was written in 1976, before Reuther broke with the UAW adminstration, so it does not include that
story. There have been dozens of biographies of Walter Reuther, but the
###### forthcoming one by Lichtenstein, who has done some of the most interest¬
ing research on the role of the UAW in the workplace, should be especially
###### interesting.

 THE BIRTH AND TRANSFORMATION OF A UNION

The Canadian Auto Workers union, the CAW, has a long and rich history. Part of the U.S.-
###### based United Auto Workers for almost fifty years, the CAW separated from its American parent in 1985. Today, the Canadian Auto Workers union encompasses members from a broad range of industries. It is also one of the most powerful unions in the country. Yet
few people know the union's history, how it acquired its strength, or what accounts for its
split with its American parent.

This illustrated history provides a fascinating look at the union from its origins to the pre¬
###### sent. Beginning in the twenties, Sam Gindin describes the early years of the automobile industry and the emergence of GM, Ford, and Chrysler. He looks at the birth of the UAW

in 1936, the conflicts that rocked the union in the fifties, the signing of the Autopact in
###### the sixties, and the historic split of the Canadian section from the UAW two decades later.

Finally, he considers the issues facing the union and the Canadian labour movement as
###### the century draws to a close.

By providing a profile of the CAW as well as the labour and social movements that it
###### helped shape, The Canadian Auto Workers offers us something unusual — an engross¬
ing glimpse of our past, written from a union perspective.

SAM GINDIN is a labour economist, a leading authority on the auto industry, and a con¬
###### tributor to many labour-based publications. He is the assistant to the president of the CAW.
