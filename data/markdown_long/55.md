##### ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

This book is the culmination of much of my academic and intellectual
endeavour over the last ten years or so. Because of this I have been
able to incorporate a fair amount of previous research into my
analysis of Scottish work, society and culture over the last two hun-
dred years. As such, many individuals and institutions have played a
large part in facilitating the writing of this volume. Financial support
and intellectual assistance has been forthcoming on a generous level.
However, since these sources have already been thanked for all they
have done for me, I hope I can be forgiven if on this occasion I only
thank those individuals who have materially and intellectually
supported the writing of the current volume.

Of course, any researcher needs the support of efficient and help-
ful archivists and librarians. Thankfully, in Scotland there are a large
number of institutions in which these qualities are to be found in
large measure. The staff of the Scottish Record Office, the National
Library of Scotland, the Mitchell Library, and, not least, the
University of St Andrews' Library have helped me in so many ways
that it would be impossible to list them all. All I can say is thank
you for making research such an enjoyable and rewarding experience.
In this vein I would also like to thank Glasgow University Archive
and Business Records Centre, Scottish Life Archive, University of St
Andrews Library, and Ian MacDougall for their kind permission to
reproduce photographs from their collections.
I have also benefited from discussions with colleagues and students
concerning the contentious intellectual issues that the book attempts
to grapple with. In particular, Alan McKinlay has acted as a sounding
board and, at times, a mentor for my theories and speculations. All
I can say is thanks for your patience and advice Alan. I also have
to thank him for allowing me access to unpublished work and for
providing me with research material. In this connection I would

also like to thank Chris Whatley for reading and commenting on the
first chapter. His erudition and knowledge of eighteenth- and early
nineteenth-century Scottish history proved invaluable. Chris, of course,
bears no responsibility for any mistakes and misunderstandings on
my part. The same can be said of Hamish Fraser, who not only
refereed the typescript, but also made some very valuable comments
on the text and introduced me to sources which have been of great
help in the process of redrafting the book. Finally, my thanks go to
the commissioning editor of Edinburgh University Press, John Davey,
who was a delight to work with and provided all the encouragement
and support an author could need.
To end on a personal note I want to express my thanks to my wife,
Patty, and my children, David, Kim, Liam and Natasha for their
unflagging support, their occasional criticisms, and their love. They
make the whole endeavour worthwhile.

##### INTRODUCTION

This book is about Scottish workers: their culture, their working
lives, and their politics. Twenty-five years ago such an enterprise,
whether viewed from a methodological or ideological standpoint,
would have been relatively unproblematical. Marxist categories of
analysis dominated theoretical discourses in the arts and social sci-
ences and class was seen by all, with the exception of those on the
right of the political spectrum, as the key to unravelling the processes
of transformation in society; indeed, class struggle was viewed as the
motor of change in history. A quarter of a century later, writing a
book about the working class of any country calls for a very different
set of academic considerations and as an historical exercise appears
to need some form of intellectual justification. New challenges posed
by the growth of feminism, nationalism and a resurgent right-wing
historiography have forced historians, particularly on the left, to
confront the philosophical certainties of the post-war decades. The
great isms and truths of philosophical systems, of social analyses, of
historical and cultural studies have come under greater critical scru-
tiny, and in the process have been rejected by newer generations of
academics as less than useful in understanding past and present
developments in society. We now live, it is argued, in a world of post-
modernist rationality, in which everything is relative and identities
and values compete with each other in an incoherent and indeterminate
hierarchy of significance.
Whereas in the past historical and political analysis rested on the
rock of class division, of a social landscape divided into owners and
non-owners of capital, post-modernist philosophy views human
behaviour as deeply complex, diverse and fragmented, and, as a result,
impossible to explain by recourse to a reductionist, all-encompassing
theory of human affairs based on social class. [1 ] Human beings, their
behaviour and values, are seen by post-modernists as the product of
a multiplicity of influences. Thus, we are not simply workers or

INTRODUCTION

bosses, but members of churches, of football clubs, of ethnic, nation-
al and racial groups. We are men and women, young and old, urban
and rural dwellers, Highlanders and Lowlanders, fashionable and
unfashionable, carnivores and vegetarians. In essence, there is not
one variable that assumes primacy in shaping social and political
behaviour but many. Everything is in flux and explanations of actions
and events highlight the uniqueness of factors and circumstances. In
this mode of analysis, religion or gender might be seen as more
important than social class as a nodal point around which solidarities
might be grouped. Class, then, has been dethroned as historians look
elsewhere for explanatory categories in order to understand the
processes of social and political change.
Politically, the turn away from class and the modes of analyses
connected with it coincided with the collapse of the Berlin Wall and
the Soviet state in the 1980s and the early 1990s; and, in Britain, with
the election of the Thatcher government in 1979, and the inability of
the Labour Party to break the Conservative stranglehold on political
power in the 1980s and for most of the 1990s. The self-confidence
of the Labour movement so brilliantly captured in Francis Williams's
whiggish interpretation of its history- The Magnificent _Journey-_
was shattered. Eric Hobsbawm, and others on the left, began to write
and talk of the 'forward march of Labour halted'. [2 ] The pessimism
was fuelled by the fact that millions of trade unionists had deserted
Labour and voted for the Tories in the 1983 general election. The
defeat of the miners in the following years only added to the gloom.
It was from this political nadir that 'New Labour' emerged, committed
to the politics of consumption rather than production.
The underlying analysis pointed to changes in the occupational
structure of the country. The process of de-industrialisation saw the
collapse of working-class communities, of old style collective values,
and community institutions such as social clubs and co-operative
societies. The 'new' working class was to be found in the service
sector. Its values were far more instrumental and materialistic than
the old working class. As a result, the 'new' working class was more
interested in tax cuts than in a fairer distribution of wealth, or in
defending collective provision through the welfare state. The growth
of owner occupation, as mortgages became more easily available and
tax relief on them more generous, encouraged workers and their
families to join the property-owning democracy so beloved of the
ex-Tory prime minister, Harold MacMillan. Increasingly the division
in society was between those who were part of the private property

system and those who were not, that is, the unemployed, the poor, and
other elements of the so-called underclass. [3 ]In the light of these changes
in the social structure of Britain, the taken-for-granted working-class
Labour voting bloc simply evaporated.
The shift in theory also exploded myths of working-class commu-
nity and solidarity. Workers were seen as less than the salt-of-the-earth
types with socialist leanings portrayed by writers from the inter-war
period such as D. H. Lawrence, George Orwell and J. B. Priestley,
through to post-1945 commentators and novelists such as Richard
Hoggart, Alan Sillitoe, and historians like E. P. Thompson.[4 ] In con-
trast to this 'idealised' portrait, workers were shown as nationalistic,
patriotic, racist, misogynist, materialistic and privatised. [5 ] If they
were not, then how could a third of the working class traditionally
vote Tory, and how could appeals in the 1980s and beyond by the
Conservatives to patriotism and self-interest command so much
support from workers and their families? It was obvious that a reap-
praisal of the role of class in shaping identity and political behaviour
was necessary if we were to account for the phenomenal success of
the Tories and their values in winning over even long-standing trade
unionists.
Historians have been to the fore in this process of reassessment
regarding the impact of social class on human attitudes and behaviour.
The various critiques, notably by Craig Calhoun, of E. P. Thompson's
_The Making of the English Working Class_ (1963), [6 ] and Hobsbawm's
theory of the labour aristocracy[7 ]could rightly be viewed as the start-
ing point in the recent process of dethroning class as the foundation
of historical analysis. But more recently the debate has focussed on
Harry Braverman's _Labour_ _and_ _Monopoly Capital_ (LMC) (1974),
which initiated a whole series of investigations and theoretical specu-
lations regarding the relationship between work and politics. The
polemics of that debate brought to the fore revisionist historians such
as Patrick Joyce, Charles More, Alastair Reid and Jonathan Zeitlin.
Although with no formal or institutional attachment, as a group they
mustered a powerful and compelling critique of Braverman's thesis
concerning deskilling, and, by direct implication, the whole Marxist
idea of class conflict as the motor-force of societal change. [8 ]
In this introduction these intellectual critiques of Marxism and
the role of social class as an explanatory concept in history will be
critically discussed before examining the extent to which they have
influenced historical writing on these issues in Scotland. Additionally,
the extent to which the experience of workers in Scotland fits the

national scenarios constructed by the revisionists will also be con-
sidered. By doing this we will be in a better position to decide how
far the revisionist critique is peculiarly anglocentric, and, conversely,
how far it provides the basis for a genuinely British history of
workers and their families in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
However, before embarking on this task, the theoretical background
to these debates has to be filled in.

1. Marxism and the Capitalist Labour Process

It was the student and worker unrest in France and Italy in the late
1960s and early 1970s which stimulated social scientists to re-inves-
tigate the relationship of the workplace to politics. [9 ] The workplace
had been the site of resistance to Gaullism and Christian Social
Democracy in these years, and because of this it appeared to offer
important clues as to the process of how the more narrowly econo-
mistic struggles of the shop floor interacted with the wider world of
politics. Furthermore, the student/worker revolts of this period also
demonstrated the continuing revolutionary potential of the prole-
tariat, something which contradicted those consensus commentators
in the 1960s who had spoken about the end of ideology. [10 ] Marx, as
so often in these decades, provided the starting point for analysis
with his pathbreaking study of the capitalist labour process.
By the labour process Marx meant the way humans interact with
nature to produce things to meet their needs. In a primitive society
based on common ownership such endeavour, outside of its organisa-
tion, is relatively unproblematic since what is produced is consumed
by the producers and their kin and friends. However, in a capitalist
society it is not enough that what is produced can be consumed, or
is socially useful; the capitalist has to be able to exchange it for a
price greater in value than the cost incurred in its production. As
labour is seen by Marx as the source of value, the capitalist must
ensure that the worker creates a superior value than he or she gets
back in the form of wages. Production in a capitalist society is
therefore bound up with exploitation, or, as Marx would put it, the
creation of surplus value. The process by which surplus value was
extracted from the workers was termed by Marx as valorisation. [11 ]
As valorisation becomes the rationale for production then the labour
process becomes inextricably linked to the struggle for profitable
production. To ensure the continuous flow of profit the capitalist
must not only provide the materials for labour to work on; he or she

4


-----

_Introduction_

must also acquire control of the conditions under which the speed,
skill and dexterity of the worker operates. Once that is realised the
goal of capital becomes the subordination of labour. In the process
of subordination science and technology are used to break down
complex skills into routine operations performed by unskilled labour.
In this way capital and its agents in the system of production gain
control of the labour process and effectively destroy any resistance
coalesced around skill. Deskilled labour becomes homogenised and
easily exploited and manipulated as recalcitrant workers are dismissed
and replaced by more passive ones without significantly disrupting
production.
Braverman adopted Marx's work on the labour process and
enriched it by drawing on theories of scientific management, such as
those propounded by Frederick W. Taylor in _The Principles_ _of_
_Scientific Management_ (1914). [12 ] By doing so Braverman was able
to take a fresh look at questions surrounding skill, technology and
work organisation, particularly in the period of monopoly capitalism.
From his research two main conclusions were drawn regarding the
labour process: firstly, crucial to understanding its development in a
capitalist society is the desire to cheapen the cost of production by
substituting unskilled for skilled labour; and secondly, and more
important, is the desire to guarantee effective employer control of
the labour process by, as Tony Elger puts it, 'dissolving those esoteric
skills which underpinned effective craft control and reorganising
production in the hands of capital and its agents'. [13 ] However, the
homogenisation of labour which results from deskilling was a double-
edged sword for the capitalist class. It may have cheapened production
costs and increased the level of exploitation, but it also created the
potential for a unified working-class response to the pressures of
capitalist society, since all the divisions resulting from gradations of
skill were obliterated. Capitalism in its relentless pursuit of profit by
implication was creating its own gravediggers.
The relationship of work to political change was made very clear
in Braverman's account. However, in spite of its clarity and elegance,
his thesis on deskilling was attacked by all sides of the political spec-
trum. His thesis concerning the development of work in industrial
society was seen as simplistic and one-sided, relying too heavily on
scientific managerialists, such as Taylor. Left-orientated historians
and sociologists criticised Braverman for failing to understand the role
of class struggle in resisting changes in the organisation of produc-
tion.14 Feminist historians also exposed his lack of appreciation of

5

the role gender played in shaping the structure of industrial relations
and the occupational hierarchy in the workplace. [15 ] However, for our
purposes, the most damning critique came from the previously
mentioned revisionist historians associated with 'New Labour', and
those influenced by the neo-liberal economic theories emanating from
the right-wing of British politics.

2. The New Revisionism and the Labour Process

Drawing on an important article by Raphael Samuel on the uneven
development of nineteenth-century industrial capitalism, [16 ] the revi-
sionists argued that there was no linear trend towards deskilling as
the nature of work patterns remained disjointed and haphazard.
Far from being deskilled many workers were able to retain a large
measure of control over the work process. The labour intensive meth-
ods favoured by employers, and the highly differentiated product
markets they operated within, ensured that skill remained at a pre-
mium throughout the nineteenth century. Consequently, the scope
employers had to deskill was limited, and because of this, instead of
acting to destroy skills, employers actually went out of their way to
nurture them. In what could be interpreted as a re-articulation of
nineteenth-century views on the mutuality of capital and labour,
Patrick Joyce argued that the Victorian workplace was a terrain of
compromise rather than conflict with 'capital often ced[ing] to labour
the control [over the labour process]' Y

This view is underscored by Charles More's work on apprenticeship.
He claims that employers and employees co-operated to 'encourage
skill' development. Apprenticeship survived and skill was maintained
because it was economically rational on both the part of the employer
and the apprentice. The former saw that it was in his interest to
ensure that the lad was well-taught in order that he could benefit
from skilled apprentice labour at low wages; while the latter had a
desire to learn a skill which would give him secure earnings and
regular employment at the end of his apprenticeship. [18 ] As part of the
emphasis on the skilled nature of work, More rejected the idea of skill
as a social construct and the role of trade unions in determining skill. [19 ]
Although the twentieth century has seen major changes in the
nature of technology and the organisation of the workplace, revi-
sionists have maintained that the tendency has not been towards the
destruction of skill, but towards its recomposition. Some skills have,
of course, completely disappeared, increasingly so with the onset of

6

_Introduction_

computerised techniques in industry. Riveting in the shipbuilding
industry gave way to welding; muscle power in clockwork gave way
to automatic methods of cargo handling and containerisation; and so
on. However, the disappearance of older competencies has made way
for the emergence of new skills. In 1963, the Technical and Salaried
Staffs Association listed seven categories of technical worker, includ-
ing draughtsmen, designers, estimators, planning engineers and others.
Ten years later the list had grown to 486, of which 400 were of a
technical nature and the rest clerical or supervisory. [20 ] These changes
in the division of labour in engineering was further proof against any
tendency within capitalism towards the degradation of labour as
the numbers of workers with technical expertise in the industry was
increasing rather than diminishing. The new technologies also
encouraged greater flexibility in the distribution of tasks. This
increased the sense of relative autonomy in making decisions, which
reduced the level of alienation, and allowed workers increased
freedom within a production regime which was more challenging
and interesting than routine. [21 ]
Taken as a whole the revisionist critique amounts to a complete
rejection of Braverman's theory of deskilling and, as a consequence,
a denial of the Marxist concept of class struggle as the determinant
of power and authority in the sphere of production. By shifting the
focus of the historian's concerns away from the terrain of class
conflict to the terrain of compromise industrial relations could be
depicted as a search for a mutually reciprocal agreed set of rules and
codes of conduct, rather than a struggle over the distribution of the
social product. Patrick Joyce's notion of 'reciprocity' became a key
term in the new social histories of the workplace. By stressing the
mutuality of capital and labour over issues of common concern, revi-
sionist history did not lose sight of the fact that conflict was still
embedded in workplace relationships; however, it was seen as less to
do with abstract notions of power and authority, and more with
instrumental issues of pay and conditions of work. Contrary to
Braverman, far from being a radicalising agent the workplace was
depicted in these accounts as disabling radical initiatives by continuing
to promote material and status divisions among workers. Alastair
Reid sums up the views of the revisionists when he writes that in the
period 1850-1914:

Most working men and women ... retained real skills and real
autonomy at work, experienced a rising trend in real incomes,

and were increasingly able to sustain their own independent
economic, social and political organisations. As a result the
inevitability of fierce conflict between capital and labour was
considerably reduced and there were many areas where agree-
ment was possible even over the organisation of work itsel£.[22 ]

The links between work and politics seem in this scenario to be
tenuous, and, contrary to Braverman, there is no clear and unam-
biguous trajectory of deskilling in the workplace.

3. Rethinking Des killing and Politics

The revisionist view that skill was preserved and nurtured within the
changing economic and technological regimes of nineteenth- and
twentieth-century capitalism can be contested. Although this will be
dealt with in greater detail in the succeeding chapters of the book, a
few basic points have to be made in order to establish the theoretical
currency of class as a basis of analysis in the sphere of production.
Firstly, there is the evidence of testimony. All the histories of work in
the nineteenth century point to a widespread restructuring of skill
and a tightening up of industrial discipline. And while these changes
were experienced unevenly, few trades were left untouched. As
autobiographies of working men show, the cumulative effect of these
changes was to create a sense of bewilderment and loss among skilled
workers. [23 ] Secondly, even if one could argue that some of these
changes involved an element of re-skilling, to suddenly find that
one's skills, which were developed over a long period of time, were
no longer required must have been a profoundly disturbing experi-
ence for those affected by technological change. Whether this acted
to radicalise workers, or, indeed, provides us with clues in which to
theorise the relationship in general terms between work and politics
is problematic. While it is empirically impossible to verify the rela-
tionship between the two worlds, it might be possible to establish a
number indirect and broad connections.
In spite of the general reduction in working hours that took place
in the nineteenth and early twentieth century, people still spent a
considerable part of their daily lives in the workplace. Average hours
of work for a skilled man were about fifty-four a week in 1900, but
with overtime it might be much longer. Railway engine drivers and
guards spent around seventy hours a week at work. The inner life of
the workplace and the relationships built around it deeply embedded

themselves in the consciousness of the worker. Moreover, since it was
work and the status it conferred on a worker which provided him or
her and family with a place in the wider society of working-class
communities the importance was multiplied in complex ways. The
removal of the foundation of that status and the income that under-
pinned it through changes in the work process involved a loss of face
for those involved. A recent example of this can be found in the
destruction of mining communities in Britain through changing
world markets for coal. This has been accompanied by the demise of
the miner as the symbolic hero figure of the proletariat. The fear of
sinking into poverty was enough to drive displaced workers, and
those threatened by displacement, to seek a modicum of protection
from the state either in the form of a reduced working week, or a
minimum wage. The pursuit of social security inevitably involved
them in political struggles.
Furthermore, as changing work regimes impact themselves on
wages and status, workers are normally moved in the direction of
trade unionism. Although greater union densities do not make indus-
trial conflict any more likely, during periods when production systems
are changing and profoundly threatening inherited skills the conflicts
that erupt are on such a large-scale they assume a highly symbolic
nature. This is because they are not confined simply to the specific
work group or groups involved in the action, but engulf whole
communities. Alan McKinlay's work on inter-war shipyard riveters
has shown how important kinship networks are not only in terms of
recruitment to the trade, but also in enforcing solidarity during periods
of industrial struggle. [24 ] The 1984/85 miners' strike demonstrated the
importance of women's groups in the maintenance of solidarity.
Therefore, the tensions induced by the introduction of new tech-
nologies and the conflicts they produced tend to draw in whole com-
munities. In major industrial set pieces, this may have also involved
the worker community in an encounter with the state in the presence
of the police; normally seen by workers as pro-employer. Dealing
with the sharp end of the state's coercive arm inevitably produced a
politicising impact on the local community.
Thus, the workplace cannot be written off as having no relation-
ship with the world of politics. As industrial relations became
increasingly politicised by the state from the late nineteenth century
onwards workers in struggle were drawn into politics whether they
liked it or not. The cultural shift in social and political history with its
emphasis on discourse fails to take these factors into account and in

9

doing so separates politics from economics. This leads to a number
of intellectual problems which can be best illustrated by examining
the social history of class.

4. The Social History of Class

The implications of these studies of the labour process for working-
class politics in the nineteenth and twentieth century are highly
important. For if the history of workplace relations is the story of the
acceptance by the workers of the rights of private property and the
unsocial ownership of wealth, then how far did the legitimisation of
property also signify acceptance of the major institutions of liberal
capitalism? If the answer is one of affirmation, then, the whole
Marxist project regarding the historic mission of the working class to
overthrow capitalism and establish a socialist society is a false and
ahistorical one; a product of the philosophical imagination of a
German emigre. The political story of the working class can, there-
fore, be written as voluntary incorporation rather than as class
struggle. The Labour Party can be seen in this historical scenario as
the institutional expression of incorporationist tendencies with the
organised working class, instead of a vehicle for restructuring the
economic basis of society in favour of the proletariat. As Ross
McKibbin, in his celebrated essay, 'Why there was no Marxism in
Britain', put it:

Two of the prime assumptions of any Marxist party- a rejection
by much of the working class of existing social institutions and
a belief in the unity of 'economics' and 'politics'- simply did not
hold. The Labour Party was not free to choose between Marxism
and reformism but only between varieties of reformism. [25 ]

McKibbin's essay was a riposte to the dominance of Marxist thought
in historical studies in the 1960s and 1970s. Accepting the main
philosophical tenets of historical materialism, historians saw the his-
tory of the working class in relatively unproblematic ways. In these
accounts there was a clear and unambiguous relationship between
one's economic position and one's political behaviour. The historical
project of Marxist historiography was to discover why 'reformism'
had dominated the politics of the labour movement, rather than more
radical alternatives, then, to shift the workers in the latter direction.[26 ]
As a result, labour history was written as a series of disjunctures in

10

_Introduction_

which the forces of accommodation and struggle vied with each
other as rally points of working-class political allegiance. This way
of patterning the past led to the construction of a periodised scenario
peopled by the demons and heroes of class struggle.
Firstly, there was the period of political radicalism in which the
working class accepted middle-class political leadership and political
economy in an attempt to democratise the British state. The culmi-
nation of this phase of political struggle was the First Reform Act of
1832 in which the urban property owners were enfranchised. The
failure to include the working class in the constitution set the stage
for the next phase - Chartism. This movement for the political
enfranchisement of the working class was a reaction to middle-class
betrayal in 1832 and the establishment of the New Poor Law in
England in 1834. Chartism was the first independent political
expression of the proletariat, and through its political struggles an
ideology of class interests was developed and entrenched within the
worker's consciousness. Its failure to achieve its goals opened up a
period of class collaboration in the third quarter of the nineteenth
century in which the leadership of the working class, or labour
aristocracy, was bought off by the ruling class with the promise of
material and status rewards. The third phase saw the rise of socialism
as socialist agitators mobilised the previously unorganised unskilled
workers towards a new political alignment with skilled workers,
who themselves faced displacement by semi-skilled labour, due to
the growth of big business and technological change. The culmination
of this phase in the history of the working class was the formation
of the Labour Representation Committee in 1900. From this point
onwards the history of Labour became the struggle between
reformism and revolution. On the wider front, British politics had
polarised into working-class Labour and middle-class Tory, with the
Liberals in the political wilderness. Class, therefore, provided the
key to the understanding of the process of political change, which
was depicted by labour historians as inevitable and predictable.27

However, the sight of millions of trade unionists turning their
backs on Labour and voting for the Tories in 1983, moved historians
to question the basic assumptions of class interpretations of political
behaviour. The jettisoning of reductionist emphasis on the relationship
between economics and politics, saw the whole trajectory of Marxist-
inspired labour history undergo a profound revision. E. P. Thompson's
view that class consciousness emerged within the working class out
of the traumatic experience of industrialism, and that by 1832 it was

11


-----

'made', in the sense of having its own institutions and ideology, was
heavily attacked. Drawing on developments within post-modernism
which stressed the determining importance of language in shaping
political actions, Patrick Joyce argued that the language of 'the people'
was a far more potent shibboleth than the language of class. [28 ]
Thompson was further criticised for failing to show that his dispos-
sessed and displaced artisan radicals represented the 'working class',
rather than a small intellectual elite. Moreover, there was a tendency
to concentrate on the pre-industrial losers in the process of moderni-
sation at the expense of the winners.
The stress on language was also evident in Gareth Stedman Jones's
revisionist essay on Chartism. Discarding social explanations of the
rise of Chartism, Stedman Jones saw the movement as part of the
tradition of political radicalism dating back to the late eighteenth
century. Chartism, he argued, never developed a socialist critique of
the capitalist system and neither did it seek to establish a society
based on the common ownership of wealth. Chartism saw as its
constituency not simply the working class but 'the people', and it
employed a language of politics drawn from the radical tradition in
keeping with this vision. [29 ] The enemy still remained 'old corruption'
and hereditary power. As the _Chartist Circular put it:_

Hereditary power corrupted the whole government, poisoned
the press, demoralised society, prostituted the church, dissipated
the resources of the nation, created monopolies, paralysed
trade, ruined half the merchants, produced national bankruptcy
###### -it could be overthrown if capitalocracy united with the people. [30 ]

By establishing Chartism as a movement for political reform organ-
ised round the main shibboleths of the radical tradition, rather than
as a movement based on the political interests of a single class, once
the movement had collapsed, it was the core political values of that
radical tradition, rather than socialism, that motivated workers in
their continuing search for a share of political power. Biagini and
Reid, in a recent collection of influential essays on political radicalism,
argue that there 'is enough continuity in political radicalism [to] ...
demonstrate [that] ... social explanations of major changes [are]
unnecessary'. [31 ] They go on to stress the importance of radical
Liberalism in the early formation of the Labour Party, rejecting the
views of Marxist historians, such as Thompson and Hobsbawm, that
the latter was formed out of socialist activity amongst the unskilled,

12

_Introduction_

or that intensified class conflict brought it about. Thus, working-class
history in the nineteenth century can be viewed in terms of continuity
rather than in terms of disjuncture. Alastair Reid claims that there
was no 'widespread support for state socialism, whether of a revolu-
tionary or reformist type, among the British working people in this
period [1850-1914]'. [32 ] Indeed, the choice was between Liberal or
Conservative parties. However, if socialism was not an option for
working people in the period 1850-1914, how far did the experience
of the First World War and the inter-war depression create the kind
of class society, and with it the level of class struggle predicted by
Marx and his followers?
John Stevenson and Chris Cook in The Slump (1977) show British
society divided between a prosperous South and a depressed North,
with the rising living standards of the former contrasted with the
poverty and unemployment of the latter. They argue that there was
little threat to liberal democracy of the dimension faced by Germany
in the early 1930s because the main institutions of British society
still were accorded legitimacy by subordinate groups. The unemployed
were fatalistic rather than radical as extremist left-wing political
parties, such as the Communist Party, received only minuscule support
from redundant workers. Those in work gave overwhelming support
to the National government in the 1931 general election. Political
and industrial protest may have occurred in this period, but it rarely
amounted to more than a series of economistic demands for work,
improved wages and welfare benefits.
The Britain of the post-Second World War decades is the story of
dimming of class awareness as encapsulated in the work of Gold-
thorpe.33 Rising living standards saw consumption become the key
to understanding political behaviour rather than class. The old
communities and heavy industries which sustained notions of class
consciousness were swept away by housing redevelopment and the
transformation of the labour market due to the growth of the service
sector. The class structure which emerged from this profound period
of economic and social restructuring became more, rather than less,
complex. Braverman's prediction of a homogenised proletariat was
contradicted by the persistence of income and status differences, as
well as the recomposition of skills demanded by new computerised
technology. [34 ] The Conservative breakthrough in 1979 was the climax
of this long transformation in the economic and social fabric of
British society. Thatcher's electoral victory and the changes it has
wrought in society found even sympathetic voices on the left writing

that: 'Socialism is not inherent in the consciousness of the working
class, but is one possible development amongst others'. [35 ]
Class in this revisionist scenario is a meaningless concept in British
history as its relevance to the experience of working people is, at
best, tangential, and, at worst, irrelevant. It remains as only one of a
series of relatively minor forms of self-identity. As Patrick Joyce puts
it: it is 'seen less as objective reality than as a social construct'. [36 ]
Liberal capitalist, or social democratic regimes, survive not because
of coercion, or the 'false consciousness' of subordinate groups, but
through the freely given consent of workers and their families to the
major institutions of civil societyY

5. Languages of Class

The powerful revisionist critique of the role of class in British history
would appear to make a book on the Scottish working class a redun-
dant and an otherwise useless project; that is, of course, if we believe
that class is as jejune a concept as the revisionists would have us
believe. Not all historians and social scientists are prepared to follow
the revisionists down the yellow brick road to the classless society.
Although one can appreciate that reductionist theories of class linked
to teleological models of historical change may obscure more than
they shed light on issues concerned with social and political change,
does this mean that more refined and subtle usages of the concept
need be discarded too? Class interest and communual concerns over
religion, gender, ethnicity, and so on, can come into conflict with each
other leading to one or more of these factors obscuring the other as
focal points of identity and association, but any sophisticated use of the
concept of class should be able to accommodate these tensions. As
Eley and Nield comment, part of the problem of the post-modernists
in their messianic fervour to dethrone Marxism is:

The refusal to talk about Marxism as anything other than a
single and undifferentiated _thing . ... The vanished - or_ van-
quished - utility or plausibility of Marxism is apparently con-
nected in the minds of Joyce and others with the implosion of
the Soviet Union, and the irreversible 'failure' of the experiments
begun in 1917. [38 ]

Likewise, when it comes to the question of class the tests applied to
its currency by revisionists in explaining social and political behaviour

14


-----

_Introduction_

are so rigorous that the working class continues to fail to achieve a
pass mark. Only evidence of revolutionary consciousness is permitted
within the parameters of revisionist discourse as Patrick Joyce makes
clear. He defines class consciousness as the capacity of a class 'to
behave as a class actor' through organisation;[39 ] in other words the old
dichotomy of Marx's 'class in itself' and 'class for itself' rephrased.
Texts are scrutinised for any hint of departure from this pedantic
reading of class consciousness. But, as Neville Kirk points out, to
adopt such a severe test of class consciousness would be to write off
almost all of the working-class political activity in Britain from the
1840s to the 1990s.[40 ] This point is underscored by Michael Mann
when he says that 'classes have never had a full, pure and indepen-
dent life'.[41 ] For a variety of reasons classes fail the tests of Stedman
Jones and Joyce, but what is of concern is that failure pushes us even
further down the linguistic path of analysis.
By rejecting the link between social being and consciousness, post-
modernists are heading, as Ralph Miliband argues, in the direction
of subjectivism in which 'notions of class, structure and society itself,
cease to be regarded as proper tools of analysis'.[42 ] Indeed, the stress on
language, or the 'text', as the only means of analysis leads to a form
of linguistic determinism in which human agency and non-linguistic
historical phenomena are considered irrelevant or unknowable.
Within this new framework of analysis the influence of literary criti-
cism allows historical documents to be stripped of any referential or
contextual links, which misses the obvious point that language, and
the way it is understood, depends on the context in which it is artic-
ulated. If that was not the case then language itself could not be the
object of historical analysis since it would be timeless. As Neville
Kirk points out: 'if reality does not extend beyond representation in
language and discourse how is it possible to investigate the links
between "the linguistic", "the social", "the political" and "the eco-
nomic"'.43 There is, then, obviously a relationship between language
and structure; a relationship which can be further explored by exam-
ining in some detail Stedman Jones's revisionist critique of traditional
interpretations of Chartism.
Stedman Jones, as we have seen above, saw Chartism as move-
ment of the 'people' bound together by subscription to a common
political language, rather than the first politically organised expression
of the industrial proletariat. But as John Foster points out, the lan-
guage of radicalism is a 'historian's construct'.[44 ] What Chartists said
is perfectly well-known; what they meant, and how that language

###### 15


-----

was interpreted by the 'people' is altogether a different matter.
Searching the voluminous writings connected with Chartism can
lead the historian in diametrically opposing directions in which the
language of the people vies with the language of class. Such linguistic
tensions have always existed within Chartist texts. The above quota-
tion from the Chartist Circular can be set aside the following quotation
from a leading Chartist:

###### If they will not reform this, aye uproot it, they shall have the
revolution they so much dread. We shall destroy their abodes of
guilt .... If they will not ... [provide] that every man shall by
his labour find comfortable food and clothing for his wife and
###### babes- then we swear ... that from the East, the West, the
North and the South, we shall warp in one sheet of devouring
flame ... the manufactories of the cotton tyrants, and the places
of those who raised them by rapine and murder, and founded
upon them the wretchedness of millions whom God ... created
to be happy. [45 ]

Although blood-curdlingly unsophisticated compared to Marxist
analysis, the sense of class hatred is clearly and overwhelmingly
articulated. It is also clear from a reading of more moderate Chartist
texts that incorporation into the constitution was never seen as an end
in itself, but as a way of redressing economic and social grievances.
Neville Kirk, in his analysis of the writings of leading Lancashire
Chartists, also makes this point, showing them to be acutely aware of
class and exploitation. [46 ] Stedman Jones, therefore, in his eagerness to
establish the continuity of Chartism with previous forms of political
radicalism, seems to be guilty of a selective reading of the movement's
texts. In reality, Chartism was a diverse political and social move-
ment which spoke to a great deal of concerns, although primarily to
the working class. The diversity of the political constituency, which
included at various times pre-industrial workers, such as handloom
weavers and colliers, and more modern workers, such as cotton
spinners, along with petty bourgeois types, and a complex array of
religious and social visionaries, demanded a varied political language
that on inspection is riddled with contradictions and inconsistencies.
Justification for one, highly particular, reading of Chartism simply
does not hold up.
Whether linguistic analysis provides the key to unlocking the mys-
teries of the past and making more rigorous our approach to its study

_Introduction_

is, thus, open to severe doubt. But the debates engendered by the 'lin-
guistic turn' have been fruitless. The stress on language has led to the
abandonment of simplistic reductionist notions of the role of class. It
has also made us more aware of the differences and complexities
within working-class communities, and drawn our attention to the
need to adopt a more critical analysis of the documents of working-
class life. But, in spite of these undoubted gains, the influence of post-
modernism has had a baneful impact on labour and social history.
###### It has influenced historians to jettison accepted and worthwhile cat-
egories of analysis with bewildering speed and with little regard to
the intellectual consequences. The extremism of the post-modern
revolutions has led even those broadly sympathetic to the linguistic
turn to comment that:

Although class history is fading, the histories that remain still
present a story of power relationships and exploitation ...

[and] while a history based on ideal class types may have run
into the ground, a history that testifies to the ongoing narratives
of subordination and social discipline continues.[47 ]

Even Patrick Joyce has recognised that there existed tendencies in
the nineteenth century towards a unity of labour experience and class
solidarity and that this could fuse in times of economic and political
crisis. He concludes his review of the relationship between social
class and political radicalism by saying: 'Simply, class mattered' .[48 ]
###### It would appear that, at least, some revisionist historians do not
quite wish to throw the baby out with the bath water. The concept of
class remains central to our understanding of historical development,
not simply because it is a convenient tool of positional measurement
within the social-structure, but also because it allows us to address
the larger historical questions linked to the distribution of power and
wealth in society. By focusing on the working class as the most dis-
advantaged and exploited section of society, and its relationship with
other more advantaged groups, the nature of power and authority in
all their guises is made clearer. The working class, however, is not a
static economic category. It is re-made and re-makes itself in a dialec-
tical interplay as changes which occur in the economic and social
structure of capitalism elicit political responses. As I was informed
as an undergraduate at the University of Edinburgh by R. J. Morris,
class formation is an historical process; since that time there has been
little written to convince me otherwise of the compelling nature of

17


-----

his insight. The working class of today may be quite different to that
which emerged in the first half of the nineteenth century - muscle is
less of a qualification for membership in an economy dominated by
services than it was 150 years ago- however, powerlessness and
exploitation remain a fact of working-class life in modern society.
Moreover, the traditional working class has not disappeared. Manual
workers made up 51.8 per cent of all employees in 1980; a figure
higher for men at 55 per cent than women at 35 per cent. As Eley
and Nield eloquently put it:

We accept that class is being re-composed; it is not available in
its previous manifest forms; it is no longer recognizable via
former iconographies, typologies and embodiments. But this
does not mean that either capitalism or its characteristic forms
of exploitation have gone away. Current analyses of race, gender,
space, sexuality, ethnicity are important not least for their pur-
chase on changing modes of ensuring an inequitable distribution
of the product. They provide access to the late capitalist modal-
ities of exploitation and inequality- of class- in this sense. [49 ]

The recognition of the enduring nature of capitalist social relations
ensures that class remains a salient feature of socio-political analyses.
As Michael Savage and Andrew Miles conclude:

The working class is constantly being made and re-made, and the
political implications of class formation are often ambiguous
and uncertain ... as long as we live in an unequal society, in
which some people exploit others, class divisions are likely to
have profound political ramifications. [50 ]

6. Rethinking Class

Class, then, still matters, but it is important that it is studied in a
dialectical way as a social entity subject, in the case of the working
class, to recomposition, constantly negotiating and re-negotiating its
relationship to other social classes and interests groups, rather than
as a fixed and immutable economic category. There should also be
an awareness of the tensions within the working class which result
from divisions based on skill, gender, ethnicity, religion and nation-
alism. The model used in this book is one which tries to encompass
the insights derived from post-modernist writings with the more

18


-----

traditional concerns of labour and social history. Although on the
surface the process of social and political change may appear to be
theorised in a relatively unproblematic and somewhat linear manner,
the nuances and subtleties of class and inter-class relationships are
prominent in the analysis. In dealing with the history of class forma-
tion and structure the book takes as its starting point the nature of
the economy and the level of technology, since it is the way they
interact with each other that determines the structure of the labour
market and the mechanisms of income distribution. The inequalities
and insecurities which result from a hierarchically structured system of
rewards, the trade cycle and an ever-changing technological produc-
tion regime create common or shared experiences and grievances
among wage earners. These give rise to the need to organise to protect
oneself, family and community from the vicissitudes of impersonal
economic forces.
Organisation is at first localised. However, as capital grows and
nationalises itself labour follows suit assisted by the spread of com-
munications and transport. The larger the organisations, the greater
the potential for conflict and disruption, and the greater the necessity
for the state to adopt an interventionist role in industrial relations.
The more the state intervenes, the more it acts to politicise industrial
relations, and the more it is viewed as pro-employer by workers.
Recognition of bias in the state's actions pushes the trade unions in
the direction of politics, eventually resulting in the formation of an
independent working-class political party, since middle-class parties
cannot accommodate in whole the interests of labour. Indeed, all
successful labour and socialist parties have evolved out of the trade
unions and survive and grow because of this political bond. While
this might appear teleological, the question of speed of formation,
the nature of the ethos and ideology of the party, become more prob-
lematic and draw in factors concerned with ethnicity, gender, religion,
regionalism, and nationality. It is these sometimes ambiguous, com-
peting and contradictory factors which act to prevent the emergence
of any predestined or given pathway of labour's political development.
Their influence also demonstrates the need to view labour's arrival
and continued presence on the national stage of politics as a constant
process of negotiation and re-negotiation. Theories based on predes-
tination fail to answer obvious, but important, questions of timing,
such as why, when the objective economic conditions of insecurity and
poverty were conducive to the formation of an independent working-
class party, did it take until1906 in Britain? Relying on sloppy theories

19


-----

of 'false consciousness', or vanguardism, prevents us from engaging
with the realities of working-class consciousnesss and creates ulti-
mately unhistorical categories of analysis.
Questions concerning the nature and content of political conscious-
ness can only be addressed by developing a dialectical and subtle
model of social and political change which allows for the interplay
between the economic, the social and the political. This has obvious
implications for the way the subject is written about. Adopting a
totalising historical approach necessarily involves an abandonment
of reductionist views of class, and also of workerist models of social
change which abstract the workplace, and the social relations it
gives rise to, from the wider community, in favour of a model which
establishes linkages between the workplace, the community and the
political system, and which takes account of the relationship of mate-
rial conditions to thought and language. Although the focus of this
particular study is the Scottish working class's experience of industrial
capitalism and the responses this engendered at a variety of levels,
the underlying aim is to realise this conceptual desideratum.

7. Scottish Historians and Class History

The study of the Scottish working-class's historical development
offers an important and instructive corrective to the almost exclu-
sively anglocentric focus of current debates on the issues of class and
class formation. Indeed, the failure to consider the experience of
workers in the celtic fringe of Britain is somewhat bewildering given
the suitability of these regions for examining the relationship of class
to other socio-political factors. Scotland stands out as a paramount
ommission in this respect. Economically, it has traditionally experi-
enced higher levels of poverty and lower wages than England and
Wales, had a higher proportion of immigrants from Ireland, and, in
the west of Scotland, the greatest concentration of skilled workers
anywhere in Europe with the possible exception of the Ruhr. Socially,
Scotland has suffered extreme inter-class divisions resulting from
religious sectarianism and endured higher levels of overcrowding and
low amenity housing than the rest of Britain. Politically, it was more
entrenched in support in the nineteenth century for the Liberal Party,
and more for Labour in the twentieth century, than anywhere else
in Britain. Moreover, in recent years the Scottish working class has
undergone profound restructuring with the shift from heavy industry
to services and light manufacturing which has all but destroyed the

20


-----

skilled, male, Protestant culture. In spite of this, Scotland has bucked
the electoral trends exhibited elsewhere in the UK since 1979 by
steadfastly and increasingly voting Labour, while, at the same time,
encompassing a growing movement for national independence. These
factors alone make Scotland an interesting and almost ideal social
laboratory to test recent theses concerning the demise of class. At the
very least, it allows for a greater comparative dimension to be added
to an agenda dominated by insular and nationalist concerns of English
historians and social scientists.
Indeed, the political development of the Scottish working class has
taken a different trajectory from that of its English counterpart. It has
been more influenced by the rational and educational philosophies of
the eighteenth-century Enlightenment than has the English. [51 ] This
has resulted in moral suasion and rational argument being a more
powerful part of the armoury of political resistance north of the
border than south. As a consequence of the stress on literacy and
education by a Calvinist-dominated social theology, the tradition of
auto-didactism and self-improvement was entrenched in the working
class and the labour movement from an early stage. Somewhat con-
tradictorily, given the influence of rational thought, the labour
movement in Scotland also adopted the moral concerns of Calvinism,
hence the powerful influence of temperance, something which
appealed to both moderates and revolutionaries alike. 5[2 ] Religion itself
has exercised a longer and more powerful grip on the consciousness
of workers in Scotland than in England, with higher levels of mem-
bership and attendance throughout the nineteenth and twentieth
centuries. [53 ] The divisions caused by sectarianism's purchase on
working-class affections have proved a much more disabling factor
in Labour's political progress than in England, with the possible
exception of Liverpool, and in spite of the traditional religious
enmity between Anglicans and Methodists. [54 ] The other major differ-
ence between Scotland and England has been the potently enduring
appeal of national self-government. The enduring tensions over the
hugely unpopular settlement of 1707 have seen Home Rule figure as
an important and enduring symbol of working-class resistance,
particularly to the landed elite. Anti-landlordism has featured more
strongly in the political agitation north of the border, not least
because of the Highland Clearances, and the large waves of High-
land and Irish migration to the urban central belt of Scotland.[55 ]
Unfortunately, there exists no history of the Scottish working class
which provides an overarching account of its development since the

21


-----

1800s to the present, or attempts to synthesise the various strands
and nationally specific peculiarities of this development within a
totalising model of socio-political change. However, a number of
studies do exist which address themselves to working-class history.
The first of these was Thomas Johnston's whiggish interpretation of
the rise of labour in Scotland - A History of the Working Classes in
_Scotland (1923). Since then only two serious attempts have been made_
to offer some kind of overview of working-class history in modern
Scotland- J.D. Young's _The Rousing of the Scottish Working Class_
(1979) and T. C. Smout's A Century of the Scottish People, _1830-1950_
(1986). However, both studies provide only partial accounts of the
historical experience of the Scottish working class and the chapters
are written with little attempt to synthesise their conclusions and fit
them into the wider perspectives of class history. Also their concerns
and ideological positions are very different: Young presents a class in
constant struggle for emancipation, while Smout, in a more subtle
account, shows how the working class accommodated itself to the
main institutions of power and authority in Scottish, and British,
society.
Both Smout and Young show the influence of E. P. Thompson's
'history from below approach'; an approach which with the publica-
tion of The Making of the English Working Class ( 1963) signalled a
move away from institutional labour history to a social history of the
working class. With this shift the whole question of class and class
consciousness became the focal point of labour history and was
treated as problematical rather than being taken for granted. In
practice, the new approach meant that labour history was less con-
cerned with union structure and institutional political histories and
more with the workplace, the family, the community and popular
struggles. Thompson's intervention made people more aware of the
differences within the working class and this resonated with the grow-
ing disenchantment of those historians operating within the so-called
celtic fringe of Britain with English-based history.
The disillusionment of historians in Scotland coincided with a
resurgence of the national question as the key item on the Scottish
political agenda in the 1970s. Both the volume and quality of his-
torical writing were greatly enhanced at this time as the dramatic
revival of the Scottish national movement, in part, accompanied and,
in part, stimulated a greater interest in Scottish history, society and
culture in its own right. Labour historians became concerned to
define the distinctive national characteristics of the Scottish labour

_Introduction_

movement, in particular, and the working class, in general. From this
came a very distinctive kind of historical project which had as its
overriding concern the need to delineate and define the organisations,
interests, values and politics of the skilled, male, Protestant worker.
However, in spite of its narrow focus, the gains from this approach
have not been negligible. An impressive amount of published material
in recent years has illuminated the darker areas of the experience of
the skilled worker within the context of the workplace and the wider
society. The work of Braverman on the capitalist labour process has
influenced a great deal of research on the question of deskilling in
Scottish industry. Studies of shipbuilding, engineering and coalmining
have stressed the means by which skilled workers adapted to the
changing imperatives of production and how this allowed them to
sustain the craft culture in spite of economic decline. [56 ] The work of
R. Q. Gray on the artisan elite of mid-nineteenth-century Edinburgh
has highlighted the ways in which skill and status in the workplace
resonated with wider societal values to establish a culture of
respectabilityY Regrettably, Gray's work has not been satisfactorily
extended into the twentieth century, but there are a number of indi-
vidual studies of aspects of class culture, for example, on temperance
and religion, which are of interest in this connection. [58 ]
However, given the overconcentration on skilled workers, it would
appear to anyone new to Scottish labour history that certain sections
of the working class will have only to be seen to play a minor role in
shaping its historical development. These omissions have distorted
the historical record. As a result of the process of exclusion, women
and the whole issue of gender in the workplace and politics have
been severely under-researched. Women's issues and their position in
the class structure have been traditionally marginalised in labour
historiography north of the border, although to some extent this has
been addressed in the last decade or so. However, in spite of worthy
attempts by historians to alter the focus of labour history, the volume
of published work on working-class women is small and does little
to alter the impression of historical marginality. [59 ] Similarly, material
on white-collar workers and their experiences in the workplace,
their involvement in trade unionism, and their political behaviour is
virtually non-existent. [60 ] More crucially, outside of a consideration of
the labour market, there has been a general lack of interest shown
in the position of the unskilled worker. The changing nature of
unskilled work, the historical narrowing of wage differentials in
industry and the relationships this created between skilled and

23


-----

unskilled, as well as the rise of unskilled unions, have not as yet
excited the interest of Scottish historians to any large degree. The
only full-scale published study of unskilled workers in Scotland and
their unions is Angela Tuckett's institutional history of the Scottish
carters and motormen, although recent work by William Kennefick
on dockers holds out the promise that this lucana will at some point
in the future be addressed. [61 ]
More impressive progress has been made in the areas of ethnicity
and popular struggles of the radical era. The role of the Irish Catholic
immigrants in shaping the development of the Scottish working class
and the labour movement is now more widely appreciated than it was
twenty years ago. [62 ] However, the phenomenon of internal migration
from the Scottish Highlands to the Lowland cities is not as yet well
understood, [63 ] although there is little doubt that the presence of two
ethnic communities competing in the same labour markets exacer-
bated sectarian and national tensions. There is also much evidence, as
we have said, to support the idea that the existence of large migrant
communities pushed the early socialist organisations in the direction
of land reform. [64 ] Anti-landlordism linked with the idea of Home
Rule for Ireland and Scotland became an essential and self-evident
part of the political culture of the Scottish working class and the
Labour Party north of the border in the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries.
The struggles over land reform were part of a tradition of popular
revolt against authority and deprivation dating back to the late
eighteenth century. During the first phase of industrialisation the
struggle was mainly aimed at democratising Scottish and British poli-
tics through reforming the franchise. Although normally peaceable,
at times the conflicts assumed greater intensity which pushed the
participants in the direction of insurrection and violence. Rioting was
a frequent response by working people to unfavourable economic
conditions, but as the industrial system became more entrenched the
unrest increasingly took a political form, culminating in the Radical
War of 1820. Strikes and the use of insurrectionary violence to over-
throw (unsuccessfully) the British state emphasised the growing class
dimensions of Scottish politics. Such incidents form the backcloth
to ongoing debates among Scottish historians regarding the vexed
question of class and class consciousness. While few historians in
Scotland would accept the completeness of class formation articulated
in Thompson's epic work, there has emerged a division among the
former over the degree of class consciousness exhibited by Scottish

24

_Introduction_

workers in this period. [65 ] Although the debates are still in progress, it
can be argued that they have been carried out within the parameters
set by a historiography that fails to take account of the new work on
politics and language. The insights of revisionist historians such as
Stedman Jones into the meanings and significance of political dis-
course and the language of class struggle in this period have not been
incorporated in a serious way into the evaluations of class formation
and political struggle. The main text on Scottish Chartism - A.
Wilson, _The Chartist Movement in Scotland_ (1970)- was written
over twenty-five years ago.
In spite of these conceptual failings, the more recent studies of
political radicalism have the virtue that they are set within a consid-
eration of wider questions of class formation, although significantly
little appreciation of the economic basis of exploitation or the labour
process exists in them. Other works on popular agitation in nine-
teenth-century Scotland lack this conceptual dimension; in particular,
studies of the political development of the women's movement are
almost bereft of any conceptual awareness. [66 ] This is compensated to
some extent by the studies of the struggles on Clydeside during the
period 1915-1919. Here we witness evidence of the impact of more
recent sophisticated and nuanced approaches to social historyP
However, even among the more informed and intellectually rigorous
historians of the 'Red Clyde', there remains a tendency to highlight
moments of heroic class struggle and disjuncture at the expense of
wider, more discreet and continuous narratives of class history.
The tendency to focus almost exclusively on the heroic at the
expense of the mundane is understandable, but the silences of the past
have left the working class in modern Scotland unable to compre-
hend or make intelligible its own history. There are no overarching
histories of the development of the Scottish working class or the
Labour Party in Scotland which cover the period 1918 to the present.
Thus, the historical memory of popular mobilisation and struggle has,
outside of 'Red Clydeside', been virtually erased from the conscious-
ness of even the organised working class. And while other European
socialist parties have continued to mobilise historic symbols of
popular resistance which speak to contemporary concerns, [68 ] currently
Labour in Scotland has to operate within an iconography - the rose
###### -and language- neo-liberalism- borrowed from other political tra-
ditions that address themselves solely to instrumental and functional
concerns over consumption.
Ambitious it might be in terms of period and scope, this study

25


-----

cannot hope to fill the lacuna or make wholly intelligible the silences
of the past. There remains too much work to be done in this direction.
What the book does attempt to do is to synthesise the author's own
original research with other published monographs and articles. By
doing so it is hoped that a more theoretically credible and challenging
account of the development of the working class in modern Scotland
can be produced.
The study is split into five main time periods. The first period deals
with the impact of industrialisation and technological change on the
growth of working-class organisations in the workplace and in the
political realm, culminating in the rise and fall of Chartism. The second
period covers the decades of the the third quarter of the nineteenth
century and addressess itself to questions regarding the demise of the
radical Chartist agenda and the creation of socio-political consensus
in Scottish, and British, society. The third period deals with the rise
of Labour to 1914 and asks whether this posed a real challenge to
the Liberal hegemony north of the border in the light of important
changes in the workplace and in trade union organisation. The fourth
period addresses the issues connected with the debates on 'Red
Clydeside' and extends this into the inter-war period, examining how
mass unemployment and widespread social dislocation forced the
ethos and politics of the Scottish labour movement to undergo a
fundamental revision. The final period of the book analyses the
impact of far-reaching economic and technological change on the
occupational and social structure of Scottish society, in particular,
looking at destruction of the skilled, male Protestant culture; asking
why this did not lead to a fundamental re-structuring of the political
landscape as happened in England in the late 1970s and 1980s.
Dividing the book into these time periods is done for convenience
sake; it does not mean that the approach to working-class history
taken is insensitive to the importance of the continuity of older forms
of social relationships, past political practices, values and attitudes in
shaping current configurations of social and political relations.
Because of its pioneering nature and large chronological terrain
covered, the study will no doubt appear, at times, faltering in its
methodology and interpretations. However, perhaps it is more
important to initiate the process of dialogue with all the dangers and
pitfalls inherent in it, than to maintain a silence on these contentious
theoretical and historical issues. After all the history of the Scottish
working class and its organisations is rich in content, and rewarding
in study, offering those who wish to delve into it valuable comparisons

which are illuminating and instructive in dealing with the nature of
class and class formation in Britain and elsewhere. If this book suc-
ceeds in winning the recognition of this from anglocentric historians,
then perhaps it will mark the end of the peripheralisation of the
experience of those workers on the celtic fringe of Britain. From this
a truly comprehensive and comparative account of the historical
evolution of the 'British', rather than the 'English', working class
may emerge in the future. The argument for it could not be more
compelling, or the moment more appropriate, given the present
debates regarding national identity initiated by Linda Colley's study of
the formation of British nationalism in the eighteenth century. [69 ]

 INTERPRETATIONS

The Great Reform Act of 1832 marked a turning point in the political
history of Scotland and Britain as a whole. The enfranchisement of
the non-landowning propertied classes climaxed decades of political
agitation dating back to the 1780s, and resolved the main tension
between the different strata of property regarding the question of 'no
taxation without representation'. Although the main offices of the
state remained in the hands of the aristocracy, the political economy
of the government, particularly with the repeal of the Corn Laws in
1846, became more attuned to furthering the interests of the indus-
trial arm of capital. These political changes belatedly reflected the
shift in wealth-holding and ownership of property in Britain which had
taken place since the mid-eighteenth century and had been ushered
in by the series of economic and technological changes which we, for
convenience sake, call the Industrial Revolution. However, while in
Scotland the Edinburgh Whigs and their middle-class supporters
congratulated themselves on their constitutional triumph, another
section of society had much less reason to be enthusiastic. Working
people had campaigned as ardently as the middle classes for the
franchise, but had found themselves ignored in the new constitu-
tional arrangements following 1832. This sense of alienation in the
sphere of politics was intensified in England by the introduction of
the oppressive New Poor Law in 1834 and in Scotland by the failure
of its Radical MPs to support reform of the Factory Acts. These
political actions only served to underline the growing distance in the
workplace between capital and labour. Social and political factors thus
conflated after 1832 to create profound feelings of disenchantment
with the new British state in working communities and from this
emerged the Chartist movement in the late 1830s.
Although as a political movement Chartism failed in its mission to
win a share of political power for the working classes, and was a
spent force by 1850, its activities have generated a great deal of

31


-----

debate as to whether it constituted a movement of a single class or a
'people'. The debate has been fuelled by the revisionist writings of
Gareth Stedman Jones, who, as we have seen, argued that Chartism
cannot be understood as a knee-jerk response to the social distress of
industrialisation, nor can it be understood 'in forms of consciousness
of a particular social class, since the form pre-existed any independent
action by such a class'. [1 ]This view is underscored by R. Q. Gray who
urges us to take 'seriously' Chartism's rhetoric of 'the people' and
'not dissolve that specific identity into class or occupational bases' .[2 ]
The ideological rupture prefaced by Stedman Jones's intervention
has provided a strong and compelling alternative interpretation to
older, more class-based analyses. It is surely correct to stress that
Chartism was part of an ongoing political tradition of radicalism
which pre-figures the creation of social class. Equally, it seems per-
fectly acceptable to question the wisdom of analysing Chartism using
Marx's concept of class consciousness, or to see it as a defining
moment in the history of socialism. However, to suggest, as he does,
that the movement can be abstracted from the material conditions
in which it took root appears less than helpful. [3 ] This type of idealistic,
non-referential analysis of Chartism can only be sustained by assum-
ing that the language of Chartism was in itself uncontradictory and
that it was capable of coalescing disparate groups of the politically
powerless within a commonly understood political vocabulary.
While to an extent Chartism achieved this latter goal, its success in
mobilising 'the people' was only ever realised because its language of
political reform was appropriated and 'deconstructed' by each of
the social constituencies which made it up in ways which addressed
their own particular sets of aspirations and grievances. The social
experiences of industrialisation, particularly privation, squalor and
unemployment, helped mobilise the powerless in a popular revolt
against state power; a revolt which gained increased momentum
during downturns in the trade cycle. The language of political reform
made sense to many in this context because it appeared to offer relief
from harsh social policies and economic hardship. The link with the
social was also confirmed by the fact that political reform was never
seen by the Chartist constituency as an end in itself; indeed, it was an
integral part of a wider programme of social reform which included
a more generous poor law, a progressive system of taxation, and so on.
Linguistic explanations of the development of political radicalism
have, therefore, a useful, but limited, role in explaining Chartism's
rise and fall, or its relationship to the development of working-class

_Interpretations_

consciousness. Part of the problem is that Stedman Jones and other
historians influenced by post-modernist trends have relied on an ideal
type of Chartism with little regard paid to the regional differences
which were apparent in its leadership, organisation, rhetoric and
value system. Without wishing to pre-empt the foregoing analysis,
Scotland had a higher proportion of Chartist Churches than anywhere
else in Britain, and temperance also played an important part in
shaping the values of Chartists north of the border. It is little wonder
that political speeches by Chartist leaders were heavily weighted with
religious symbolism and that their choirs sang with gusto verses three
to eight of the ninety-fourth Psalm.[4 ] Moreover, given the strength of
anti-landlord feeling in Scotland, attacks on hereditary privilege
resonated more powerfully with the consciousness of Scottish
workers, many of whom were rural migrants, than in other parts of
Britain. Diversity on this scale has to be understood by a referential
analysis which links material conditions to the development of
political consciousness. Therefore, to understand fully Chartism's
origins, appeal and ultimate demise in the case of Scotland, we must:
firstly, delineate the shifting character of the country's social and eco-
nomic bases, with particular reference to the occupational structure,
emigration and the growth of urban settlements; secondly, show
how technology altered the nature and distribution of skills and how
this affected the development of workplace and community solidar-
ities; and, finally, examine whether the Chartist experience altered
the political consciousness of the working classes in Scotland in the
long term.

##### THE SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES OF INDUSTRIAL AND URBAN GROWTH,

#### 1800-1850

Under the impact of the new economic history industrialisation has
now come to be viewed as an evolutionary rather than a revolutionary
process. [5 ] A regional perspective, however, offers the possibility of a
different interpretation of the British economy's development. [6 ]
Because of the pivotal role played by the cotton industry north of the
border in the process of industrialisation, compared to England,
Scotland's economy developed in a series of dynamic stages. From an
economy based primarily, but not exclusively, on agriculture in the
eighteenth century, Scotland developed in a short space of time an
overwhelming reliance on textiles, particularly cotton, before under-
going a transformation after 1840 to heavy industry. Although older
forms of production co-existed with more modern ones, and Scotland
in 1830 could still be described by one historian as a 'rural country' ,7
it was nevertheless true that by 1840 it had become 'irreversibly a
different kind of society'. [8 ] Even landed society had experienced massive
changes in its social structure with the peasantry, or sub-tenancy, of
Lowland Scotland being swept away between 1780 and 1820. [9 ]

In the period 1780-1840 it was textiles, with its novel methods of
organising work, its rapidly changing technologies and its dynamic
growth, which was the engine of economic growth. By 1826 nine out
of ten manufacturing workers in Scotland were in textiles, with a ratio
of six workers in cotton to three in linen, to one in wool. [10 ] Indeed,
everywhere textiles was the dominant manufacturing employer, even
in the less industrially developed east of Scotland. By 1843 a quarter
of the population of Aberdeen, and a third of that of Edinburgh,
were employed in textiles. However, in Glasgow the figure was nearly
3 7 per cent in 1841, while in smaller towns such as Paisley the numbers

34

were even larger. [11 ] The spinning factories tended to be large by con-
temporary standards with more than 150 workers being the norm by
1840, although in Glasgow the figure was higher at 244. [12 ] The large
outlays of capital involved in constructing and equipping a factory
meant that the structure of ownership favoured partnerships over
family or sole control. This closed off avenues of mobility for artisans
and small farmers as the industry became dominated by capitalists.
With large numbers of workers and capitalist ownership and control,
textiles, and in particular cotton spinning, gave birth to the modern
industrial proletariat in Scotland. And as the 1840s wore on that
trend intensified with the mean workforce in textiles put at 662 per
firm in 1851; a figure much higher than that in England.U

However, although dynamic, the growth of textiles was uneven,
with the weaving sector lagging behind spinning. In Paisley and the
surrounding area there was only one power-loom factory in 1837,
while in Lancashire the weaving process had been almost completely
mechanised by this date. [14 ] The domestic system of production con-
tinued to dominate weaving in Scotland with handloom weavers
being numbered in tens of thousands: Glasgow alone was estimated to
employ 20 000 in 1831, while for the country as a whole the figure
was around 84500 in 1840. [15 ] With average weekly wages for hand-
loom weavers as low as 6s 6d a week in 1831, the abundance of
cheap labour retarded the drive towards mechanisation. [16 ]In spite of the
fact that in the east of Scotland all the carpet weaving in Dunfermline
was factory-based, and over 1000 of Aberdeen's weavers were
employed in factories, as well as a quarter of Arbroath's and five-sixths
of Montrose's weaving population, 'factory weavers represented
only a small minority of the workforce even in the east of Scotland
and the typical webster of the area, even as late as 1840, was still
the domestic outworker'. [17 ] However, in the Border towns woollen
weavers, although the handloom still predominated, were being
increasingly grouped in loom-shops 'in the interests of managerial
efficiency' .[18 ] Employers persisted with labour intensive methods of
production as it avoided them having to shoulder the burden of high
overhead costs during economic downturns. The weavers were dis-
missed or simply denied webs; stocks of cloth built up in good times
saw the employers through the bad.
The limited manufacturing base combined with the uneven devel-
opment in the cotton industry had a retarding effect on the wider
economy. Transportation was slow to develop with the only railway
of note in Scotland in 1832 being the Garnkirk/Glasgow line of

35


-----

eight-and-a-quarter miles. It was not until 1842 that Edinburgh was
linked by rail to Glasgow, and it took until 1848 for a rail link to be
established between the capital city and England. The low level of
demand in the economy for capital goods necessarily slowed the
progress of the coal and iron industries. Although output increased
thirteen-fold in the period 1700-1830, it was still far short of Lanca-
shire, Wales and the South-West of EnglandY Coalmining until
after 1832 was basically an industry which supplied local markets.
Low levels of demand allowed miners to follow a dual occupation in
some parts of the west of Scotland. Until 1840 many colliers were
'tenants or owners of small holdings'; as, indeed, were linen weavers
        - it was not until 1820 that weaving became a full-time occupation
in the east of Scotland and, even as late as 183 8, over a quarter
absented themselves during the summer harvest. [20 ] Shipbuilding was
a small affair on Clydeside based mainly on wood and sail; indeed,
in 1831 Aberdeen with a workforce of 681 men was arguably the
most important centre of this activity in Scotland. [21 ] To underline
the limited development of Scotland's industrial base at this time
agriculture and domestic service were still the largest employers of
labour in 1851.22
However, in spite of the importance of older forms of employment,
the decade after 1830 witnessed a massive leap forward in terms of
the modernisation of Scotland's economic base. Following the intro-
duction of Neilson's hot blast furnace in 1828, which dramatically
lowered the cost of pig-iron production north of the border, Scotland's
share of British output grew from 5 to 25 per cent, or from c.37 500
tons in 1830 to 700 000 in 1849.[23 ] The railway building mania of
the 1840s had much to with the mushroom growth of the Scottish
iron industry, and it in turn had multiplier effects on other parts of
the economy. Coal production soared from 3m tons in 1830 to
around 7.4m in 1851, with 76 per cent of this produced in the west
of Scotland. [24 ] Steamship building also benefited from the surge in
cheap iron production, and by 1850 the Clyde was responsible for
66 per cent of the tonnage of iron vessels in Britain.[25 ] These develop-
ments, according to Chris Whatley, meant that in a very short space
of time Scotland had become 'more industrialised than the rest of
Britain', although even north of the border industrial employment
was more concentrated in Strathclyde, Central, Fife and Tayside than
elsewhere in the country. [26 ]
The growth of textiles and ancillary trades, such as chemicals, and,
later, heavy industry drew in thousands of migrants to the cities and

36

the growing industrial towns of the west of Scotland. Scotland which
had been tenth in the world's urban league in 1700 was fourth by

1800, and second only to England and Wales by 1851.27 Under the
weight of mass migration places such as Glasgow mushroomed with
the population growing from 77 000 in 1801 to 275 000 forty years
later. Small industrial towns also grew spectacularly in this period
with Paisley's population more than doubling in twenty years. By
1841 70 per cent of the population of the west of Scotland was living
in urban settlements. [28 ]
Migration played a major role in the growth of urban settlements
with 53 per cent of the inhabitants of the ten largest Scottish towns
in 1851 being born elsewhere. [29 ] Hugh Miller, stonemason, recalled
in his autobiography that in Edinburgh in the mid-1820s 'less than
one-fourth' of the mechanics he made an acquaintance with were
'natives of the place'. The rest had migrated to the capital from
'country districts and small towns'. [30 ] As early as 1801, 29 per cent
of the population of Greenock was from the Scottish Highlands, and
by 1851, 54 000 Highlanders had settled in the west of Scotland.[31 ]
Indeed, Highlanders tended on the whole to migrate to the western
Lowlands, with 60 per cent of them living there in 1851.[32 ] On top
of this came Irish immigration. Although constant since the late
eighteenth century, emigration from Ireland tended to be temporary.
In spite of this 4.8 per cent, or 126 321, of Scotland's population was
Irish-born; however, in the west of Scotland the figure was much
higher. Forty-four thousand, or 16 per cent, of Glasgow's population
in 1841 was Irish-born, but if we include those of Irish extraction the
figure might be put at double this. [33 ] Although most were Catholics,
there was a sizeable Irish Protestant community in Glasgow by this
time. James Cleland, the early statistician of Glasgow, estimated that
of a total Irish population of 35 534, 8569, or just under a quarter,
were Protestant in 1831.[34 ] What turned this steady stream of immi-
grants into a flood was, of course, the Irish famine of the mid-1840s.
By 1848 an average of 1000 Irish migrants were arriving every week
in Glasgow, and as a result of this explosive diaspora Scotland's Irish-
born population increased by 90 per cent in the decade 1841-51. [35 ]
Compared to only 2.9 per cent for England and Wales, the Irish-born
portion of the population of Scotland had reached 7.2 per cent at its
peak. [36 ]
The growth of mining, handloom weaving and transport was an
attraction to the Irish, and by the late 1830s over 30 per cent of
handloom weavers were Irish-hornY Although most of them were of

37


-----

Catholic origin, there is evidence that the Protestant Irish had estab-
lished themselves in the spinning and weaving factories of the
Calton-Mile End area of Glasgow and in Blantyre in Lanarkshire. [38 ]
As an employer agriculture was also important to the Irish. A total
of 16.5 per cent of the population of rural Wigtownshire in 1841
was Irish-born, and there was a sizeable Irish community established
in Dumfrieshire by this date. [39 ] Thus, settling in an area was related
to the occupational structure. Aberdeen had only 1.8 per cent of its
population Irish-born in 1851, whereas its near neighbour, Dundee,
with its vibrant textile industry, had over 20 per cent. [40 ] Nearly half
the female textile workers in Greenock in 1851 were Irish-born; and
half the coal and ironstone miners of Coatbridge were of the same
origin. Indeed, by mid-century over a third of the population of Coat-
bridge was Irish-born. [41 ] Although most Irish workers were employed
in unskilled, low paid occupations, there is evidence to suggest that
some were able to penetrate into skilled occupations. A study of the
marriage register in St Patrick's RC Church, Anderston, Glasgow,
shows that of 146 Catholic males engaged in metals, machines and
shipbuilding, excluding labourers, 28.1 per cent were low paid ham-
mermen and 10.4 per cent were riveters; however, 16 per cent of the
total described themselves as boilermakers and 9. 7 per cent were
moulders. [42 ] This does not alter the fact that the majority of Catholic
Irish workers were in unskilled jobs, but it would appear at this stage
that religious persuasion was not the barrier to a trade that it became
later in the century. However, the scramble for jobs and living space
created tensions both within and without the Irish community. By
1835 there were twelve Orange Lodges in Glasgow and in the follow-
ing year they provided the platform for the launch of the 'Tory and
Presbyterian' Glasgow Operative Conservative Society (1836-42).[43 ]
Priests and ministers reported on the open friction and social distance
between the two communities in places such as Glasgow, Greenock,
Paisley and Kilmarnock. [44 ]
The overcrowding and squalor which resulted from the mass
influx of migrants turned cities like Glasgow into the nearest suburbs
to hell. The chief constable of Glasgow, Captain Miller, remarked at
a meeting of the British Association in 1840 that in 'the very centre
of the city there is an accumulated mass of squalid wretchedness
which is probably unequalled in any town of the British dominions'. [45 ]
The death rate in urban areas increased dramatically as disease took
its toll on the squalid and impoverished town dwellers. Glasgow's
mortality rate was the highest in the country, peaking at 39.9 per

38

1000 between 1845 and 1849. [46 ] Even Edinburgh with its small man-
ufacturing and service-based economy saw its death rate increase
from 25 per 1000 in 1810-19 to 29 per 1000 in the decade 1831-39.
Fever mortality levels were higher in the capital than in the worst
English townY

Much of the poverty arose from the presence of a large reserve
army of labour which led to work being scarce or irregular. However,
wages for most workers, even skilled, were lower in Scotland than
south of the border; a result of the numbers crowding into trades
rather than deskilling. Building workers earned somewhere between
15 and 25 per cent less than their equivalents in England.[48 ] Ian Levitt
and Christopher Smout, in their study of poor law returns in 1843,
confirm that, in spite of regional and occupational variations, Scotland
was a low wage economy. The average weekly wage for Scottish
stonemasons in 1843 was 15.63s, with colliers receiving 15.51s and
millwrights 14.0s respectively. Moreover, earnings were also subject
to fluctuation as in the economic depression of 1848 colliers' wages
fell to a nadir of 1 Os per week, and even in better times a shilling
deduction was made for tools, lights and powder which brought
their wages down; while woollen weavers in the southern counties of
Scotland saw their wages fall from 15-18s per week in the early
1830s to only lOs 4d in 1849.[49 ] Those male workers in the lowest
categories of employment were estimated to earn an average of 5. 79s
a week, or around a third of the skilled wage. Thus, although it was
claimed at the time that 'decent work people ... [in Glasgow] have
generally a tolerably furnished house ... a carpet, a mahogany chest
of drawers ... good blankets and bedding' ,[50 ] a survey of average real
wages in nineteen occupational groups showed that during the first
phase of industrialisation many Glasgow workers in employment
experienced a decline or stagnation in their standard of living, with
the unskilled being worse off in 1830 than they had been in 1790.[51 ]
Even skilled workers experienced a fall in their real wages of over 30
per cent between 1815 and 1840.[52 ]

##### 'ROUGH AND RESPECTABLE': THE CULTURE OF THE SCOTTISH
 WORKING CLASSES, 1800-1850

The inequalities in the distribution of rewards inevitably impacted
themselves on the lifestyles and culture of Scottish workers, but tra-
ditional notions of status were also important in this respect.
Weavers, in spite of declining wages, saw themselves as superior to
spinners, and even as late as the 1890s in Bridgeton in Glasgow there
was 'little social intercourse between the two'. [53 ] However, as James
Myles, author of several studies of working-class life in Dundee,
observed, there were also gradations of status among domestic and
factory weavers, with the former being:

Mostly Scotchmen advanced in years, who work in their own
homes, and who have a fair share of intelligence and education,
and ... maintain a more decent exterior than the latter class.
Their wages are not higher than the factory weavers; yet as their
families are mainly up, their burdens are not so oppressive. The
majority of factory weavers are Irishmen and young Scotchmen,
sons of poor house weavers. [54 ]

The social distance between handloom weavers and spinners and
factory weavers was a legacy of the golden age of handloom weaving
and the ethnic divisions within the industry. The Irish, lacking the
skills to do complicated or fancy weaving, tended to crowd into the
spinning sector or factory weaving, as occurred in Paisley and
Dundee, and divisions based on skill were overlain by cultural and
religious divides. [55 ] The high wages earned by weavers in the early

1800s also allowed them a more than tolerable degree of comfort.
It was said that the best paid weavers 'had libraries equal to those of

40

_Culture of the Scottish Working Classes_

ministers or professional men'. [56 ] Indeed, according to James Orr, him-
self a weaver, handloom weavers:

to a great extent built their own houses, partly by their own
savings and partly on borrowed money; they were careful to
educate their children and they never contracted a bad marriage
until they had saved up the means of beginning to keep house. 5 [7 ]

Although poverty and the influx of illiterate Irish peasants drove
down the educational standards among the children of handloom
weavers, in the east of Scotland weavers retained their book clubs
and attended lectures. [58 ] In contrast, the spinners with their Irish
connections were invariably presented in contemporary literature
as 'uneducated, violent and drunken'. James Myles summed up
Presbyterian Scotland's view of the Irish when he wrote that:

It is deeply to be lamented that the vast hordes who have
migrated to the Scouring burn [Dundee] are composed of the
most debased and ignorant of their countrymen. Their vile slang
and immoral habits have seriously injured the general character
of the poor population of Dundee, and I believe throughout
Scotland. The low Irish are not a very improvable race. They cling
to their rags, their faith and their filth with all the besottedness
of perfect ignorance and stupidity. The customs now prevalent
amongst the poorer classes on Sundays of standing in their
every-day clothes in groups in the street - sitting outside stairs,
and smoking ... tippling of counters, and swearing ... are all
derived from the examples of the vulgar Irish, who within the
last fifty years have ... deluged all the manufacturing towns of
modern civilization. [59 ]

But ethnic stereotyping of the Irish by the Scots was duplicated in
English attitudes to Scottish workers in the coal and iron industries.
Rob Duncan's study of the iron and coal industries of Monklands
shows that workers from South Wales and Staffordshire saw them-
selves as superior to the Scots in these industries, and because of this
'generally distanced themselves' from the indigenous population. [60 ]

Differences were also observed in other trades. Hugh Miller
regarded tailors in Edinburgh with their fashionable clothes and
'grotesque' manners as the most ridiculous and affected of mechanics;
whereas in the complementary trade of shoemaking, the artisans

41


-----

were said to be 'intelligent' and 'manly', although over-fond of St
Monday. [61 ] In Glasgow, letterpress printers were reckoned to be 'the
most intelligent' of the artisanate 'and ... very well behaved', while
outworkers such as tailors and shoemakers were considered 'very
irregular in attending to their work and in their habits of living'. [62 ]
Independence was a feature of the character of smiths and stonema-
sons; the latter were said by Miller to 'rarely touch [their] hat[s] to a
gentleman'. [63 ] Colliers too had an inherent sense of independence,
'which the cringing slaves in other trades envied but could not
match'. [64 ] In 1842 a Lothian coalowner stated before the Children's
Employment Commission that: 'I have no control whatever over the
colliers in my employment ... [they] go to their work at whatever
hour of the night or day they think proper and work just as long as
they choose'. [65 ]
The occupational culture of the skilled trades was a hierarchical
one that was mirrored in their treatment of those below them. The
unskilled and female workers were viewed as socially inferior by
artisans and a kind of workplace and social system of apartheid kept
these groups apart. Alexander Somerville, general labourer, remarked,
in his autobiography, that 'masons were intolerable tyrants to their
labourers' and were allowed to beat and intimidate them, and when
he complained about this he was informed that 'it was against the
laws of their body to hear their privileges discussed by a labourer'.
A labourer in a coppersmith's shop in Glasgow underscored
Somerville's claim, remarking that 'in all large shops ... the labourer
is the servant of every journeyman in the place ... [and] to lord it
over the labourers is the rule'. [66 ] Things were no better for women.
As the eighteenth century wore on they found themselves increasingly
reduced to the role of performing ancillary or support work to that
of men and that reflected in their declining social status and wages. [67 ]

One of the foundation stones of the exclusiveness of artisanal cul-
ture _vis-a-vis_ other groups was literacy. Although Scotland had a
superior level of literacy to that of England, it was clear that many
workers were excluded from the ranks of the skilled trades on the
grounds of illiteracy. According to the 1834 Factory Act, 96 per cent
of male mill workers could read, but only 58 per cent could write,
compared to 86 and 43 per cent respectively in England. A more
detailed study of the Grandholm Linen Works, Aberdeen, showed
that of 1119 workers employed at the mill, 28 per cent could both read
and write, 45 per cent could only read and 27 per cent were illiterate.
The Children's Employment Commission of 1842-43 reported that

42


-----

_Culture_ _the Scottish Working Classes_

the children of miners left school at the age of nine years, if they went
at all. A wider study of 3836 children and young persons found that
'not a couple of dozen could be found to write a dozen consecutive
lines on any given subject capable of being read and understood'. [68 ]
In contrast, the necessity to read plans and execute written orders
called on a high order of literacy skills, all of which underscored the
self-improving aspirations of the artisanal elite. Mechanics Institutes,
debating clubs, literary and scientific societies, and other self-help
institutions had a substantial artisanal membership. Total Abstinence
Societies (TAS) flourished in lowland Scotland in the 1830s and
1840s and most Chartists were members of temperance organisations;
indeed, Aberdeen TAS had 3000 members, which was made up
'almost entirely' of Chartists and other radicals, and a favourite song
at Chartist gatherings was Neil Gow's 'Farewell to Whisky'. [69 ]
However, parallelling this world of self-improvement was a rougher
culture based on drink and linked to other forms of amusement,
which in the pre-industrial period focused on blood sports, such as
cock fighting which drew large audiences, as did bare-fisted fighting.
Traditional football games tended towards violence and riot as sides
were seemingly unlimited in terms of the number of players involved
and were not subject to time limits, going on until the players were
exhausted or bored. But as industrial change brought the need for a
more disciplined labour force in the workshops and factories, and
the movement of people away from rural areas to the towns and
cities deprived them of space, popular community games of the
pre-industrial order were increasingly outlawed or subject to greater
regulation. As early as 1814, a ranger was appointed in Glasgow to
keep ball games off Glasgow Green and to disperse crowds of noisy
young people. [70 ]

Public order concerns and restricted space drove the unrespectable
indoors. Penny theatres became highly popular with the working
classes, in spite of the opprobrium showered on them by the
respectable middle classes. In Glasgow, the Saltmarket/jail Square
area abounded with these establishments offering cheap entertainment
and alcohol. According to one minister, penny theatres were by-words
for drunkenness, prostitution and every other vice imaginable. They
were also very unsafe and the last major one- Anderson's City
###### Theatre- burned down in 1848. Supplementing the penny theatres
was the annual fair, another event subjected to religious condemna-
tion. The Glasgow, or St Mungo's, Fair had been established in the
fifteenth century as a religious celebration; however, during the first

43


-----

half of the nineteenth century it was 'reduced to a day or two cele-
brated in blind drunkenness', attracting showmen, circuses, and freak
shows from all over Britain. [71 ]
Thus, the disorder and violence of the 'rough culture' continued to
persist into the 1830s and 1840s. Part of the problem was the easy
access to drink. The replacement of porter and stout by whisky pro-
vided a cheap route to oblivion and Scots applied themselves with
dedication. Most of the drinking was done in licensed premises and
they proliferated with remarkable speed throughout Scotland. Edin-
burgh in the 1840s, according to Hamish Fraser, had one pub per 30
families; Dundee had one for every 24 families; and Glasgow one for
every 150 inhabitants.7[2 ] Therefore, the idea of a pub on every street
corner was more than just an alcoholic's fantasy. Young and old,
men and women, all enjoyed a tipple, sometimes with devastating
effects. A journeyman baker, who worked in an alehouse for a short
period, spoke of the 'fearful ... scenes [he] witnessed', saying:

Many weeping mothers ... came to the house pleading with their
darling sons to come home; wives pleading with their husbands
not to destroy their whole families by spending their earnings on
drink. ... I have seen children leading home their drunken
mothers and I have also seen companies of children come to the
house and call for drink themselves. [73 ]

Age was no barrier to drink and with drunkeness came wife-beating.
Anna Clark's work on domestic violence in Glasgow in the first half
of the nineteenth century shows that it was directly linked to alcohol
consumption and that it cut across all strata of the working class. Of
men convicted of wife-beating in the period 1813-24 over one-third
were skilled workers, and that figure was maintained into the 1830s.7[4 ]
However, in spite of repeated condemnation by the middle classes,
little could be done to remedy the situation. Alcohol was woven
into the social fabric of the workplace and the wider society. It was
crucially important at life cycle events such as births and deaths, but
it was used also during a boy's apprenticeship to mark the various
stages in his progression to skilled man. John Dunlop, temperance
reformer, chronicled the drinking customs and habits among the
Scottish workers at this time. Among plumbers, when the apprentice
cast his first sheet of lead, he was expected to 'treat' his workmates
to a drink; when a block-cutter cut his first printing block he was
bound to pay 20s for the purpose of treating his fellow workers with

44


-----

_Culture of the Scottish Working Classes_

drink.7[5 ] In the shipbuilding yards apprentices had to pay £2 entry
money which was stored up until enough was accumulated to pay
for a night out. [76 ] Hugh Miller said of the masons of the Cromarty
Firth area that they were treated to a drink when an apprentice
joined the squad; treated to a drink when his 'apron was washed';
and treated to a drink when his 'time was out' .7[7 ] Even in occupations
not normally afforded the accolade of being skilled similar practices
could be found. In cotton spinning, new hands coming in, or a spinner
getting his wheels, all involved a celebratory drink.7[8 ]

The moralising of Dunlop and Miller concerning drink in the
workplace blinded them to the role it played in structuring social
relationships. Firstly, few workers could avoid an association with a
public house since, as Dunlop himself recognised, 'most work-people
are either paid in public houses, or receive pound notes and [are
forced] ... to go to the public house for change and division of the
money'. [79 ] Secondly, the charging of entry fees to apprentices was not
simply a means of financing debauchery, but also of regulating the
supply of labour. The print workers of Scotland charged an entry fee
of £7 which even Dunlop in his more lucid moments could see acted
as a 'check on the reception of apprentices, and kept up a monopoly
of hands'. [80 ] Alexander Somerville found that sawyers in Edinburgh
would not work with him until 'a certain quantity of whisky' was
supplied. Only after that was he 'initiate[d] into the mysteries of
brotherhood' and was able 'to secure the good will of the whole
body'. [81 ] The rituals associated with the drinking customs thus
emphasised the closed nature of the group. Finally, employers plied
their workers with drink at strategic times of the year or at the
completion of a certain workload. Drinking in this context had the
effect of symbolising the hierarchical relations of production, and in
a period of political upheaval it could also be used to build under-
standings between management and workers. During the 'Radical
Rising' of 1820, the employees in the Glasgow printfields were
thanked by the manager for their lack of involvement who 'after-
wards entertained them with a case of Highland whisky'. [82 ] But the
impact was ambiguous as alcohol could at the same time symbolise
the independence of labour from capital. Thomas Stewart, the
Larkhall collier poet of the 1840s, recalled how, on the slightest
pretext, the colliers would decide to retire to the pithead for a 'social
glass'; and the practice of St Monday was common among workers
in Scotland. James Myles bemoaned the habit of power loom weavers
in Dundee spending 'Saturday, Sunday and Monday ... indulging
their passion for whisky'. 83

45


-----

Another elemental part of the skilled worker's ethos was indepen-
dence, which, in part derived from the relative autonomy they
enjoyed in the workplace, but also found part of its origin in Scottish
Presbyterianism. The Protestant notion of everyman his own priest,
and the stress placed on literacy by the Church as the means of
reaching God, inculcated a sense of self-esteem in Scottish workers
captured in Robert Burn's line 'a man's a man for a' that'. Although
it was estimated that two-thirds of the slum-dwelling unskilled
workers of Glasgow and one-third of the population of Edinburgh
rarely attended a recognised place of worship, [84 ] and contemporaries
despaired that 'upwards of a HUNDRED THOUSAND HUMAN
BEINGS are to be found in Lanarkshire ... unprovided with any
accommodation in any place of worship', [85 ] the work of Callum
Brown and Peter Hillis on church attendance and membership shows
that skilled workers predominated in the congregations of many
Presbyterian churches. [86 ] Proof of how important religion was to
skilled workers can be seen in the way the whole debate over the
future of the Church of Scotland in the early 1840s distracted a great
many artisans from radical politics. Even among those who were
outside the reach of the Church, religion was used as a form of mea-
suring status and policing the boundaries of the labour market.
Indigenous Protestant hatred of Catholicism ensured a large measure
of hostility to Irish immigrants throughout Scotland, and confined
Catholics for generations to come to unskilled, low paid work.
Plebeian culture in the first half of the nineteenth century already
prefigured the division of the working class into the respectable and
unrespectable. However, acquiring the status of respectability was
derived not simply from lifestyle, but also from occupation and the
degree to which one exercised control over the terms and conditions
of one's employment. The long hours, low wages and recurring
unemployment precluded the poor from respectable working-class
pursuits and pushed them in the direction of the shebeens, brothels
and penny theatres. Textile workers in Lanarkshire were condemned
by Sheriff Archibald Alison for their immorality as 'cohabitation,
private marriages and bigamy were extremely common'. [87 ] Thus, the
workplace is central to understanding working-class culture in this
period in as much as it conditioned the form and determined the
access.

##### TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AND
 WORKPLACE STRUGGLES,

#### 1800-1850

The lower wages earned by Scottish employees were not compensated
by a less authoritarian and harsh working regime. However, the
sternness of the regime was tempered by the degree of skill involved
in the occupation. Not all trades were to undergo profound trans-
formation in this period, but all were drawn into regional and inter-
national markets, and because of this were open to the influences of
the trade cycle. Although one might expect that the most far-reaching
changes in technology and work organisation were to be found in
the those occupations associated with industrialisation, this was not
necessarily the case as an examination of certain industrial occupa-
tions will show.
The major change taking place in the cotton industry in Scotland
at this time was the mechanisation of spinning and the growth of
factory production. However, the development of the steam-powered
mule did not result in the diminution of skill and neither did it
increase the employers' control of the labour process, although it did
much to marginalise the role of female spinners and downgrade most
of them to ancillary or supplementary work, such as piecing. Cotton
spinners in Glasgow were able to establish an informal system of
apprenticeship by which young boys entering the mill at the age of
nine were trained gradually until the age of seventeen when they
qualified as spinners. As most of them were the sons or relatives of
existing spinners, the adult male workers were able to control and
regulate the supply of labour. The physical demands of mule spinning
put the occupation beyond female labour. Women, on the whole,
were confined to the lighter task of throstle spinning or ancillary
tasks in the mill mainly in water-powered mills in the country. [88 ]

###### 47


-----

Attempts to alter the balance of power in the factory by the invention
of a machine 'which would dispense with the labour of the spinner'
by rendering the mule 'self-acting' did not get very far. [89 ] Although it
offered the possibility of automating many of the spinner's tasks,
self-acting machines were never adopted on a large scale until the
1850s. Wage cutting by employers retarded 'the introduction of the
self-acting mules for some time' ,9° as they began coupling existing
mules together and, in the process, doubling the productivity of the
spinner. [91 ] In spite of the fact that the spinners were defeated in the
1837 strike over this issue, their defeat did not encourage employers
to employ more female labour on spinning machines as long as the
mule was favoured over the self-actor. There were only 70 female
mulespinners in Glasgow out of a total of 1000 in that year. [92 ]
Advances in technology, therefore, increased the power of the male
cotton spinner, and employers retaliated by tightening up industrial
discipline. The motivation for factory production over the domestic
system had, as Landes points out, been to increase the control of the
employer over the workforce: 'Factory equalled discipline cum super-
vision' .[93 ] During the 1820s there were numerous strikes in the cotton
industry over the question of discipline. A strike at the Broadford
Mill in Aberdeen saw David Thompson of the Weavers' Union accuse
the managers of becoming 'aristocratical and grasping', of exercising
'their generosity only when they have satisfied their own rapacity'.
The West of Scotland Female Power Loom Weavers' Association was
set up partly to combat the 'tyranny of the overseers' in the Glasgow
cotton industry. [94 ] Generally, the target of the workers' action was
'too zealous managers' and the protests were aimed at the excessive
use of fining workers for breaches of managerial designed codes of
working. [95 ] In Glasgow, the employers formed an association in 1823
to combat striking spinners challenging managerial control of the
labour process. [96 ] Weavers too were subjected to tighter discipline.
The issue of embezzlement of webs had demented employers from
the late eighteenth century and in the 1820s it was still going on with
52 Glasgow companies and individuals reporting 'very serious losses'.
The employers set up a 'Detecting Society', the managers of which
'scoured Glasgow in a search for weavers who took webs but did not
work them' .[97 ]
###### If the tensions in the spinning mills and the weaving sector emerged
over the questions of control and discipline, in the skilled trades the
issues tended to be connected with specialisation. Shoe-making
underwent a complete reorganisation of the division of labour. James

_Technological Change and Workplace Struggles_

Myles, in his fictional autobiography, stated that he obtained employ-
ment in Dundee in 1835 as a 'woman's man', that is, 'an operative
who confines himself to the making of women's shoes'. [98 ] Further
sub-division of tasks by 1850 led to the cutting out of leather and
sewing together the uppers ('closing') as separate operations. [99 ] In the
engineering trade a similar and more extensive process occurred. The
millwright's craft was broken up into a series of sub-divided tasks each
requiring a separate worker to perform them. Planers, fitters, turners,
borers, and so on, were employed to carry out a portion of the
millwright's craft. [100 ] In the building industry there was also a drive
towards specialisation of labour. The trade of carpenter and joiner,
and that of plumber/glazier/painter, was broken down into its con-
stituent parts. [101 ] Finally, in the coal industry massive expansion took
place in the 1830s and 1840s following the boom in iron production.
Large integrated coal and iron consortiums such as Bairds in Lanark-
shire developed as a result. Many former independent coal workers
and newly arrived immigrants from Ireland were forced into waged
labour for these giant firms. The independence of the Scots' colliers
clashed with the more supine attitude of the Irish and the trade
became divided between 'honourable men' and 'degraded slaves' .[102 ]
Although there was little the majority of employers could do to
control the labour process underground, the larger coal and iron
combines in Lanarkshire were able to introduce an early version of
the longwall method of coal-getting which reduced their dependency
on skilled colliers, as well as intensifying industrial discipline through
a mixture of mechanisms, including fines for absenteeism and closer
supervision. [103 ]
Another means of ensuring application from the miners open to
the coalowners was altering the sexual division of labour. According
to the report of the 1842 Commissioners on the mining industry in the
east of Scotland there were 338 women for every 1000 men. These
women were mainly employed to transport coal from the pit face to
the bottom of the shaft, although some of them worked above ground.
Most of the women were directly related to the colliers either as
wives or daughters and were employed directly by them. The question
of inducing greater responsibility among miners towards their work
regime forced employers to the conclusion that by making them
responsible for family maintenance, by prohibiting the labour of
women and children underground, they could bring about a change
in attitude. After prohibition was legalised in 1842, evidence, accord-
ing to Jane Humphries, from pits where women had been excluded

49


-----

suggests that the policy had a 'steadying impact on male labour'. [104 ]
According to the Commissioners, 'in the Duke of Buccleugh's mines

[the exclusion of women and children meant that] the colliers are
much more regular in the their labour than heretofore'. [105 ]
However, the intensification of the division of labour, or altering
its sexual composition as in the case of the coal industry, did not
necessarily end on-the-job control and because of this a certain auton-
omy continued to be enjoyed by many skilled workers. Edinburgh
stonemasons, for example, let their hammers fall without striking if
time was called as an assertion of their right to control their own
pace of work. [106 ] This applied also in coalmining, in spite of the
stricter imposition of industrial discipline noted above. The 'pillar
and stoop' method of coal-getting used in most pits made underground
supervision almost impossible as colliers were spread out over a large
area. This left them with a degree of responsible autonomy unknown
to most industrial workers, at least in the smaller pits. [107 ] However,
the changes which had taken place in Scottish industry generally
ensured that no one trade was capable of controlling the labour
process in the way that, say, the millwright had been able to do in
engineering and the shipwright in shipbuilding. Thus employers to
a certain extent were able to break down craft privileges which
allowed them greater freedom to adjust wages to prevailing market
conditions. This placed the skilled workers in a more insecure position
than previously and also put them at the mercy of the trade cycle.
These uncertainties also struck at artisanal notions of the historic
interests of the working community of brothers at the trade.
The long period of training of between five to seven years and
work experience required in most trades meant that, according to
artisanal logic, a form of property had been acquired embedded in
their skill, one of whose characteristics was that it was inheritable. As
one foreman carpenter put it when asked by a Commons' committee
whether limiting apprentices was 'beneficial to the trade':

I think it rather beneficial, as the trade is at present quite over-
stocked and in order to give my brother carpenters an opportu-
nity of rearing up our children, our brothers, or nephews in this
trade if we please. We consider that an employer, not a carpenter,
has no right to take seven or eight apprentices to learn the
trade ... to the exclusion of our children or our brothers. [108 ]

Thus, the practice of sons following fathers into a trade as their

50


-----

'birthright' had a functional dimension to it as well as an ideological
one. Patrimony ensured the transmission of certain customary practices
concerning such important issues as workloads and wage differentials.
But as trades expanded in the course of the first half of the nineteenth
century this personal form of socialisation could not be guaranteed,
and neither could a trade be restricted exclusively to sons and rela-
tives. As regulation broke down, it was increasingly the ownership of
tools which symbolised the collective or social ownership of skill.
As Eric Hobsbawm points out this not only advertised the 'relative
independence of the artisan from management, but, even more clearly,
his monopoly of skilled work'. [109 ] In the building trade, for example,
bricklayers' labourers were not allowed to use the trowel. [110 ]
Changes in the workplace, therefore, had a contradictory effect on
skill; however, all craftsmen were subject to greater competition from
'half bred men' and suffered from the vicissitudes of the economic
cycle. During the eighteenth century the journeymen could expect
some form of relief from the courts in regard to wages and working
conditions. However, as Hamish Fraser points out, from certainly
1813 onwards this was no longer assured. Judicial interference in the
market for labour was increasingly viewed by a manufacturing class,
raised on the _laissez-faire_ doctrines of Adam Smith, and by their
sympathisers on the bench as 'impracticable' .[111 ] Without the protec-
tion of the JPs workers had little choice but to come together and
unite to form associations for the redress of grievances.

##### CLASS STRUGGLE AND THE GROWTH OF TRADE UNIONS
 IN SCOTLAND, 1800-1850

As we have seen, the pressures emanating from the first phase of
industrialisation increasingly meant that the agent of socialisation
and defence of trade practices lay with the trade unions or unofficial
workshop committees. Although associations of workers existed in
pre-industrial times and engaged in industrial struggle, they were
mainly benefit societies, or 'coffin clubs', rather than trade unions in
the modern sense of the word. The early unions, however, were
small, local, based mainly on skilled workers, and concerned with
limiting the supply of labour and controlling the labour process.
They operated around the notion of the trade as a community of
interests and defended these interests against strangers, females and
'dishonourable' employers. The rules of the Edinburgh Society of
Bookbinders were typical in as much as they allowed that 'all book-
binders, whether masters or journeymen ... may choose to join us' . [112 ]
However, with the expansion of the economy and the changes in
the labour process the unions became more class orientated. The
Edinburgh journeymen bookbinders by 1822 had a change in the rules
which stated that 'when any member commences business, he must
immediately leave the society; and if any employer, who has taken
leave of the society, shall again become a journeyman, he shall be
admitted free of expense ... after he begins to work as a journey-
man'.113
In pursuit of their goals the early unions adopted a form of organi-
sation which was dualistic. The modern aspects of trade unionism,
that is, visible leaders, conferences, branches and membership cards,
competed with the pre-industrial ones, based on secrecy, rituals and
signs, and violence. The Associated Colliers of Scotland had an

52

initiating ceremony and an oath which bound them not to reveal the
collier's password. The word 'Balaam' was derived from the biblical
verse 'and the angel said unto Balaam, Go with the men, but only the
word I shall speak unto thee, that thou shall speak' . [114 ] Among the
Scottish blacksmiths there were 'courts of justice' in which 'he who
presides wears a quantity of tow ... around his head, in imitation of
a wig, and is styled the Lord Justice Clerk. The decisions of these
judges are final: and such as do not comply with them, are compelled
by persecution to leave the shop'. [115 ] The United Joiners of Glasgow
had to call an emergency committee meeting in January 1837 when
it was reported that 'a baker had become acquainted with the
_Pas sword of the English order' ._ [116 ] These passwords, rituals and signs
were, therefore, fairly endemic in the trade unions of this time and
owe something to the influence of freemasonry. In spite of their
antiquated nature, they served an important function in impressing
upon new members the seriousness of their undertaking, and were
useful in building a collective identity and interests in the trade.
Acts of violence also had a part to play in the enforcement of union
strategy. Ear cropping was occasionally used in mining areas to deal
with blacklegs; arson, intimidation and murder occurred in the cotton
industry. In 1819/20 the introduction of female spinners at the
Broomward Mill in Glasgow led the men to burn the mill down. One
woman was shot amid the mayhem. Similarly in 1832 women spinners
were blinded by vitriol, and five years before this a new worker at
the Adelphi Mill was shot dead while sleeping. [117 ]
In spite of these pre-industrial forms of protest, a more visibly
modern form of organisational structure was beginning to evolve
among the unions. The Glasgow cotton spinners' association, which
relied on violence to maintain discipline among the membership, had
a democratic structure which stretched from the factory floor to the
executive committee. Elected delegates determined membership of the
governing body of twelve members, collected dues and issued mem-
bership cards. A supply committee arranged credit for strikers and
organised the distribution of food; a finance committee raised money
and distributed strike pay; and a guard committee took charge of
picketing. On top of this the union also paid unemployment and
funeral benefit. [11] 8
In keeping with the spirit of modernisation and in response to the
formation of associations of employers, there evolved an appreciation
among workers of the need to form national or, at least, larger trade
unions, in spite of the fact that few succeeded for any length of time.

In this the cotton spinners and weavers showed an early awareness.
A general weavers' association was formed in 1812 when employers
attempted to dismantle piece rate structures; and the strength of the
spinners' union was so formidable that the employers formed an
association of their own in 1810 to free themselves of the influence
of 'Third Parties' combined for 'the sinistrous and illegal purpose of
controlling the trade at large' .[119 ] Other trades experiencing expansion
and change adopted the strategy of the cotton workers. In 1817 the
Glasgow and Ayr Miners' Associations merged in order to 'regulate
the market for coal and labour', although the arrest of its leaders
shortly after this led to collapse. [120 ] Eight years later the Lanarkshire
miners formed the Associated Colliers of Scotland, although like its
predecessor it was defeated by a counter offensive by the employers
shortly after its formation. [121 ] However, a national union - the General
Union of Operative Colliers- resurfaced. Again it was defeated by
the ironmasters through the use of blackleg labour and evictions. [122 ]
In the building trade in 1832 a Scottish National Joiners' Association
was initiated by the Glasgow and Greenock joiners. [123 ]
More impressive than these attempts to establish occupational
trade unions was the formation of the Glasgow United Committee of
Trades Delegates formed in early 1830 to push for the Reform Bill.
After 1832 it met sporadically; however, interestingly it was revived
in 1837 to support the Glasgow cotton spinners in their strike. In
Edinburgh, organisation was on a more ad hoc basis but 'trades dele-
gates' organised a protest against the sentences of the Tolpuddle
Martyrs in 1834, and in 1835 opposed parliamentary grants to the
Church of Scotland. [124 ] However, the most formidable expression of
solidarity among the labouring classes was the support given to Robert
Owen's Grand National Consolidated Trades Union (GNCTU).
Although its main support was based in London, branches of Owen's
organisation were said to have existed all over Scotland; however,
the strongest centres were Glasgow and Paisley. The experience of
the branch formed in Aberdeen was fairly typical. The branch was
set up in the early part of 1834 and drew on the support of a wide
range of trades, but with the collapse of the GNTCU in mid-summer
of that year, it rapidly went into terminal decline. However, in
Glasgow the Consolidated Union maintained a presence, thanks to
the efforts of Alexander Campbell, until the end of the 1830s. [125 ]
Trade unionism in general in Scotland received a crushing blow
in 1837 with the failure of the Glasgow cotton spinners' strike. The
spinners were the best organised workers in the west of Scotland. By

_Class Struggle and Growth_ _Trade Unions_

adopting the primary craft principle of limiting the supply of labour
through refusing to teach persons who were not 'sons or brothers of
a spinner', the spinners had virtually established a closed shop in the
Glasgow mills. It was estimated by one working spinner that out of
a total of 1000 spinners in Glasgow in 1837, 850-900 were members
of the union. [126 ] So effective was the union's control of the spinning
sector that the first factory inspector for Scotland was moved to
remark: 'the operatives have so completely organised their association,
as not only to prescribe the wages to be paid to members of the asso-
ciation, but to all other persons, from whatever quarter they come' .[127 ]
In the course of events, however, the employers' association proved
stronger. Not only were the spinners defeated, but the identification
of the strike with the worst excesses of violence led to the trial and
transportation of their leaders. [128 ] Defeat ensured that the Glasgow
Association lost much of its power in the workplace and its ability to
control the labour supply, but the capacity for collective organisation
remained intact, that is, if measured by its means to wage industrial
warfare. Further strikes occurred in 1844. [129 ] However, the bad pub-
licity the trade union movement received as a result of the violent
tactics of the spinners' association, and the failure of the Lanarkshire
miners to defend their ability to restrict output in the same year,
despite being out on strike for four months, [130 ] further weakened
Scottish trade unionism and it took many decades before it recovered.
The economic depressions of 1838-42 delivered the final blow to
the remnants of worker organisation north of the border. National
unions among spinners and miners broke up and the locality became
the dominant locus of organisation. During the 1842 miners' strike,
Rob Duncan shows that there was little effort made to link up the
struggles of the miners in Monklands with those in Ayrshire, the
Lothians, Fife and Stirlingshire and Clackmannanshire. [131 ] Moreover,
the association of industrial conflict with alcoholic excess led Scottish
unions to meet in coffee houses as part of a new search for
'respectability' .[132 ] Even the Glasgow cotton spinners' rule book in
1838 stated that its executive committee 'must take a room not
connected with a public house' .[133 ] However, in the immediate term,
the demise of trade unionism after the spinners' strike of 1837 and
the onset of economic depression led workers back in the direction
of politics as they had done during the years 1815-20.

##### NATION v. CLASS: RADICAL STRUGGLES IN SCOTLAND, 1800-1850

The pillars of the political culture of the Scottish workers in the
period from the 1790s to the Chartist movement of the late 1830s
and early 1840s were democracy and social justice, which, in turn,
rested on a value system which derived its strength from independence,
temperance and religion. As we have seen, the first was the product
of workplace notions regarding skill and status; the other two
enhanced this by emphasising the respectability and social worth of
the worker. As with trade unionism, worker politics in Scotland were
dominated by the concerns and ideology of skilled, predominantly
male, Protestant workers. Women, in spite of the fact that they
played an active part in political reform movements throughout this
period, found themselves increasingly excluded from the public
sphere as even Chartists championed the ideal of domesticity for
their wives in return for the badge of citizenship. This social ethos
combined with the political principles to which skilled workers sub-
scribed in this period were by no means exclusive. They were shared
by other groups in Scottish society, particularly the petty bourgeoisie.
This shared ethos, which drew its inspiration and strength from the
Scottish Enlightenment, made class alliances possible and, indeed,
were a noted feature of political development in this period. However,
it has to be stressed that the interpretation of these principles was
open to negotiation and re-negotiation. Thus, the meanings and
understandings attached to them were never static and never univer-
sal, and because of this they were capable of being moulded to suit
the aspirations and interests of any one social grouping. Moreover,
the cross-class ethos was fragile, particularly when threatened by the
volatile culture of the unskilled and ethnic communities, as well as

56

from declining occupations such as handloom weavers. The fragmen-
tation of the working class along ethnic, material, status and sectarian
lines also invited a number of contrasting and alternative responses
to the pressures thrown up by industrial and urban development in
this period.
The engagement of the workers with the political system came in
the various radical attempts to alter the character of the British state
dating from the 1780s. The radical critique of politics based itself on
the distinction made between the parasitic landowning class, which
ran the state in its own interests through a corrupt and venal elec-
toral system, and the politically powerless, but useful and productive
masses. Thus, the workers and middle classes as the 'useful' masses
were to be united through radical leadership in an attempt to restruc-
ture the basis of the unreformed state by gaining the franchise. The
first serious challenge in the 1790s by this alliance of the 'rough and
refined' to the state ended in failure. The governing classes were able
to paralyse the reformers by labelling them unpatriotic and pro-
French. Lord Cockburn brought out the essential weakness of the
radicals when he said:

The chief object at which our discontented aimed was parlia-
mentary reform. But this and other home-bred ends were hid by
a cloud of foreign follies, which the Tories exhibited as demon-
strations that the correction of domestic abuses was a pretence,
and Jacobinism the truth. On this foundation they represented
the whole lower orders as hostile to our institutions; from which
the desired and comfortable inference was, that there was no
salvation for the country except in the predominance of their
own party. [134 ]

The cry of 'King and country' proved more capable of mobilising the
masses than the democratic shibboleths of political radicalism in this
period. State repression forced the radical movement underground in
the early 1800s and it took the economic depression after the defeat
of Napoleon to kickstart the reform movement into political life.
This new phase of radicalism increased the bitterness and hostility of
the workers towards the government, particularly after the Peterloo
Massacre of 1819. A Radical War ensued in Scotland and culminated
in a call in the west of Scotland in 1820 to strike and to bear arms
in order to establish a Scottish Republic. Sixty thousand workers,
among them handloom weavers and colliers, heeded the call and an

57

armed insurrection ensued with a march on the Carron Ironworks.
The march was intercepted by soldiers and the revolt put down and
this phase of radicalism came to an end, only for the door to be
pushed open once more in the early 1830s. Workers united with the
middle classes were able to win a major political concession from the
ruling classes in parliament in the form of the Reform Act of 1832,
although not before mass demonstrations had taken place, and polit-
ical threats and hints of revolution had been made. However,
although the workers had campaigned with as much enthusiasm as
the middle classes for the franchise they were disappointed as only
the propertied were granted the vote.
The narrative of political struggle in these decades of war and
peace throws up a number of questions and issues concerning the
politics and language of class; the economic and the social; and the
national and the transnational. There is little doubt that the radical
movement of the years of the French Wars was inspired and led by
the middle classes. However, these were the same people who were
in the vanguard of the creation of free trade and the destruction of
customary practices and other restraints on trade which seemed to
attack the moral economy of the labouring classes. Yet there is evi-
dence that groups of workers such as handloom weavers figured very
prominently in radical organisations such as the Friends of the People
and that many were converted to the ideas of Tom Paine. [135 ] Indeed,
it was groups such as the weavers that during the repression years of
the 1800s kept the radical movement alive in their membership of a
clandestine and insurrectionary organisation - the United Scotsmen. [136 ]
Why the degree of collaboration between two essentially antagonistic
social classes?
The alliance was viable because of the possibilities each group saw
in reform of the British state. Workers had been used to petitioning
the state for redress of economic grievances, and JPs as the embodi-
ment of the local state had been appealed to on a regular basis to fix
minimum wages and prices. Until the end of the first decade of the
nineteenth century JPs were not unsympathetic to the demands of
the workers. In 1799 high food prices saw JPs in Lanarkshire grant
wage increases to wrights; in the same year Midlothian JPs granted
Leith shipwrights a 4d a day rise in wages; and after much petitioning
the Edinburgh printers were granted a table of piece rates by the
Court of Session in 1805. [137 ]However, with the growing popularity of
the economic doctrines of Adam Smith and other classical economists
among employers and politicians the state was increasingly moving

58

_Radical Struggles in Scotland_

in a less than even-handed way in dealing with disputes between
masters and workers. In 177 5 and 1799 legislation abolished serfdom
in the mining industry, but not as a humanitarian act, more as an
attempt to 'free the masters' hands over wages and workrates with-
out the interference of powerful combinations' .[138 ] In the same year,
the first Combination Acts were passed and a year later they were
extended to cover every trade in England. Although the aim was to
prevent the growth of unions and political organisations, the success
of the Acts in this direction was decidedly patchy. [139 ] Moreover, their
legal status in Scotland was open to debate, and their interpretation
was more or less left to the discretion of the judiciary, some of whom
were sympathetic to legal interference, and some who were decidedly
against it. In spite of the ambiguity surrounding their interpretation,
the leaders of the Glasgow weavers' strike of 1812 were charged and
found guilty of the 'crime of combination' .[140 ]

The aim of the strikers had been to establish minimum piece rates
through parliamentary legislation, but on being rebuffed twice by the
authorities, who had been successfully counter petitioned by the
employers, a seven week strike ensued in the west of Scotland; an
event which led to the arrest and imprisonment of the leadership for
two to eighteen months in February 1813. [141 ] Four months after the
defeat of the weavers, statutes allowing JPs to intervene in industrial
disputes were abolished by parliament and the market was given the
freedom to set the level of wages. [142 ]The radical cry against 'class leg-
islation' inspired weavers and other groups of workers to see the
possibilities arising out of the reform of the state, and this made pos-
sible the construction of political alliances with middle class radicals.
As a result petitioning the local JP gave way to the petitioning of the
'nation'.
The economic depression and the mass unemployment which fol-
lowed the end of the French Wars gave the workers little alternative
but to turn to radical political practice. The high-handed attitude of
the state, the massacre of Peterloo and the repression of political
activity only intensified the agitation for franchise reform. A meeting
in Paisley in 1819 to condemn the 'butchers' of Peterloo led to five
days of conflict between workers and the troops of the 80th Regiment
and the 7th and 10th Hussars. [143 ] The actions of the landowners' gov-
ernment also alienated large numbers of people migrating to urban
centres from the Scottish Highlands and Ireland. Their historical
experiences of dealing with the landowning classes and the bitterness
which that had induced in them were intensified by these displays of

59

aristocratic arrogance. Appeals to bridle the power of the aristocracy
by radicals, therefore, touched a raw nerve in this section of Scottish
society and brought a ready response from them.
Although some historians have interpreted these events from a
nationalist perspective, [144 ] nationalism was only one strand which
comprised the ideology of political radicalism; the main aim of the
reform movement was the democratisation of the British state, rather
than establishing a Scottish republic. However, since that state was
controlled primarily by the English landowning class, and given the
history of active resistance in Scotland to the Union of 1707, oppo-
sition to political tyranny was, at times, overlain with assertions of
national identity. Fifteen thousand Scots came to Bannockburn in
1814 to commemorate the SOOth anniversary of the defeat of Edward
II; and the popular Scottish song 'Scots wa'hae' was used as a rallying
call against tyranny by the radicals north of the border in the years
1817-20. [145 ] The republican aspirations of the abortive uprising of
1820 represented the apotheosis of the weaving of national identity
with radical politics.
The nationalism of the protestors was, however, half-hearted. At
mass anti-government demonstrations in Paisley in 1819 banners
referred to 'Bruce' and 'Wallace', but there were others which referred
to the 'Magna Carta' and to the rights of 'Britons'. [146 ] As Christopher
Smout points out, the symbolism of resistance to tyrants which was
the essence of the lyrics of 'Scots wa'hae' also appealed to cotton
spinners in Lancashire. [147 ] Furthermore, it was clear that in the period
1817-20 Scottish radicals looked to England for leadership. Indeed,
the Radical insurrection of 1820 to establish a Scottish republic was
timed to coincide with a rising in England; an event which did not
happen, although there were uprisings in Lancashire and Yorkshire. [148 ]
There is also the patriotism of Scottish workers to take account of;
something which was particularly evident on the monarch's birthday.
Twenty thousand people turned out on Glasgow Green in June 1795
to watch a review of the Glasgow Royal Volunteers [149 ] and four years
later it was reported that 20 000 attended a review of the Renfrewshire
Volunteer Association on 31 August. [150 ] In 1820 there were 50 000
'patriotic' spectators at a military display on Glasgow Green. [151 ]
Although the celebration of the monarch's birthday was generally a
drunkenly riotous affair, and the 'mob' used it as means of lampoon-
ing and jostling their social superiors, there was little attempt to
politicise the event in the direction of radicalism; indeed, only in
'Edinburgh in 1792, and perhaps Perth around the same time, is
there any connection between the monarch's birthday celebrations and

60


-----

Radicalism' .[152 ] Thus, nationalism in this context was contradictory
and dualistic and did not lead in Scotland, as it did in peripheral
nations such as Norway and Portugal, to independence from a more
powerful neighbour. Scots were able to combine a sense of Scottish
identity with an equally powerful and compelling sense of being
North Britons. [153 ] The fact that in the reform agitation of the crisis
years 1830-32, and again in the Chartist campaigns of the late 1830s
and early 1840s, Scottish republicanism played no part in mobilising
workers tends to point to the essentially ephemeral nature of this
political phenomenon.
The other outstanding feature of working-class radicalism at this
time was the rejection of violence as a means of changing the
political system. The shadowy United Scotsmen movement, although
active in weaving communities in the 1800s, was unable to mobilise
mass support for its Jacobin-inspired insurrectionary form of poli-
tics.154 The fact that only forty to fifty men could be persuaded to
march on the Carron ironworks during the 1820 Radical War [155 ] also
points to the inability of the idea of armed insurrection to capture the
imagination and support of the workers in Scotland. Moreover, after
1820 political protest became peaceful and orderly, although riots,
particularly those associated with the monarch's birthday, continued
to be a part of the rich, but rough and disruptive, culture of urban
life with serious outbursts occurring in 1819 and 1820 in Glasgow.
The riots, on the whole, tended to be associated with the unskilled
and poor than the politically organised skilled workers. Indeed,
according to newspaper reports of these carnivals of the oppressed,
the crowds were mainly comprised of young adult males and boys:
the 'veriest scum of the city'. [156 ]
Although the prospect of violent revolution was remote, there
were clear signs of a growing awareness among workers of their
common or shared grievances and the need to organise collectively to
alter the political status quo. This view is at odds with the prevailing
orthodoxy among Scottish historians regarding the seriousness of
the threat posed by workers to property and the institutions of civil
society during this period. Christopher Smout best sums up this
view when he says 'the unenfranchised masses ... were so divided by
income, life expectancy, culture and creed as to pose, on the face of it,
little threat to property' .[157 ] Moreover, the organisations of collective
self-defence- the trade unions- operated a sectional policy which
promoted their interests at the expense of workers in general and
were little involved in radical political activity. [158 ]
By viewing the working class as essentially fragmented, orthodox

61


-----

historiography seems to disregard the factors pulling against the forces
of division. As we have seen, skilled workers were facing similar
problems as regards issues of apprentice restriction and the labour
supply. Periodic unemployment as a consequence of the operation of
the trade cycle also posed a threat to the security of skilled workers
and their families. These uncertainties were duplicated across all
trades and were articulated in the growing labour press of the period,
which brought different groups of workers together. There were also
signs of trades supporting each other in struggle. During the weavers'
struggles to limit the number of apprentices in 1811, their petition to
parliament had the support of 'the whole of the trades of any conse-
quence in the town of [Glasgow]'. [159 ] Collaboration could take a
political turn as in 1820 when 60 000 workers answered the call to
strike. The involvement of trade unions in these political struggles
was remarked upon by the prosecutor fiscal for Glasgow, when he
said to the crown agent that the leaders of the cotton spinners were
'again, at least most of them, in jail as Radicals' .[16]° Christopher
Whatley's work on working-class communities also shows how ethnic
and occupational divisions tended to crumble in moments of crisis.
He found that within the Glasgow parish of Barony, where most of
the weaving looms were concentrated, and where there was a con-
siderable number of spinning mills, a calico print works, an iron
works and a few coal mines, there was a high volume of political
activity prior to 1830. Most disturbances either took place here or
'involved' a disproportionate number of people from Barony. This
was also an area which had a high concentration of Irish workers,
both Catholic and Protestant, and their families; indeed, the most
turbulent districts in Barony, that is, Anderston, Calton, St Johns and
Shettleston, were those with the highest proportion of Irish-born
residents. [161 ] These finding should make us a little suspicious over
accounts of the period which all too readily fall back on fragmen-
tation and collaboration as elemental parts of political analysis.
However, more research needs to be done on other parishes in Glas-
gow and in other large towns on these issues before the solidarities
of class and community in Scotland in this period can be delineated.
There is also the problem of reconciling the political and the eco-
nomic. The experiences of change and tension in the social relations
of the workplace were leading workers to develop a view of the econ-
omy, and their position within in it, which was in opposition to the
radical political ideology which they had accepted. In the workplace
a political economy based on custom and regulation was articulated

62


-----

_Radical Struggles in Scotland_

which put the trade unions at odds with the free market philosophy of
the employing class. The labour theory of value became the bedrock
of their economic analysis. As the Radical Reformer's Gazette put it:
'the land derives all its value from the labour and skill applied to it,
and that there is no Capital in the Country but has sprung from the
same source'. [162 ] There was also a persistent demand for the economic
system to be based on co-operation rather than competition. How-
ever, artisanal conceptions of politics, as an organised conspiracy of
the landowning class to maintain its privileges and power, led them
to adopt anti-landlord policies, which were antagonistic to their grow-
ing interest in, and advocacy of, quasi-socialist plans of co-operation.
Indeed, as Fiona Montgomery argues, championing free trade over
protectionism came close to classical economic doctrine. [163 ] The labour
newspaper The Herald to the Trades Advocate, extravagantly claimed
that free trade:

gives a stimulus to exertion, encouragement to the noblest
energies of scientific genius ... diffuses liberal sentiments, and
benevolent feelings ... while monopoly produces sloth, violence
and extravagance ... in a few; poverty, wretchedness and ser-
vility in the many.l64

Trade unionists continued to believe throughout this period that the
Corn Laws and excessive taxation forced 'honourable' employers
to press down on wages. Corruption in government was thus still
viewed as the main cause of all economic ills, and for this reason
workers in Scotland and elsewhere in Britain were still prepared to
accept the political leadership of middle-class radicals. Moreover, as
the central 'issues' in the workplace remained 'ones of control rather
than ownership of the means of production', [165 ] the tensions referred
to above did not obstruct the emergence of joint middle- and working-
class political campaigns for reform.
Large crowds throughout Scotland demonstrated in favour of
parliamentary reform in the early 1830s. In Glasgow, three distinct
organisations emerged: the predominantly middle-class Reform
Association; the National Political Union supported by the petty
bourgeoisie and artisans; and factory operatives' committees com-
posed of representatives from trade unions and workshops. They
were, however, by no means exclusive and membership was fluid;
additionally joint campaigns were organised and a common ideology
was expressed on classical radical lines. However, working-class

63


-----

radicals had a different set of priorities to that of middle-class
reformers. They stressed universal suffrage, annual parliaments and
secret ballots, while manufacturers and merchants in Aberdeen and
elsewhere demanded burgh reform and an end to self-elected coun-
cils.166 Thus, the question of priority provoked class tensions between
those in the radical camp. However, as Fiona Montgomery notes,
artisans in Glasgow were prepared to accept this arrangement as
they 'felt that more could be gained by co-operation and working
through the system, than by outright hostility'. [167 ] There were no riots
in Scotland on the scale of Nottingham, Derby and Bristol during
the reform crisis, although contemporary Alexander Somerville
reported that, after the second reading of the Reform Bill in the
Commons, in Edinburgh there was an orgy of window breaking by
the 'ten thousand headed mob'. [168 ] In Glasgow, however, property was
respected and, in spite of talk of revolution, political demonstrations
were orderly and peaceful. As _The Herald to the Trades Advocate_
put it: 'they [the authorities] will strain their eye-sight before they see
any movement in this quarter' .[169 ] Any talk of 'arming' was interpreted
by Glasgow workers as defending the king and his ministers rather
than promoting a revolution.'7°

With the failure of the Reform Act to enfranchise the workers and
the disappointment this created, as well as the failure of the middle
classes to support factory reform in the shape of Sadler's Ten Hours
Bill (manufacturers in Fife and Glasgow actively opposed it), [171 ] the
emphasis turned to trade unionism and Owenite socialism. Robert
Owen offered a complete alternative to the capitalist system and a
different analysis of labour's oppression to that put forward by
radicals. Owen argued that the root cause of workers' oppression lay
in the exploititive social relations of industrial capitalism rather
than corruption in government. To Owen and his followers changing
the political system was irrelevant; the way forward was in building
small communities of producers based on his principles of utopian
socialism. Ideas of building a co-operative and harmonious alternative
to competitive capitalism struck a chord with those workers who
were experiencing displacement due to economic competition and
technological change. Thus the Dundee and Lochee Weavers' Union,

1000 strong, resolved in 1834 to 'make an attempt at manufacturing
for themselves', and Aberdeen had 900 members established in eight
branches of the co-operative movement. [172 ] To spread the word the
Universal Community Society of Rational Religionists was formed in
1835 and by 1839 it had sixty-two branches in Britain, four of which

64

were in Scotland at Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee and Paisley with a
membership of around 300. [173 ] In addition, there were also a number
of co-operative stores established in the late 1830s at Hawick and
Galashiels. [174 ] Even during the Chartist period when attention was
firmly fixed on political reform, there were several experiments in
co-operation. Co-operative stores, inspired by Owenism, were estab-
lished in places as far apart as Leith, Greenock, Tillicoutry, Dalkeith,
Hawick, Forfar and Coupar Angus. By the end of 1840, there were
sixteen Chartist co-operative stores, in addition to those which were
reputed to exist in 'every village' in Fife, as well as an Aberdeen
Association of Producers, which owned a store in the town's
Gallowgate and set up a savings bank for members in 1845.[175 ]
However, in spite of these ventures, Owenite socialism failed to
make a significant impact on Scottish workers. Owen's GNCTU
was an ephemeral success in 1834, but as a trade union, and not as
a vehicle for ushering in a new moral world. The main ideological
weakness was that Owenism failed to develop a theory of politics in
general, and the state in particular. Moral regeneration rather than
political change was seen by Owenites as the central goal of labour.
Because that moral reforming spirit envisaged a rational society and
an equal role for women it came up against the deeply held religious
principles of skilled workers. Peter MacKenzie's _Scotch Reformers'_
_Gazette_ condemned Ownenite lectures on rational religion and
appealed to the Glasgow authorities to prevent 'the disgraceful
proceedings of these infamous Socialists' .[176 ] A godless society was
anathema to workers in Scotland at this time: a point endorsed by an
artisan journal when it reported that 'there was strong hostility to
Owen's religious views among the Glasgow trades', and to underline
this the _The Herald to the Trades Advocate_ dropped the sub-title
_Co-operative Journal from its masthead._ [177 ] John Hodge, in his con-
temporary study of Owenism, also pointed to the secularism of the
movement in analysing the reasons for its collapse after 1845. [178 ] But
a stronger reason was that the republics of petty producers, envisaged
by Owen as the future social organisation of society, were backward
looking and irrelevant solutions to the problems faced by trades such
as cotton spinning, engineering, iron-making, and so on, which were
created by industrialisation. Traditionless, these trades could not
look back to a 'golden age' of domestic production as starving hand-
loom weavers could, and, thus, concentrated on making the best
bargain they could within the free market. A lacuna developed
between the utopian social prescription of Owen and the direct

social experience of the developing proletariat. The co-operative
societies continued to grow but, shorn of their millenarian role, they
merely modified free market mechanisms rather than superseded
them.
The peripheralisation of quasi-socialist alternatives such as
Owenism meant that the links forged with the middle classes during
the suffrage campaigns of the early 1830s were never wholly severed.
The split between the anti-working class Whigs and the radicals in
the mid-1830s led to a new configuration of Scottish politics which
held out hope for the emergence of a new reform movement. John
Taylor and the 'advanced' radicals set up the Scottish Radical Associ-
ation (SRA) in December 1836, which later became the Universal
Suffrage Association. The SRA adopted four basic political principles

      - universal male suffrage, annual parliaments, vote by ballot and a
voluntary church system. In Edinburgh, the Radical Association
added repeal of the Corn Laws to its basic principles at a meeting in
July 1837, as well as amending its demand for universal suffrage to
household suffrage, in order to attract wider support from the pro-
gressive urban middle classes. [179 ] There was also a certain amount of
co-operation on the industrial front. During the cotton spinners'
strike, rioting occurred at the Oakbank Mills in May 1837. An
appeal from the Tory Sheriff of Lanarkshire, Archibald Alison, among
propertied families for special constables to contain the riot led to
only one man answering the call. In Glasgow, Liberal manufacturers
obstructed Alison's plan of extending police powers to curb the
dispute in outlying areas. [180 ] In Paisley, manufacturers supported
Fielden's Minimum Wage Bill in 1835, and agreed on a voluntary
basis to fix prices in order to stabilise weavers' wages; additionally,
a more liberal poor law operated with provision made for the
able-bodied. [181 ] These initiatives which maintained the distinction in
working-class circles of the 'honourable' and 'dishonourable' employer,
as well the attachment of the artisans to the doctrines of free trade,
were important during the Chartist agitation of the late 1830s and
early 1840s in ensuring a dialogue, and to some extent an alliance,
continued between workers and the middle classes.
The Chartist movement which emerged in 1838 demanded a
wholesale reform of the British state and the incorporation of the
working class in the constitution. Chartist demands were inscribed in
the Six Points of the People's Charter drawn up by the London Work-
ing Men's Association in 1838. Although primarily political demands,
once achieved they were to establish a platform for a programme of

66


-----

_Radical Struggles in Scotland_

social and economic reform. A national petition was drawn up in
favour of the Six Points by the Birmingham Political Union (BPU) and
speakers were sent out to other areas of Britain to stir up support.
Indeed, Scotland's political reawakening was largely the responsibil-
ity of the BPU and their 'holy and peaceful' campaign north of the
border. [182 ]
The response to Chartism in Scotland was greatest, like elsewhere
in Britain, during the years 1839-42 when unemployment was high,
bread was dear, and trade unions weak. However, support for the
Charter cannot be seen simply as an economistic knee-jerk response to
worsening economic conditions by poor and unemployed workers.
Miners and factory workers were more prominent during times of
severe economic distress such as in 1842, and again in the years
1847-48, but the backbone of the Chartist movement was radical
artisans and weavers in alliance with disaffected members of the
middle classes. Trade sections were established among coopers,
masons and shoemakers in Glasgow, and among coachmakers and
tailors in Edinburgh. [183 ] The artisanal and middle-class basis of the
movement was, however, even more pronounced in the leadership.
The Central Committee in Scotland was made up of a powerloom
weaver, Mathew Cullen, an engineering trade unionist, W. C. Pattison,
and an Edinburgh scavenger, but middle class members existed too
in the shape of James Moir and George Ross, Glasgow shopkeepers,
John McCrae, an Ayrshire teacher, and Dr Glover, of Edinburgh. [184 ]
In Aberdeen, there were no factory operatives among the leadership
cadre and the principal activists came from the shoemaking and
weaving trades; [185 ] and in Paisley, the Rev. Patrick Brewster was the
main advocate of Chartist reform. The social structure of the move-
ment, particularly of the leadership cadre, infused a moral dimension
into what was essentially a political movement. Most of the Chartist
leaders in Glasgow, including Cranston, Fraser and MacFarlane, were
involved with the temperance movement at an officiallevel. [186 ] Fraser
initiated a nationwide campaign in 1838 'in which advocacy of ...
total abstinence held almost equal prominence with that of universal
suffrage' .[187 ] The TAS, as we have seen, not only preached temper-
ance, but also supported the Six Points of the Charter. [188 ] Temperance
was not restricted to one class, it cut across all social groups and
acted as a means of furthering social contacts between artisans and
the middle classes in Scottish society.
Religion performed a similar role to that of temperance. Most
Chartists were said to be 'devout, God-fearing men, whose scepticism

67


-----

[about religion] was confined to the behaviour of false pastors'. [189 ]
Chartists were also prominent in the dissenting churches, particularly
the United Secessional Church and the Relief Synod. [190 ] However, the
refusal of the radical churches and their ministers to take up explicitly
political demands led some Chartists, in order to unite Christianity
with the message of social justice and political freedom, to set up
their own ministries. The first Chartist Churches were established in
May 1839 in Hamilton, Paisley and Bridgeton. Five months later
regular services were being held on the Sabbath by the Glasgow,
Bridgeton, Gorbals, Paisley and Hamilton Chartist Associations. [191 ]
By 1841 a delegate to a conference of Scottish Chartist Churches
could claim that 'a Chartist place of worship is now to be found on
the Lord's Day in almost every town of note from Aberdeen to
Ayr' .[192 ] These churches performed baptisms, marriages, funerals and
communion, and held their own Easter, Christmas and New Year
celebrations with 'tea drinking, concerts ... and dancing' .[193 ]
In keeping with their democratic principles there was no minister
but a rotational chairman and vice-chairman who between them
conducted services and performed other ceremonies. The Church's
social gospel was summed up by Eileen Yeo: 'their Christ was a
working man who had been crucified on the social rack like they;
their mission [was] to win back the rights God had given, but which
the rich and powerful, the priesthood among them, had taken away'.
Chartist Churches had their parallels in England, but only in the
form of holding Sunday services in the numerous branch premises of
the National Charter Association in the early 1840s. Prior to this
development the English Chartists were given to holding protest
demonstrations at hostile Anglican and dissenting sect churches. [194 ]
The more formal organisation of the Chartist Churches in Scotland,
as we will see, demonstrated the manner in which the social basis of
Chartism profoundly affected its politics and language.
The moralism with which temperance and religion infused Scottish
Chartism made the movement amenable to the idea of 'moral force'
as against 'physical force' as a way of achieving political reform, and
made it less hostile than its English equivalent to alliances with other
social classes. However, at the same time, one could argue that there
were two Chartist movements in Scotland: there was the moral and
peaceful movement of the period 1838-40, and there was the more
aggressive and confrontational movement of the years 1841-42 and
1848. This difference was linked to condition of the economy and
the social structure of the support for the Charter. lain Hutchinson

68

_Radical Struggles in Scotland_

noted that in the agitation of 1848 the social composition of the
movement was changing to include the Irish and young unskilled
workers: 'two categories which had not been so central to the earlier
phase of Chartism' .19[5 ] It was these groups which were responsible
for the rioting which accompanied the Chartist revival of 1848,
although their centrality to the movement is debated below.
In the first phase of Chartist agitation the movement had suffered
severe splits over the issue of moral versus physical force. The former
were moderates and associated with Chartists, such as William Lovett
of the LWMA and Thomas Attwood of the BPU; the latter were
supporters of Feargus O'Connor and believed in the use of non-
constitutional methods, including armed force and national strikes,
to achieve their ends. The Scots supported the moral force delegates
at the May 1839 Convention in Birmingham which gave effect to
the resolution passed earlier at the meeting on Calton Hill, Edinburgh.
The delegates to Edinburgh had resolved that only peaceful means
should be employed to obtain the Charter. [196 ] Although the strategy
of using moral force was adopted by most Chartist associations in
Scotland, there were pockets of support for O'Connor's position.
Research by Tony Clarke has shown that in 1839 associations from
parts of the north-east of Scotland, particularly Forfarshire,
Clackmananshire, Dunfermline and from Renfrewshire favoured a
national strike supported by an armed people to obtain the Charter.
However, in Ayrshire, Glasgow and Lanarkshire, Edinburgh and
parts of the Lothians support was lukewarm for this kind of direct
action, [197 ]in spite of the fact that there were few Chartists in Scotland
who could be found to endorse the Rev. Patrick Brewster's position
of obedience to constituted authority. Scottish artisans, with their
strongly held belief in their independence, favoured the idea that
'obedience to authority was conditional on the enjoyment of consti-
tutional rights' .[198 ]
The rejection of the Chartist petition by the Commons in 1839
led to a decline in the influence of moderate moral force Chartism.
In Aberdeen, the movement split and the Aberdeen Charter Union
(ACU) replaced the Aberdeen Working Men's Association as the
focal point of Chartist organisation. The ACU had strong links with
the trade unions and in 1841 proposals to organise a trades demon-
stration in support of O'Connor produced general hysteria in the
magistracy and town council. Millowners were called upon to prevent
their workers attending the demonstration. Five hundred special
constables were sworn in and the military were given sixteen rounds

of ball cartridge. [199 ] In Glasgow, O'Connor's attack on 'the saints of
the Glasgow Chartist synod' moved the Association in favour of the
physical force position. The shifting political strategy of the Chartists
towards a more confrontational position with the state coincided in
1842 with the onset of severe economic distress. The rejection by
parliament of the second Chartist petition initiated the call for the
'Sacred Month', that is, a month-long general strike. This brought a
violent response in the north of England in the so-called 'plug riots'. [200 ]
However, in Scotland the response was muted; something which has
led historians to suggest that the moral basis of Scottish Chartism
and its tenuous links with the trade unions precluded support for
industrial action.
Hassan argues that during the miners' strike of 1842 there were no
attempts by the Midlothian colliers to link their economic grievances
with demands for political reform,2° [1 ] and Rob Duncan points out
that the strike itself was conducted as a series of discrete local
actions. Moreover, Aberdeen Chartists opposed the 'use of the strike
weapon and condemned the violence in 1842'.[202 ] But the evidence
seems somewhat contradictory. Alan Campbell, in his study of the
Lanarkshire miners, states that at a 'great meeting' of miners held
near Coatbridge a resolution was passed in favour of Ashley's Bill to
exclude women from the mines and also in support of the People's
Charter. [203 ] Thus, the evidence here points to a more explicit linking
of politics with economic grievances by miners' leaders. This was
consistent with the far greater degree of proletarianisation of miners
in Lanarkshire, particularly in the mines owned by the great iron-
masters such as Bairds of Gartsherrie, compared to the semi-rural,
paternalistic coalfields of Midlothian. Likewise in Dundee, in the
summer of 1842, jobless workmen allied themselves with millworkers
to demand 'The Charter and Nothing Less'. As the crisis deepened
in autumn a public meeting attended by 8000 workers supported
overwhelmingly a proposal to call a political strike for the implemen-
tation of the Charter. Although the strike call was heeded by 4000
workers, a planned march on Forfar with the intention of arousing
support in neighbouring towns ended in failure. [2]0[4 ]
Regardless of the success of these demands, the actions and lan-
guage of the workers point to the weaknesses in Hassan's and
Duncan's analyses. The strikes in the mining industry may have been
concerned with economistic issues, such as wages and hours, and
control of the labour process, but to confront the employers and the
state on these matters involved a perception of the social order which

70


-----

alluded to the presence of different and antagonistic sets of interests
in society. Moreover, in searching for the, admittedly tenuous, links
between trade unions and Chartism there is a tendency in Duncan's
and Hassan's work to focus on formal organisations; an approach
which obscures the fact that much union activity at this time was
informal and based on immediate workgroup solidarities, rather than
the trade. As Clive Behagg points out:

There is a clear resonance between the workplace as a democ-
ratic forum, the 'worst of democracies' as critics would insist,
and a political vision with an emphasis on participation and
accountability brought about by universal suffrage and annual
parliaments. [205 ]

However, the failure of the 'Sacred Month' and the return of better
economic conditions in 1843 saw militancy dissipate and moderates
resume leadership of the movement. In Glasgow, despite the fact that
some 78 000 people had signed the National Petition in 1842, 'with-
in a year [Julian] Harney and others reported that the movement had
all but gone except for the Chartist Churches'. [206 ] The restoration of
traditional radicals to prominence coincided with attempts to pro-
mote greater understanding with the middle classes, particularly those
involved in the struggles against the Corn Laws. In the preceding
years tensions had run high between the Chartists and the Anti Corn
Law League (ACLL). In 1840 the Glasgow Chartists decided to
intervene at all public meetings of the League; indeed, at any meeting
which diverted attention from the Charter. [207 ] Relations were said to
have deteriorated so badly that each class was consistently 'abusing
and opposing' the other. [208 ] In other places the situation was no more
friendly. In Aberdeen, the ACU adopted a pronounced anti-middle
class and ACLL position;[209 ] and in Scotland as a whole there was the
feeling among Chartists that little was to be gained 'by union with
doubtful reformers'. [210 ]
However, in spite of these tensions, there never existed the enmity
in Scotland between the workers and the middle classes as occurred
in England due to the implementation of New Poor Law in 1834.
Chartists in Scotland were quite prepared to sign petitions in favour
of repeal of the Corn Laws, particularly those working in export
industries for whom the 'ideology of economic Liberalism had an
apparently irrefutable logic';[211 ] and those, such as John Mitchell,
leader of the moderate Aberdeen WMA, who saw in the campaign

71

an opportunity to 'unmask the titled locust band' of landowners. [212 ]
From 1842 onwards there was also manifested a closer collaboration
between the League and the Chartists, and between the workers and
the middle classes as evidence in the cross-class support for the
Complete Suffrage Union established in 1841 by Joseph Sturge.
Tensions, however, continued to exist on the question of priorities,
with the Chartists arguing that reform should take precedence over
repeal, and the ACLL taking the opposite view.
When the Corn Laws were repealed in 1846 handloom weavers in
Paisley staged a series of celebratory demonstrations. [213 ] However, the
blessings of free trade were little in evidence as the economy plunged
once more into crisis in 1847; an event which coincided with the
beginning of revolution in Europe. From this favourable platform the
third and final phase of Chartism was launched, but, like the others,
it ended in failure as the Commons rejected the third petition. How-
ever, the finale involved the construction of a new alliance between
Irish Catholics and native Scots which prefigured later political
developments.
Sectarianism and snobbery had driven a wedge between the two
communities which had been fatal to the prosecution of the political
struggle for the franchise. After 1842 there were a series of social and
political initiatives which encouraged the two communities to pull
closer together. The assault by the Catholic hierarchy on drunken-
ness among the Irish did much to improve their image in Scotland.
Thirty thousand Irish in Glasgow were led to establish a connection
with the temperance movement as a result of a series of campaigns
run by Father Theobald Mathew in 1843.[214 ] The ties were further
strengthened in protests against the operation of the Scottish Poor
Laws which not only discriminated against the Irish, but also, under
the Law of Settlement, against the rural migrants flooding into the
cities. In February 1843 joint protests were made by the Chartists
and the Irish in Edinburgh over this issue. [215 ] Politically, the adoption
by the Chartists of Irish demands for the repeal of the Union between
Britain and Ireland made an alliance irresistible. There was, however,
one obstacle to a full blown rapprochement between the Irish and the
Chartists: Daniel O'Connell. Since his condemnation of the Glasgow
spinners' strike of 1837, O'Connell had become a figure on which a
great deal of indigenous radical and trade union hatred had coa-
lesced. His death in 184 7 removed any remaining barriers to closer
co-operation between the Irish Democratic Convention (IDC) and
the Chartist movement. [216 ]

Perhaps the presence of large numbers of Irish workers, with their
historic association with violence, made the reaction to the rejection
of the third petition all the more aggressive. The year had begun with
the moral force leadership in the ascendancy as electoral associations,
or 'People's Leagues', were formed having equal membership of
Chartists and CSUers. Glasgow City Council passed a resolution
supporting Hume's motion in the Commons for an extension of the
franchise. [217 ] However, by March 1848 the political initiative briefly
passed to the riotous mobs of impoverished and starving workers. A
riot broke out in Glasgow among the 'unemployed operatives' and
the people marched through the streets crying 'Bread or Revolution'.
A confrontation with the military left five protestors dead. [218 ] The
'spirit of rebelliousness' also spread among colliers and iron workers
to the west of Glasgow and the authorities were said to have been
'seriously alarmed' at 'midnight ... secret meetings held near the
pitheads, at which highly spiced, even seditious, speech-making was
indulged in'.[219 ] Following the rejection of the third petition a meeting
of Chartists on Edinburgh's Calton Hill passed a resolution calling
for the 'necessity of arming themselves and purchasing a musket or a
pike', and two weeks later in Adam Square Hall a further resolution
advocating the formation of a National Guard 1600 strong was
carried by a large majority; while in Aberdeen a 'National Guard of
around 1000 men had been formed'. [220 ]

The riotous events surrounding the Chartist revival in 1848 are the
subject of some debate regarding the participants. lain Hutchinson,
as we have noted, saw the young, unskilled workers and the Irish as
central to the movement in this period. Alexander Wilson, on the
other hand, argues that while it is true that there was a great deal
more involvement of the Irish in Chartist struggles in 1848, it would
be incorrect to include the latter group. Also it would be misleading
'to call the disturbances [of March 1848] Chartist riots', as even the
Tory Scotsman recognised, this 'was a mistake unjust in itself'. John
McCaffrey views the actions of the Glasgow mobs as less disorgan-
ised and criminal, and while the links were not formalised with
Chartism, it is clear from the evidence that the crowds were inspired
by Chartist denunciations of unemployment and social distress. A
list of those arrested and tried for riotous behaviour showed that
only 26 out of the 64 were unemployed, and their ranks included
skilled iron workers, a printer and a coppersmith. As McCaffrey
concludes 'this analysis hardly squares with a picture of the riot
caused by a combination of the idle, the curious and the criminal'.[221 ]

73


-----

The confrontational stance of the Chartists alienated the supporters
of franchise extension in the middle classes. [222 ] Perhaps this is because
during 1848 the challenge to property had become more apparent as
the numbers of disaffected young, unskilled operatives and Irish
overwhelmed the respectable radical artisans. The fears of the middle
classes in granting the vote to this section of society were succinctly
expressed by the Lord Provost of Edinburgh when he said:

Suppose [the working classes] get universal suffrage and sup-
pose ... that five-sixths of the community belonged to the
working classes ... it was clear ... they would legislate for their
own interest and make wages as high as possible.[223 ]

The challenge to capital was clear and the middle classes closed
ranks with the rest of private property, including their traditional
enemies in the landowning class. The alliance of property in 1848
reflected the way the divisions among ruling groups in Scottish and
British society had been healed. Once the Corn Laws had been
repealed there was little space between the two which radicals could
exploit to create a crisis within the state. In the face of threats to
property the aristocratically-controlled state was resolute, safe in the
knowledge that it had the backing of the vast bulk of the middle
classes. As one contemporary journalist put it when reflecting on the
riots of 1848: 'the prompt suppression of the Glasgow riots ...

[showed] the men that the arm of the law was still a power in the
land'.224
When examining the reasons why the Chartists failed to achieve
their goals the response of the state is of paramount importance. This
does not mean that the divisions within the movement over the issues
of moral versus physical force, of co-operation or opposition to the
ACLL, as well as the personality clashes within the leadership, were not
harmful to the effective mobilisation of the workers in pursuit of the
Charter, but they were not decisive. Even the most resolute and united
leadership cadre would not have been able to defeat a solidaristic
state. Moreover, the mobilisation of the Irish at an earlier date might
have generated greater unity within the movement, but it would not
have removed the issue of the state's willingness to use its monopoly
of coercion to frustrate and ultimately destroy the Chartist movement.
In these circumstances reciprocal violence was the only possible
strategy open to the Chartists. However, this was a route which the
skilled workers refused to travel. Scottish workers rejected the use of

###### 74


-----

_Radical Struggles in Scotland_

violence as a vehicle of political change. As the children of the eigh-
teenth century Enlightenment, their's was a political culture in which
rational thought and peaceful persuasion were elemental. As Christo-
pher Smout points out, artisans in Scotland held to the strong belief
that 'inequality could and would be overthrown by moral pressure
and by reason'; a belief reinforced by their religious convictions. [225 ]
The pacifism of the skilled stratum was also a reflection of their
material circumstances and position within the working classes. In
Aberdeen most of the stalwart members of the Chartist movement
were independent craftsmen and small producers and because of this
could not reconcile themselves to attacks on property. [226 ] The leader-
ship had a disproportionate representation from the petty bourgeoisie
and many were involved in temperance and other self-improvement
organisations. To a certain extent they all had a stake in the private
property system, which is perhaps why schemes of 'co-operation
were relatively unimportant to the Chartists'. [227 ]This was all the more
apparent post-1848, when even the working-class members of the
Central Committee joined the ranks of the Scottish petty bourgeoisie.
William C. Pattison, the engineering trade unionist, became owner of
a printing business; Matthew Cullen, the powerloom weaver, became
a professional reformer and leading light in social reform movement
in Glasgow. [228 ] The self-improving dimension of artisan ideology
allowed for understandings with the propertied strata in Scottish
society, particularly since they seemed to be operating within a com-
mon or shared value system. It was only the dispossessed industrial
proletariat who had nothing to lose, but they were far from numerous
and their interest in political reform was limited in most cases to
periods of economic distress. Moreover, the political economy of
radicalism had a fatal flaw for this section of the working class. As
Gareth Stedman Jones argues, if the economic and social misery of
the working class was due to its disenfranchisement, once the state
began addressing these problems, for example, through the Ten
Hours Act, and economic conditions improved, it was impossible to
convince the burgeoning proletariat that their grievances were linked
to an unreformed political system. The critique of class legislation,
therefore, did not extend to the class divisions at the point of pro-
duction; hostility to the bourgeoisie was based simply on the part
they played in the political system. As Stedman Jones makes clear:

Once, therefore, the conviction of the totally evil character of
the political system itself began to fade and distress became less

pervasive, there was no independent rationale within the radical
ideology for antagonism to the middle classes. [229 ]

Owenism with its critique of competitive capitalism might have filled
that ideological lacuna, but the movement's atheism, and advanced
views on personal relationships, resulted in its alienation from the
working people. Moreover, as Hamish Fraser points out, by the 1840s
the Owenite movement had become very petty bourgeois in compo-
sition, rather than working class. The leadership included men of
substantial means: James Nockles, the secretary, was a manufacturer;
James Edminston, treasurer, was middle class; and John Cairns and
Lloyd Jones were both wholesale tailors and clothiers. The leader of
the Paisley branch, James Motherwell, was a successful bookseller, of
which there were quite few in the movement. [230 ]As a result, Owenism
developed into a kind of mystical, semi-religious movement divorced
from the realities of working-class life.
In spite of the failure of Owenism to provide the programmatic
basis of worker unity, there is clear evidence of the development of
shared grievances and a more thorough understanding of the eco-
nomic bases of inequality among, at least, the literate, skilled workers.
###### It can be argued that the experiences of the 1830s and 1840s left
workers with a greater awareness of themselves as a social class with
interests and aspirations which set them apart from and, indeed, at
times, in opposition, to other social groups. As Michael Mann points
out, in spite of occupational, ethnic and religious differences, because
'the franchise was a class one, they had to organise as a class'. [231 ]
Although that awareness generally excluded workers in positions of
dependency on their employers, such as those in agricultural or
domestic service, workers at the cutting edge of economic and tech-
nological change saw the class basis of institutions more clearly.
Chartists demanded a wholesale set of social and economic reforms
which were inimical to the interests of the middle classes. As Ernest
Jones put it at a meeting in the Waterloo Rooms, Edinburgh, on 19
April 1848: '[The Chartists] were not merely political reformers but
social reformers'. [232 ] In Aberdeen, during the depressions of 1842 and
1848, Chartist leaders demanded full maintenance and the right to
work. Ten years earlier the Aberdeen operative masons criticised
the 'self-interested combinations of politicians, bankers, merchants,
manufacturers, corn dealers ... and the Established clergy', as did
Edinburgh Chartists in 1838 when they stated that there were only
two parties: 'the rich oppressors and the poor oppressed'. [233 ]

###### 76

_Radical Struggles in Scotland_

However, at this stage, although the social and economic demands
made by the Chartists could be considered antagonistic to free market
philosophy, they were not opposed to capitalism at a systemic level,
and this is the crucial factor in analysing the question of class con-
sciousness in this period. Chartists demanded that the rights of the
subordinate classes to some form of social security be recognised by
those in power. In that sense, it was not the class consciousness of
socialism which was being articulated, rather it was an endorsement
of the levelling spirit which had permeated the consciousness of
subordinate classes throughout history. This was brilliantly captured
in]. R. Stephens' speech to the Glasgow Chartists, when he demanded:
'that every man shall by his labour find comfortable food and
clothing - not only for himself, but for his wife and babes' .[234 ]
The levelling dimension of Chartist political philosophy was a
necessary outcome of the fact that the uneven development of the
Scottish economy was productive of a complex social structure.
Thus, Chartism had to appeal to a socially diverse constituency of
workers and petty bourgeois elements. The result was unity on the
Charter, but little else. As John Duncan, the pastor of the Dundee
Chartist Church, pointed out, within the Chartist ranks there were:

Repealers and anti-repealers, anti-Poor Law men and Malthu-
sians, O'Connorites, O'Brienites, Cobbettites, Churchmen,
Dissenters, or no Church-at-all men and others ... differing in
their views of political economy, morals and religion, wider as
the poles asunder. [235 ]

Thus, the form of working-class political practice which characterised
the 1830s and 1840s has to be understood in terms of an interaction
between past cultural formations with present sets of structures,
actions and attitudes.[236 ] It is this relationship which provides the basis
for opposing and contradictory linguistic interpretations centred
around the leitmotif of the people versus class. If on investigation
the historian of Chartism finds both tendencies embedded in the
language of political activism in these turbulent years, then this was
only to be expected given the different constituencies and interests
Chartists were attempting to address.
The period from the 1790s up to 1850 was a political learning
curve for the working people of Scotland and their allies. The outcome
of struggle was understanding what was politically and socially pos-
sible, and what was not. In terms of future political strategy there

was a general acceptance among workers of a framework of society
based on liberal capitalism. Thus a political system which appeared
for a number of decades as inherently unstable, a consequence of
profound socio-economic changes which disrupted the traditional
structures of family and working lives, as well as the landscape of
settlement, became highly durable. The older traditions of protest by
riot, and moral sentiments concerning fixed or fair prices and wages,
declined as organisation became more recognisably modern and
more attuned to working within the free market system. Trade
unions and pressure groups, operating within the mainstream legal
and political framework, became the accepted vehicles through
which grievances were to be articulated. Labour politics in Scotland
in the future would be democratic, evolutionary, independent and
morally infused by the interaction of temperance, religion and
respectability. But they would be understood within a language and
meaning system which recognised the validity of class as both an
abstract ideological formulation and a lived experience. This was the
political legacy of the Chartist years for the workers in Scotland and
the rest of Britain. Therefore, the demise of Chartism did not bring
an end to the process of class formation, or the desire of the workers
for political equality and social security; it simply entered a new
phase.

 INTERPRETATIONS

Coming as it does between the turbulent years of Chartism and the
rise of socialism in Scotland, the period 1850-1880 has been viewed
by some historians as a period of class collaboration and political con-
sensus.1 The class antagonisms of the Chartist era, which threatened
to undermine the political system, gave way to a more harmonious
and stable set of social relationships between capital and labour based
on a shared commitment to the values and ethos of liberal capitalism.
In this scenario of historical development stabilisation was closely
identified with the emergence of an elite upper stratum of 10-15 per
cent of the working class - the labour aristocracy - whose earnings,
lifestyle, status and values isolated it from the rest of the working
class and pushed into the welcoming arms of the middle class. Under
bourgeois influence and patronage the labour aristocracy actively
sought incorporation into the major institutions of civil society and
the state, and accepted a framework of industrial relations founded
on conciliation rather than conflict. Accommodation rather than
confrontation characterised working-class political behaviour in this
period.
This reading of mid-Victorian social and political relationships has
experienced ferocious attacks from historians in recent years in that
it is inadequate and simplistic, and at least one of the original formu-
lators of the labour aristocracy thesis has rejected it. [2 ] Critics of the
thesis propounded by Hobsbawm, Gray and others have drawn atten-
tion to both its socio-economic and political weaknesses. Generally,
the idea of periodising history in such an artificial manner is attacked
since very little change is detected in the language or practice of
working-class politics in this period. Periodisation, it is argued, is the
outcome of a misreading of Chartism. Only by viewing Chartism as
a movement of the class consciousness industrial proletariat could
the notion of a mid-Victorian lacuna in the political development of

81


-----

the working class be entertained. As Biagini and Reid put it in a
classic statement of the new revisionist history:

Our rethinking of post-chartist radicalism ... begins from the
assumption that popular politicking needs to be assessed in the
first instance within its own political context, rather than in
terms of what it 'ought' to have been, defined for example in
terms of its consistency with external norms of revolutionary
rhetoric or with teleogical models of historical development ....
Once we place mid- and late-Victorian working-class Liberal and
Labour activists back into their own political context in this way,
enough continuity in popular radicalism can be demonstrated to
make the social explanations of major changes unnecessary. [3 ]

Specific criticisms are also aimed at the fundamental props of the
labour aristocracy thesis. The existence of a privileged stratum within
the working class is considered to be more the product of the histor-
ical imagination than reality. Studies of earnings show that they were
never regular as all skilled workmen suffered periodic bouts of
unemployment and the only workers who could be guaranteed
employment during depressions were foremen and apprentices. [4 ]
Moreover, work on expenditure and savings patterns within the
working class emphasises that most workers were able to put some-
thing by for life cycle events, such as funerals, after meeting their
own personal expenses. [5 ] As to closer identification with the middle
classes research on marriage registers in this period has shown that
there was minimal mobility between working and middle class, and
that workers viewed raising themselves solely within the context of
the class they were a part of. Social aspirations operated round the
idea of independence rather than acceptance of middle-class lifestyles. [6 ]
Trade unions may have spoken the language of conciliation, but they
never exercised enough control over their members for this to have
had any bearing on industrial relations. Contrary to the Webbs' 'new
model' unionism, centralised control was a myth and the workshop
rather than the union was the focal point of collective bargaining in
the mid-Victorian period.? Politically, the working class operated
within the inherited framework of radical politics. Continuity rather
than change then best sums up this period in the history of the
working class. Indeed, as David Nicholls succinctly puts it in a
review of the new revisionist history: 'According to the revisionist
bible, eighteenth century radicalism begat Chartism, Chartism begat
popular liberalism, popular liberalism begat New Liberalism, and

82

_Interpretations_

New Liberalism begat the Labour Party'. [8 ]

The debate over the labour aristocracy was important as it created
new understandings of working-class attitudes and behaviour over a
wide range of socio-economic and political subjects, from employment
patterns, to leisure pursuits and popular politics. But no matter how
telling the criticisms of the thesis were they did not in general provide
a satisfactory alternative explanation as to how stabilisation and
political consensus were achieved. [9 ] What we were left with was a
picture of a fragmented and sectional working class whose lifestyles
and behavioural patterns were so diverse across the country that to
talk of class seemed a fruitless exercise. The stress on continuity
further confirmed the impression of socio-economic and political
stasis. But the historical project to correct the wilder explanatory
excesses of the labour aristocracy tended to obscure significant qual-
itative and quantitative changes taking place both in the composition,
and in the workplace and political culture, of the working class.
In the middle decades of the century, formerly powerful alternatives
to industrial capitalism, such as the co-operative societies of the
Owenites, the trade guilds of the builders' union, the Chartist land
banks, and so on, lost their appeal to the dispossessed. The legitimacy
of private property and the permanency of the industrial system was
accepted by Scottish and English workers alike. The precepts of the
moral economy of the first half of the nineteenth century which had
conditioned the political economy of the labour movement gave
way to a recognition of labour as a commodity, whose worth was
determined by the market rather than by custom and tradition.
There were also changes in the social relations of the workplace
and in working-class cultural values. The middle classes mounted
an impressive assault on the behaviourial patterns associated with
the pre-industrial order, particularly drinking and riotious assembly.
Although there had been attempts earlier to remould working-class
culture, particularly its rougher aspects, the mid-Victorian period
witnessed an intensification of effort on the part of the middle classes.
In the workplace, a more paternalist and welfare-orientated regime
was introduced by employers to modify the bitter and hostile rela-
tions which had developed in the 1830s and 1840s. These shifts in
social relations were concomitant with improvements in the standard
of living as real wages increased and brought with them a more benign
attitude among workers towards free market capitalism. Politically,
important changes were discerned in the conduct and language of
political struggle within the working class. Although the violence of
Chartism is exaggerated in some accounts of the 1840s, [10 ] there is no

83


-----

doubt that after 1850 working-class politics were more strongly-based
on prevailing ideology and working through mainstream institutional
channels as a means of resolving continuing socio-economic griev-
ances. John Hodge's description of the 1866 franchise demonstration
in Glasgow brilliantly captures the respectable and sectional face of
the newfound political practice of the workers. He recalled that: 'I
remember the tailors walking in this procession, all dressed with their
white shirts and their evening suits, and the other trades all marching
in the procession ... carrying models of their craft, which ... had
been made by their own hand' .[11 ] In the segmented political atmos-
phere of the decades after Chartism, the concern was less with _The_
_Rights of Man and more with the right of respectable working-class_
householders to share political power through the franchise.
These factors are of equal relevance to British workers north and
south of the border at this time, but there is also the specifically
Scottish changes which need to be considered. Economic restructuring
which began in the 1840s witnessed in these middle decades the
establishment of a mature industrial economy based on the integration
of coal, iron and shipbuilding. This transformation led to the demise
of more traditional forms of employment, such as handloom weaving,
and even newer occupations in textiles, such as cotton spinning, as
well as to a continuous haemorrhaging of labour from agriculture. As
the newer occupations were labour intensive, skilled, male and Prote-
stant, a masculine culture operating round the concerns and values
of the time-served man was emerging as the hegemonic force within
the working class, particularly in the west of Scotland. As we shall
see this led to the creation of a peculiarly Scottish political culture
somewhat at odds and, at times, in opposition with that prevailing
among the working class in England.
These changes are in need of explanation as they represent altered
forms of industrial, social and political consciousness compared with
those explicit in the radical and Chartist eras. However, in saying
this, it is important to recognise that in the process of re-composition
there existed old and new forms of production in industrial Scotland
and that led at times to contradictory patterns of political and
workplace behaviour. These contradictions allowed for the continuance
of a 'radical political tradition' to speak to contemporary concerns
regarding the distribution of power and wealth. [12 ] But, in spite of this
duality, the changing nature of the Scottish working class is unmis-
takable and it is this which provides the key to the process of stabil-
isation in the mid-Victorian decades.

###### Chapter 8

##### HEAVY INDUSTRY AND SOCIAL CHANGE, 1850-1880

The obvious starting point for understanding these changes is an
examination of the changing nature of the Scottish economy and its
impact on the occupational profile of the country. As we have seen
prior to 1850 the industrial structure was dependent on a narrow
range of textile industries, particularly cotton. This had a retarding
effect on the primary and secondary sectors of the economy, as did
the frequent economic crises which resulted from overcommitment to
a single group of industries. However, with the advent of the railways
the heavy industries in the 1840s began to take off; a phenomenon
assisted by the inventiveness of the Scots, as well as copious amounts
of cheap labour, fuel and energy. Between 1850 and 1880 these foun-
dations were built on to create a broad industrially-based economy.
These decades witnessed the mushroom growth of shipbuilding on
the Clyde and the equally impressive growth of the coal and iron
industries.
The coal industry experienced an impressive surge of growth with
output doubling from 7.4m tons to 14.9m tons between 1854 and
1870, and employment from 32 969 workers to 46 984 in the same
period. Most of the production was at this time located in the west
of Scotland and the region employed around 74 per cent of the
workforce in 1870. [13 ] Most of the mined coal was destined for non-
domestic consumption with the export market and iron industry
consuming between them 40 per cent of output in this period. [14 ]
Capitalising on Neilson's invention of the hot blast furnace, Scottish
ironmasters were producing the cheapest pig iron in the world.
Output of pig iron increased from 797 000 tons in 1854 to a peak of
1206 000 in 1869-70. [15 ] These developments were crucial to the
growth of the shipbuilding industry which saw the Clyde's share of
British shipbuilding employment grow from only 3 per cent in 1831

85


-----

to 21 per cent (and that of Scotland to 26 per cent) by 1871. In that
year the Clyde accounted for 48 per cent of the shipping tonnage
launched from British yards. [16 ] The growth of engineering comple-
mented developments in shipbuilding and other transport industries,
particularly the railways. The Springburn district of Glasgow became
the world's leading manufacturer of locomotives. Textiles were still
important as an employer of labour, particularly of women. By the
1850s the spread of power-loom weaving brought about the demise
of handlooms in all but the fanciest aspects of the trade.
The structural changes taking place in the west of Scotland have
tended to dominate accounts of the country's economic history. This
has obscured the fact that other parts of Scotland were undergoing a
similar period of transition. Aberdeen's transition to industrialisation
was propelled like many parts of Scotland by the expansion of textiles;
however, by 1850 cotton production had collapsed with 'thousands
of hands ... thrown out of employment' resulting in 'an exodus ...
which was almost to nullify the natural increase of population for
the next ten years' Y Industrial collapse was only reversed by the
growth of the herring and white fishing industries and granite pro-
duction.18 By diversifying into new products the Aberdeen economy
enjoyed a resurgence and greater prosperity. Dundee adopted the
opposite course and as a result saw its economy develop a remarkably
high dependence on coarse textiles, particularly flax and jute. Textile
firms employed 41550 workers in 1867, most of them women, which
represented more than 25 per cent of the city's total population. [19 ]
The massive surge in economic growth in the third quarter of the
nineteenth century was in the main export led. Two million tons of
mined coal was exported annually between 1865 and 1869. The
development of the iron industry was even more determined by export
markets. Between 1830 and 1870 Scotland, although only supplying
on average 25 per cent of British output of pig iron, was responsible
for between 50 to 90 per cent of British pig iron exports. [20 ] In the
engineering industry recurring economic crisis was overcome by
diversification of product line and by selling in overseas markets. [21 ]
Glasgow's economy was more dependent on overseas trade than any
other British region. The reliance on export markets had the disad-
vantage of making Scottish manufacturing industry sensitive to shifts
in world demand. Shipbuilding suffered seven major cycles averaging
seven to nine years between 1822 and 1879.[22 ] Given the integrated
economic structure that had developed in the west of Scotland cyclical
depressions in shipbuilding had serious knock-on effects on related

86


-----

_Heavy Industry and Social Change_

industries. Burghs such as Dundee and Paisley which were reliant on
a single industry suffered disproportionately in economic downswings.
The collapse of the Paisley shawl trade devastated the town in 1857,
as did the repeated cyclical depressions in Dundee. [23 ]
The relative success of Scottish industry at this time has overshad-
owed the fact that much of the manufacturing base was made up of
small units of production. Rodger, in his study of mid-Victorian
Scottish industry, shows that half the firms in urban areas in this
period employed fewer that five workers and three out of every four
firms less than nine. Only 10 per cent of Scottish firms employed
more than twenty workers. The largest firms were in textiles with a
mean workforce of 662. However, he also notes that 60 per cent of
Scotland's industrial workforce was concentrated in plants of a
hundred or more workers. [24 ] The duality of the industrial structure
in Scotland in mid-century was, therefore, evident, and this had some
bearing on the divisions between workers: a phenomenon we will
examine later in the chapter.
However, regardless of the size of enterprise, the rapid expansion
of the Scottish economy increased the demand for labour, which
became insatiable in times of economic boom. The number of metal
workers in Scotland increased from 60 800 in 1851 to 210 400 in
1901, an increase of 346 per cent, as did the number in mining from
48 100 to 127 900, an increase of 266 per cent, in the same period.
There were similar gains in other branches of industry with the
exception of textiles which lost 67 000 jobs over the second half of
the nineteenth century. [25 ] The rise in industrial employment more
than compensated for the decline in agriculture, which saw its share
of the total workforce fall from around 30 per cent in 1851 to just
over 19 per cent in 1881. The Strathclyde region showed the largest
fall of those working in agriculture from just over 16 per cent of the
total working population in 1851 to 7.4 per cent thirty years later.
Agriculture was only significant as an employer of labour in the rural
Borders, Grampian and Highland regions. [26 ]
Between the major cities there were contrasting patterns of
employment, as there were for men and women. Industrial employ-
ment during the period 1851 to 1881 was the main source of income
for Glasgow and Dundee workers with three-quarters in the case of
Glasgow and astonishingly nearly nine-tenths in the case of Dundee
located in these occupations. However, even in Edinburgh and Aber-
deen, two cities with large service sectors, two-thirds of male workers
were employed in industry, although only around a third of females.27

87


-----

Female workers in Scotland were predominantly found in four occupa-
tional groups: agriculture, domestic service, clothing and textiles. [28 ] Most
of them tended to be young and single with few married women in
employment. Although this discounts the number of married women
employed in casual or home work, official participation rates in Scot-
land were some 4 per cent below that for England and Wales in 1871.[29 ]
The expansion of the economy and the labour market, as well as
the changing character of occupations had important political and
social implications. Much of the industrial and political protest prior
to 1850 had centred on groups of workers deskilled and impoverished
by industrial change such as handloom weavers. The widespread
use of the power-loom in the 1850s witnessed the destruction of
handloom weaving as an occupation and the absorption of weavers
in other forms of industrial employment. Male cotton spinners, who
had formerly been at the frontier of technological change, found
themselves outnumbered by women as employers increasingly met
internal and external competition by cheapening labour costs. By the
1880s two-thirds of the workforce was female with the number of
male workers having declined by 50 per cent between 1871 and 1881;
a development which was replicated in the woollen industry of the
Scottish border counties. [30 ]The former militancy of the cotton spinners
was broken in this new sexual division of labour. Of those workers
associated with pre-industrial modes of organisation only the colliers
remained. As we will see, they continued to prove militant in times
of rising prosperity, but the militancy tended to be confined to the
large and integrated coal and iron combines such as the Dixon enter-
prises of Lanarkshire. Most miners worked in small pits with the
average figure for west Lanarkshire in 1873 being 136.9 men per pit,
although in districts such as Old Monklands in 1864 it was as low
as 45.6 men per pit. The paternalism of the coalowners in these small
enterprises proved a barrier to effective union mobilisation and it was
not until the 1880s that a workforce of around 300 became common
for a colliery in the west of Scotland. [31 ] Therefore, as the labour force
changed in composition the threats to the industrial order diminished.
###### It assumed a permanency among the workers as they became attuned
to bargaining using economic, rather than moral, criteria, indeed, by
'playing the market'. [32 ]
The expansion of the labour market and the rising prosperity of
the Scottish economy in this period provided important clues as to
the forces promoting social and political stability. For consensus to
develop there needs to be tangible evidence that society has the

sustained ability to deliver an increasing amount of goods and services
to a growing population. If the experience of the Soviet Union or
Britain in the 1970s is anything to go by it is the provision of larger
parcels of consumption, rather than broad and binding policy agree-
ments between corporate powers, which generates the basis of stable
social relationships. The first phase of industrialisation saw many
workers experience a decline, or at least stagnation, in living standards,
a phenomenon which fuelled much of the industrial and political
protest of the 1830s and 1840s. The middle decades of the century
saw things improve for the broad mass of Scottish workers and their
families as 'investment after 1850 was capital saving and labour
using, resulting in a steady growth in employment incomes'Jl

Although the data are somewhat fragmented and tend only to
cover wage rates rather than actual earnings, as well as making no
allowance for unemployment or broken time, which was thought to
affect the wages of one in four Scottish workers, there seems to have
been a substantial improvement across industry in money wages.
During the 1848 depression colliers' wages had reached a nadir of

lOs weekly, [34 ] but by 1863 wages averaged 4s to 4s 9d per day in the
Glasgow area, and by 1880 hewers were receiving around 25s 3d per
week at a time of falling prices. [35 ] In the more skilled trades wages
were much higher than in mining. Keith Burgess notes that building
wages in Scotland reached parity with England in the 1850s; a factor
which eroded the differential advantage Scottish employers had over
English by as much as 15-25 per cent. [36 ] Indeed, between 1843 and
1880 stonemasons in the Glasgow area saw their money wages
increase by around 35s, or 230 per cent, for a reduced working week
of 43 hoursY Engineering and shipbuilding workers also experienced
rises in wages. According to the Amalgamated Society of Engineers
(ASE), average minimum wages increased on a much reduced working
week from 18-34s in 1851 for 63-57 hours of work, to 22-36s in
1866 for 60-56 hours, and in 1880 to 24-36s for 54 hours. [38 ] Data for
the Glasgow area over the same period tend to confirm these estimates
as weekly rates for fitters were said to be 28s 9d in 1866 for 60 hours
of work. Fourteen years later the respective figure was 31s 9d for 54
hours, although workers on piece could earn more. Shipyard riveters
on the Clyde were earning 25s lOd in 1866 for a 60 hour week, but
this rose sharply in 1880 to 40s for those on piece, although the hours
of work were unspecified. [39 ] Even among certain sections of the
unskilled money wages were rising. Pan men in the sugar refining in-
dustry were earning as much as skilled workers, with wages estimated

89


-----

to be 30-40s per week in 1866; and machine men in paper manu-
facture in 1863 were getting 19-21s, although in both cases official
reports do not indicate the hours worked. [40 ]

Increased income afforded a lifestyle for many workers which
allowed for greater variety in the consumption of food, entertainment
and travel. A study of the expenditure patterns of a Dundee engineer
in 1864-65, shows that his earnings were sufficient to fund a lifestyle
which included luxuries such as fruit and sweets, refreshments,
shows, newspapers, journals and books, and a fair amount of travel
by cab and rail. [41 ] That prosperity was shared by workers outside of the
main cities. A Hawick tweed manufacturer, C. J. Wilson, in evidence
to the Royal Commission on Labour in 1891, claimed that local
workpeople saved with local building societies, had shares in the
co-operative societies of the area, and worked assidiously on their
allotments. [42 ] Perhaps, as a consequence of the rising standard of
living and improved economic opportunities at home emigration
slowed down in the early 1860s and late 1870s.[43 ]

However, although earnings of a broad range of trades were
increasing over the third quarter of the nineteenth century, there
remained important vertical divisions among wage earners based on
the nature of their economic activity, geographical location and
gender. According to Dudley Baxter's survey of national income in
1867, 70 per cent of working Scots, predominantly young, female and
unskilled, earned less than £30 per annum. [44 ] Differentials between
the unskilled and skilled were higher in Scotland than in England.
Labourers in the Glasgow building trades earned 57 per cent of the
skilled rate, whereas in London they earned 66 per cent. [45 ] These dif-
ferentials were also found to exist between major urban centres.
Many of the trades in Aberdeen, such as textiles and fishing, paid
low wages in comparison to Clydeside metal trades, but they were
substantially above those in Dundee. [46 ] Aberdeen carpenters and
joiners averaged 27s 7d in the early 1890s compared to 36s 1.5d for
Glasgow. Inter-city differentials mirrored national ones. Scottish
workers were thought to earn 16-19 per cent less than English
workers in the 1860sY As a measure of improvement the first wage
census of 1886 saw this narrow to 94.8 per cent of the English rate.
However, it was still the case that in the cotton, shipbuilding, con-
struction and printing trades Scottish employees earned substantially
less than their English equivalents, while in engineering and carpet
manufacture there was little difference, but in coalmining and linen
manufacture wages were a trifle higher. [48 ]

_Heavy Industry and Social Change_

While things were improving, the Scottish economy was still char-
acterised by low wages; a point noted by Edward Young, the US
Consul in Edinburgh, who remarked that the world dominance of
Clyde shipbuilders was due less to technical superiority and more to
'the low rate of wages'. [49 ] However, this point was made with even
more force when the level of women's pay is compared to men's. As
women were seen as dependants rather than breadwinners, which
was the case in many households, they were thought to need less to
keep them than men. Women's work was, thus, synonymous with
low pay. By the end of the nineteenth century the average wage for a
woman was still only 42 per cent of the male average. Even in skilled
trades women earned less than men for doing the same job. The
highest paid skilled women in the Edinburgh printing trades earned
20s a week, whereas the lowest paid unskilled men and warehouse
hands earned between 15s and 21s. [50 ] In spite of these generally low
levels of pay there existed an income hierarchy in female occupations.
Female cotton spinners earned on average 19s 6d a week in 1861,
while female jute spinners a paltry 7s 3d. 5 [1 ]In the Paisley thread trade
a copwinder received 14s 8d a week in 1878 compared to 12s 6d for
a spooler. [52 ] These differentials were the source of social and work-
place divisions. As a female spinner in the Dundee jute trade put it:
'weavers thought themselves somethin', aye and winders tae ... they
never looked at us ... they thought they were somethin' special. ...
They used to walk past you as if you were something low and they
were "it"'. [53 ]

Therefore, not all Scots shared in the economic boom of the mid-
Victorian decades and the system of hierarchically determined rewards
created social divisions within the ranks of workers. Indeed, 2 7 per
cent of Glasgwegians in gainful employment earned around a pound
a week, and from this meagre sum they were expected to feed, clothe
and house their families. This was less than it cost the City Poor
House or Prison per week for an equivalent number of inmates in their
care. 5[4 ] Low wage levels obviously affected the type and condition of
housing that was available for renting. The first reliable guide to
this question was provided by the 1861 census. The data showed that
one-room houses comprised 34 per cent of the housing stock of
Scotland, and that a further 3 7 per cent consisted of two rooms.
Thus, in 1861, 71 per cent of Scottish housing consisted of not more
than two rooms, and housed 64 per cent of the population. [55 ] The
average size of a one-room house in Edinburgh was only 14 by 11.5
feet, but, in spite of this, 226 000 families inhabited single rooms. 5[6 ]

91

The amenities available to tenants were also poor. In 1861, with
91664 inhabitants, Dundee had only five WCs, and three of them
were in hotelsY All water in Dundee was drawn from wells of which
the chief, the Lady Well, was heavily polluted by the local slaughter-
house. 58 The situation was not much better in Dundee's more
prosperous neighbour. As late as 1865 the city engineer, Robert
Anderson, stated that two-thirds of Aberdeen had no sewers, and
each water well in the city had to supply 400 families. [59 ] Conditions
in Scotland were summed up by one contemporary essayist, who
wrote in 1866 that:

Sanitary arrangements [are] of the most defective description ....
The absence of conveniences ... is a great preventive of that
thorough cleanliness and purity ... as a consequence the atmos-
phere is foully tainted, and rendered almost unendurable by its
loathsomeness at those periods when offal and nuisance require
to be deposited on the streets. [60 ]

Not surprisingly, overcrowded and cramped low amenity housing
impacted itself on the health of the urban working class. Infant
mortality rates were appallingly high in Scotland with 42 per cent of
all deaths in Glasgow in the age cohort 0-5 in 1861. [61 ] Children born
in one room houses were the most vulnerable. Of all children in
Glasgow who died in 1861 before the age of five, 32 per cent were
born or living in 'single ends', while only 2 per cent were in five
roomed houses. [62 ]The most common killer was gastric illnesses, but in
truth the majority died because their mothers were too undernour-
ished to feed them properly. This underlines the fact that epidemics
and poor health were not simply the result of bad housing and
defective drinking supplies. Part of the problem lay with food and
drink adulteration, but conditions in the workplace also had a major
impact on health. A study of Tranent, near Edinburgh, in the 1840s
found that mining, because of the dirt and dust, was an unhealthy
trade. Out of 35 colliers' families, the average age of death for the
male head of household was 34, while the average age of death for
male factory workers was over 50. [63 ]

The poverty was made worse by the continuous flood of people
looking for work in the cities and towns. The working or occupied
population of Glasgow nearly doubled from 123 052 in 1841 to
233 982 in 1881; while in the same period Dundee grew even more
spectacularly from 24 785 to 69 150, and Edinburgh from 57 626 to
104 985. [64 ] The influx showed a different pattern to that of the first

half of the nineteenth century. Nearly half of all migrants to the west
of Scotland in the decades 1851 to 1871 were from rural areas in
lowland Scotland, but the most homogeneous group came from the
Scottish Highlands. From 54 000 in 1851 the number grew to 79 000
twenty years later, of which over 70 per cent were settled in the
Glasgow district. [65 ] The Irish continued to settle in Scotland in large
numbers, but the tidal wave of the 1840s had began to slow, and
there was a shift in the religious denomination of the incomers. By
1871 the number of Irish-born in Scotland stood at 207 700, of
which 76 per cent were located in the west of Scotland. Although this
represented only 13 per cent of the total population of Scotland,
Anthony Slaven argues that 'Somewhere between a quarter to a third
of the inhabitants ... must have been of Irish extraction'. [66 ] Moreover,
half of all Irish immigrants to Scotland in the period 1851 to 1881
were Protestant,[67 ]although in the quinquenium 1876-81 the figure was
much higher at 83.2 per cent. Of these incoming Irish Protestants,
58.7 per cent came from the four most staunch Ulster counties-
Antrim, Armagh, Down and Tyrone. [68 ] Reflecting the new pattern of
Irish immigration was the establishment by 1878 of 100 Orange
Lodges in Glasgow with a membership of 15 000 out of a total of
90 000 for England and Scotland. [69 ]
Irish Protestants, through patronage and the right of the foreman to
hire and fire, found their way into skilled occupations in shipbuilding
and engineering; however, the Catholic Irish remained confined to
unskilled low paid employment. In 1851, 52 per cent of the unskilled
workers in Greenock were Irish-born and this was still the case forty
years on; in Coatbridge in 1861 around 60 per cent of unskilled metal
workers were lrish.7° Employers generally colluded in this practice or
adopted a position of benign neglect. But in some enterprises an
openly hostile attitude to Catholic Irish workers was displayed. The
iron and coal magnate, William Baird, closed his Gartsherrie works
in Lanarkshire on Sundays to allow workers to attend church and
encouraged strong Orange sympathies among them. [71 ]
The third quarter of the nineteenth century provided rising living
standards for many workers, although as we have seen the young,
women and ethnic groups were by-passed in the distribution of
rewards. Poverty and poor social conditions remained a way of life
for far too many in Scotland, however, the rise in employment
incomes put respectability within the grasp of increasing numbers of
workers and their families. This was to have an important impact on
the cultural ethos of the Scottish working class.

 RESPECTABILITY AND THE
##### SCOTTISH WORKING CLASSES,

#### 1850-1880

Respectability was based on a series of social and economic supports
including regular earnings and employment, sobriety and thrift.
While the fluctuating fortunes of the Scottish economy could not
always guarantee the former, there seems clear evidence that many
skilled workers and their families subscribed to some negotiated
form of the latter. Respectability can be said to have been negotiated
because, although nurtured by the middle classes as part of a cultural
and religious onslaught on the values of the working class, particu-
larly those associated with the older, rougher culture of pre-industrial
society, it was modified in the light of the realities of working-class
life. The drive towards respectability arose out of middle-class fears
over slum life and the integrity of the working-class family, as well as
the desire to promote greater standards of public order, and this led
to a barrage of initiatives designed to promote self-help and self-
improvement schemes. However, it also involved concessions 'from
the people above', such as the building of libraries and public parks,
and, more politically, the passing by the state of legislation designed
to improve the economic and political position of the working class.
Middle-class concerns were to some extent not surprising as the
depravity surrounding the culture of drink reached the point where
on New Year's Day in Aberdeen 'old and middle aged men and women
and boys and girls [were] falling about in a state of intoxication at
two o'clock in the day'.7[2 ] In Glasgow, a team of investigators working
for the North _British Mail estimated that in the old city centre there_
were 200 brothels and 150 shebeens in operation in the early 1870s.
These were split into 'respectable' shebeens in which only the licens-
ing laws were violated, the 'disreputable' which were frequented by

94

_Respectability and the Scottish Working Classes_

the criminal fraternity, and the 'wee' shebeens 'on the stair head' .[73 ]
Moreover, the riotous behaviour surrounding the monarch's birthday
continued after 1850. An example of this was the riot which broke
out in Dundee on Queen Victoria's birthday in 1853 which led to the
sacking of the town hall and the breaking of every window in the
High Street. What, asked an editorial in the Dundee Advertiser, can
you expect if 'you coop up hordes of human beings in narrow pesti-
lential closes, hemmed in on all sides by whisky shops, pawn shops'
without regard to their 'social condition' .7[4 ]

The response to this kind of social pandemonium was swift and
within twelve years the journeyman engineer, John Sturrock, could
enjoy a performance of the Artillery Band in Dundee's Baxter Park
on the monarch's birthday without a 'hint of the disorder that
coloured earlier celebrations of this event' .7[5 ]The eradication of unruly
and riotous behaviour involved the middle classes in the promotion
of acceptable and respectable behaviour and an obvious starting
point in this process of remoulding working class culture was the
reform of drinking habits.
In this endeavour middle-class philanthropists and the state built
on the foundations established in the 1830s and 1840s among skilled
workers and Chartists. The labour movement in Scotland, unlike
that in England, had introduced the practice of holding meetings in
coffee shops rather than public houses at an early date. [76 ] Coopers used
the fines and footings collected from apprentices and strangers, pre-
viously for the purpose of financing alcoholic excess, for respectable
'annual soirees, pleasure excursions, vocal and instrumental events' .7[7 ]
This change also applied to the loosely organised trades councils which
emerged in the post-1850 period. The Edinburgh Trades Council
(ETC) met in a coffee shop from its inception until 1867 and, then for
the next twenty years, in a temperance hotel.7[8 ] Trade union leaders
railed against the demon drink as harmful to the interests of the trade
and to the labour movement in general. The Boilermakers' Society
complained that 'stopping off drinking is the greatest evil that our
trade and society has to contend against'; [79 ] a view underscored by
the Ironfounders' Society which claimed that all non-unionists were
by definition, mostly corrupt, tending to be 'drunkards, idlers and
very often improvident men'. [80 ] Employers, anxious to maintain
production and reduce absenteeism, and the state, concerned over
questions of public order, were also enthusiastic supporters of tem-
perance. By the 1860s, temperance lodges were established at Calder,
Gartsherrie and Calderbank ironworks, and legislation in the form

95


-----

of the Forbes Mackenzie Act of 1853 brought in Sunday closing of
pubs, though not of hotels. [81 ]
The rhetoric of union leaders was supplemented by initiatives from
temperance societies. The Independent Order of Good Templars
(IOGT) formed in 1869 and the Independent Order of Rechabites
(lOR) were the largest organisations of this kind in Scotland, with
the former's Airdrie branch being the largest temperance lodge in the
world. [82 ] However, as Callum Brown notes, by this time the leadership
of the temperance movement had been 'appropriated by the middle
classes and the churches' [83 ] and the links it enjoyed with radical poli-
tics were severed by the change of leaders. Nevertheless, the impact
of the societies could be electric. The arrival in 1870 of the IOGT in
Aberdeen brought a membership of 4000 and 23 lodges within a
year. [84 ] Bands of Hope, mixing religion and temperance, were set up
in the 1870s to target children and young people. In Glasgow, the
Abstainers' Union established the highly popular Saturday night
concerts from 1854 to 1914, which attracted the best professional
performers from the British music hall and international opera stars,
while the smaller societies, such as the Temperance Crusaders, ran
their own successful amateur concerts. [85 ]
Outside of temperance reform, voluntary societies addressed them-
selves to a wide range of social problems, but the integrity of the
working-class family and, in particular, the position of women and
young females was at the forefront of middle-class concerns. Domestic
training for girls was written into the school curriculum after the
passing of the Education (Scotland) Act of 1872, not only because of
the middle class's need for servants, but also, as Helen Corr points
out, because it was 'feared that the working class family in towns
and cities was falling into a state of physical deterioration through
poor housing, bad health and moral decay'. [86 ] Outside the classroom
organisations like the Aberdeen Ladies Union (ALU), which had as
its object 'the bringing together of all workers for the welfare of
women and girls in Aberdeen', worked among the half-timers in the
textile mills. The ALU attempted to extend a form of social control
over the behaviour of the mill girls by raising 'the moral standard in
all ways possible'. This was to be done through the establishment of
'lily bands', whose main social activities included reading circles,
needlework and family worship. Within two years of its foundation
in 1883 the ALU had 300 mill girls enrolled in 'lily bands'. For older
females 'lily band' evening classes were established along the same
lines and they had around 250 members in the late 1880s.87 Eleanor

_Respectability and the Scottish Working Classes_

Gordon, in her study of the Dundee jute industry, noted that several
middle-class voluntary associations developed in the city to instruct
mill girls in 'dressmaking, millinery, cooking, laundry', and so on. [88 ]
###### It would appear that as far as the middle class was concerned the
crisis of the working-class family was to be resolved by strengthening
the Victorian association of women with the domestic sphere and
men with the world of work, even in places such as Dundee where a
high percentage of households were dependent on the earnings of
women. [89 ]

Upon these social constructs a system of patriarchy emerged in
both the workplace and the wider society. Although the role of
patriarchy has not been fully explored in the context of Scottish
workplace relations, its existence points to another source of cultural
fragmentation within the working class, and, as Patrick Joyce suggests,
to the creation of 'all sorts of understandings with employers (a "boss"
in his sphere as was the worker in his home and work functions)' .[90 ]
Women's work, therefore, where it was not considered irrelevant, was
unrespectable. The mixing of the sexes was considered undesirable
even by pro-labour publications. The Chartist Circular claimed that
factory work 'degraded and contaminated' female workers; the
_Glasgow Sentinel declared in 1860 that: 'The employment of women_
at occupations where it is necessary they should be mixed up with
men is not desirable'. [91 ]
Attempts to restructure the working-class family and to maintain
the subordination of women in and out of the workplace were linked
to the need to provide healthy and 'rational' recreation, particularly
as a counterweight to the public house. By refocusing working-class
leisure pursuits round the family a more respectable and less rough
culture might emerge. The public parks movement was one element
in this strategy. Dundee's Baxter Park, named after one of the city's
leading jute manufacturers, was constructed with the surface objective
of providing 'the working population [of Dundee] with a means of
recreation and enjoyment after their hard labour and honest industry';
but also with the more discrete objective of dissolving class tensions
by providing a 'common ground, where all the inhabitants of that
large and busy town may meet in mutual acknowledgement of their
dependence of the one upon the other'. [92 ] Cricket and rowing were
also promoted with similar social objectives as alternatives to the
rough culture and enjoyed some popularity among workers. Neal
Tranter's research on the social origins of organised sport in and
around Stirlingshire and Clackmannanshire shows that in the years

###### 97


-----

1880-83 skilled workers and the middle classes made up just over 80
per cent of cricketers, whereas football, athletics and quoiting drew
players from almost an exclusively skilled backgrounds. [93 ] Interestingly,
the research shows that down to the 1880s active participants in
organised sport were rarely drawn from the ranks of the unskilled or
semi-skilled. Even among football players only one in ten was an
agricultural or semi-skilled worker, while at the level of club office-
bearer public service and professional occupations dominated. [94 ]
The social purpose of these sporting ventures was fairly explicit.
Wishaw Cricket Club was formed in 1856 with the express desire to
'draw the young men away from the public houses and other evil
devices' and to promote more social harmony. [95 ] Their organisational
structure also reflected the class basis of society and reinforced the
superior status of the middle classes in their capacity as office-bearers.
Sharing this objective, Volunteer Companies, established during the
French invasion threat of 1859, survived to bring different social
classes together. [96 ] Far from blind to the opportunities the Volunteers
provided for reinforcing employer authority, firms set up their own
branches. In the integrated coal and iron firms of Lanarkshire,
Volunteer Companies were set up in which the managers were the
officers, the foremen the NCOs, and the colliers the privates; a hier-
archical structure which reproduced the authority relations of the
workplace. [97 ]
Regardless of origin, leisure pursuits had to be afforded and this
necessitated a commitment to the virtues of thrift. The mid-Victorian
decades witnessed the growth of savings banks and functional co-
operative societies, divorced from the socially transforming role
assigned to them by Owen, as institutions of working-class self-help.
Savings banks had a preponderance of stonemasons, joiners and
engineers among their depositors, although very few, according to
Levitt and Smout, were 'unskilled urban labourers either in Scotland
or England' .[98 ] However, female factory workers in Paisley were the
main contributors to the assets of the Paisley Savings Bank, which
saw its deposits grow from £60 000 in 1854 to upwards of £90 000
in 1871. [99 ] Similarly, those workers involved in the co-operative
movement came from a wide-range of trades, although the artisan or
'skilled class' predominated. [100 ] The Bannockburn society was com-
posed mainly of 'carpet weavers and pitmen'; the Kilmarnock society
set up in 1860 was the work of 'handloom carpet weavers'- a 'class
of men esteemed for their intelligence and thrift' - and engineers; and
the Paisley society was found on the initiative of groups of weavers. [101 ]

_Respectability and the Scottish Working Classes_

Religion was another arm in the weaponry of the culture of order;
a process which had begun with Thomas Chalmers' social work in
Glasgow in the 1820s. The skilled worker had always figured promi-
nently in the congregations of the established church, but the
Disruption of 1843 in the Church of Scotland over the question of
patronage had led many to leave the fold. However, this did not lead
to a diminution in church attendance as the rivalry with the Free
Church led to a furious church building programme. A study of eight
Glasgow churches in the period 1845-65 showed that three-quarters
of 1330 members of the Church of Scotland and over half the 2663
members of the dissenting churches were mainly skilled working
class. [102 ] The United Presbyterians and the Free Church increasingly
drew their ministers from the ranks of the petty bourgeoisie and
skilled workers. [103 ] For those outside the ranks of the skilled stratum

       - the 'godless poor' - a whole series, of admittedly partially successful,
initiatives were promoted by the churches. The range of this cultural
assault can be guaged from the activities of St Mary's Free Church in
the working-class district of Govan, Glasgow. By the end of the 1880s
St Mary's had 1137 children enrolled in its Sunday School, 493 in
Bible class, 155 Sunday School teachers, a company of the Boys
Brigade numbering 58, Gospel Temperance meetings with 420 mem-
bers, a Penny Savings Bank, several branches of the YMCA, and 292
Home Mission workers. [104 ] If that was not enough there were congre-
gational district visitors, 'Bible Women', the Salvation Army from the
late 1870s, Mothers' Kitchen Prayer Meetings, and Medical Missions.
There were also missions to seamen, railwaymen, and shipyard
workers, as well as evangelical 'tents' for the poor in major urban
centres. [105 ] Peter Taylor, an engineer, recalled in his autobiography,
that the local minister, Dr Andrew Bonar, frequently addressed the
workers of Barclay and Curle, Whiteinch, Glasgow, during their
dinner hour. [106 ]

Callum Brown has also pointed to the 'controlled' religious revivals
of the third quarter of the nineteenth century led by the Free and
United Presbyterian Churches, [107 ] which contrasted with the millenia!
rivalism occurring in Lanarkshire colliery villages, Perth factories and
Shotts ironworks of the 1830s and 1840s. One at Kilsyth in 1839
paralysed a whole community as 'the web became nothing to a
weaver, nor the forge to the blacksmith, nor his bench to the carpen-
ter, nor the furrow to the ploughman. They forsook all to crowd the
churches and prayer meetings'. [108 ] Revivalism was, therefore, stripped
of its class identity and spread under its more respectable cloak to

99

the middle- and working-class families of Edinburgh and Glasgow
by the 1870s; a high point of which was the Moody and Sankey
revival of 1874. Quasi-religious organisations further enhanced con-
tacts between the skilled workers and other social groupings. By
1879 the Masonic Order in Scotland was estimated to have just over
69 000 members in lodges affiliated to the Grand Order and over a
thousand dormant lodges. With its distinguished patrons, including
members of the royal family, and high entry fees and annual subscrip-
tions, the Order had strong artisan and middle class membership. [109 ]
However, perhaps, the main tool of middle-class social engineering
was education. As we have seen industrialisation, with its demand
for child labour, had a baneful effect on education. Attendance was
intermittent and the peak years for boys seemed to have been
between the ages of seven and ten. The 1872 Education Act was
passed to address this problem by introducing compulsory schooling
for working-class children between the ages of five and thirteen,
although those reaching the fifth grade before thirteen could gain
exemption after the age of ten. The impact of the legislation was
profound. While in 1857 only around half of Glasgow's children
attended school, and only a third of Catholics of school age, by the
end of the century attendance was fairly universal and illiteracy had
been virtually wiped out for both sexes. [110 ]However, the schools were
not only transmitters of literacy and numeracy skills, but also agents
of discipline and order. School rules included the injunction that:
'there should be sustained quietness and instantaneous obedience' . [111 ]
Should the injunction fail, the tawse was always on hand to enforce
silence. The habits instilled in the children in the classroom were
designed to make them amenable to the disciplines of the work
rhythm of the factory and workshops, as well as to the authority of
those above them. Increasingly imperial and military considerations
came to dominate the political agenda in schools. Military drill was
taught by ex-soldiers, who were often employed as janitors, and it
was added to in time by emphasis on musical drill and gymnastics,
all thought by the Educational News to encourage in pupils:

The habit of acting in concert, of strict obedience to the word
of command, of deference to authority, of military precision, all
contribute to the formation of a character, in which sense of
duty, esprit de corps, respect for authority, and affection for, and
loyalty to, school, are conspicuous .... pupils imbued with such
a spirit will go out into the world well prepared to play their
part as good citizens. [112 ]

100


-----

Education also reinforced, as we have noted above, the gender divi-
sions of the wider society with girls being educated in domestic skills,
while the boys were fitted to take part in the world of work.
The cultural attack by the middle class on the disorderly habits of
working-class life was complemented by the growing moderation
and restraint shown by workers and their families. If the response
by the latter had not been positive, the overtures from 'the people
above' would have come to nothing. By responding in such a sure
manner to values such as sobriety and thrift, the working class could
have been said to have been embourgeoised. However, the values were
sufficiently ambiguous to be open to a variety of interpretations. As
R. Q. Gray points out, 'these values and norms were reinterpreted
within the upper working class's social world: their meaning might
change as they became embroidered in distinctive manual working
class institutions'. [113 ] The meaning skilled workers attached to these
'values and norms' derived from their social and economic concerns
and fears; in that sense they could be described as functional.
Temperance made sense in as much as marginal income and working
time lost in drinking endangered the family as a viable social unit and
one's life chances. Indeed, the success of the temperance societies
lay less in their promotion by employers, and more because they not
only offered spiritual and moral guidance, but also a range of welfare
benefits and a form of recreation which was more family orientated
than that provided by the public house. Under the impact of shorter
hours, particularly from the 1870s, and rising incomes there was a
cultural shift towards the family and home life; a development
encouraged by bargaining round the concept of the 'family wage'. A
thrifty worker made it possible for his wife to remain at home and
to open avenues for improved education for his children. Savings also
ensured survival during periods of distress and illness in a pre-wel-
fare society, as well as allowing the worker to set aside some money
for the buying and replacement of lost or worn out tools, and to pay
the rent, which in Scotland was collected on a yearly or half-yearly
basis. Finally, thrift provided a measure of independence, which
David Kirkwood, of 'Red Clydeside' fame, defined in the words of
father, a skilled worker, as:

Not being starved, not being homeless, not being in debt. It
meant, above all, not being thrown on the parish [which] ...
was to be cast into the bottomless pit .... The glorious privilege
of being independent was no mere poet's fancy. It was the very
marrow of life. [114 ]

101


-----

Following what Kirkwood has to say on the matter, the material
basis of respectability should not be lost sight of. As Hamish Fraser
points out, a 'respectable' man in an economy based on reputation and
trust had a much better chance of finding employment, obtaining
credit, receiving a character reference, finding an apprenticeship for
his son, and getting a decent house. [115 ]
Although modified by the realities of working-class life and open
to diverse and ambiguous meanings, there is little doubt that the
promotion of respectability by the middle classes and the subscrip-
tion to its underlying values by workers went some way to encour-
age greater understanding between the various social strata in
Scottish society. As we have seen, temperance was from the outset an
alliance between the petty bourgeoisie and the working class. Its
basic premise was that working-class poverty was the result of drink,
rather than the inadequacies of the free market economy, and these
assumptions were shared by the politically conscious members of the
working class, and, at a later date, by socialists such as Keir Hardie.
Intellectualising poverty in this way individualised the problem and
encouraged ideas of self-help or self-improvement. Although primarily
associated with the voluntary institutions, such as Mechanics
Institutes, mutual self-improvement initiatives also took place at the
segmented workplace level. Peter Taylor recalled, while working at
Blackwood and Gordon, shipbuilders and engineers, Paisley, setting-
up a Mutual Improvement Association among the apprentices. The
Association's twenty members met in Taylor's mother's kitchen, where
they discussed all sorts of issues and subjects, ranging from geology
to trade unionism, before 'closing with a prayer' .[116 ] Other voluntary
societies also helped to promote a shared consensus on social and
political issues, particularly the debating and literary societies which
young artisans clustered around. James Leatham, a printer and, later,
socialist agitator and writer, recalled that in his youth the Aberdeen
Commercial Literary Society of which he was a member consisted of
a 'crowd of young lawyers, solicitors, medical students and skilled
workers' .[117 ]
Affording the membership fees of clubs and societies was a hallmark
of respectability, as was membership of a church. Indeed, religion
acted as a social cement bringing together and furthering under-
standings between the different social classes in Scotland. Scottish
Presbyterianism's virulent brand of anti-Catholicism was used to
define a sense of Scottish identity which excluded large sections of
society, particularly the Catholic Irish. In much the same way as race

102


-----

_Respectability and the Scottish Working Classes_

in the Southern states of America in the post-Reconstruction era
created alliances between poor whites and their social superiors, sec-
tarianism in Victorian Scotland performed a similar function, as
hostility to Irish Catholics cut across all social groups. Helen
Crawfurd, daughter of a small bakery owner in Glasgow, and, later,
a leading suffragette and member of the Independent Labour Party
(ILP), recalled in her autobiography that she looked 'upon the Fenian
and Catholic Irish as sub-human' .[118 ] David Kirkwood, speaking of his
childhood in Glasgow, referred to the social distance between Catholic
and Protestant, saying 'it would be untrue to say we were one people.
Religion and race ... kept us apart' .[119 ] The response of the Irish was
to withdraw into their own community which centred on the Church
and a reactionary priesthood. As William Walker points out: 'the
Catholic Church created an entire way of life based upon the parish
church, school and church hall' .[120 ]

Respectability was, thus, a culture of exclusion. It sought to repro-
duce the status hierarchies of the workplace in the wider society and
shore up gender divisions by increasing the dependency of women on
men. John Holley, in his study of working family economies in
Victorian Scotland, showed that the level of female dependency on
men increased in proportion to the skill of the worker. In the Borders
tweed mill of Ballantynes, Walkerburn, in 1881, 57 per cent of skilled
workers' families were dependent on the man's wage, compared to
only 31 per cent of unskilled workers' families. [121 ] Respectability
from whatever point of examination was, thus, ultimately divisive.
However, these relationships and hierarchies were influenced to a
large degree by the speed and scope of technological and organisa-
tional change taking place in the economy.

###### Chapter 10

##### SKILL AND MANAGERIAL
 AUTHORITY, 1850-1880

In periods of intense change, such as that associated with the first
half of the nineteenth century, the status of formerly respected occu-
pations, such as handloom weaving, and the literate culture and way
of life associated with them could be undermined and ultimately
destroyed. William Thorn, the poet weaver, was so impoverished that
he could not purchase a copy of the Aberdeen Journal in which his
first poem was published. [122 ] These insecurities did not disappear
after 1850, but in the third quarter of the nineteenth century tech-
nological changes did not appear as threatening. The expansion of
the economy brought with it not only more jobs and higher wages,
but also new products, which called on an even greater demand for
a variety of skills.
Cotton was perhaps the most affected by technological innovation
with the introduction of the self-acting spinning mule, which was
gradually appropriated by female spinners, and the universalisation
of power-loom weaving. Similarly, shipbuilding experienced profound
redistribution of skill and a heightened division of labour with the
change from wood to iron and, later, steel construction. As a result
the shipwright was marginalised, but the change in material created
a highly skilled class of metal workers, whose job it was to shape,
bend and join hot iron plates. However, the new subdivision of
labour mean that no trade was capable of controlling the work
process. As W. C. Steadman put it:

In the building of the hull of an iron ship, the work which in
earlier times, and in wooden ships, would have been done by one
man ... is now divided up amongst men in several branches,
such as platers, riveters, holders-up, putters-in, drillers. What

104

_Skill and Managerial Authority_

have originally been branches of one trade, have now become
distinct trades in themselves. [123 ]

The construction industry was also affected by significant changes in
the distribution of skills, with some trades being subject to deskilling.
According to Raymond Postgate, painting was by the 1860s open to
unskilled labour and master painters 'could and did put totally
unskilled labour, after perhaps a half-a-day's instruction, onto slopping
paint on their jobs' .[124 ] In plumbing a ruraVurban divide emerged
with the town plumber concerning himself with the erection and
repair of WCs, while in the country he specialised in installation and
maintenance of pipes. [125 ] Supplementing the specialisation of labour
was the shift to a rudimentary system of standardised parts. Much of
the preparatory work in the construction industry was being reduced
through prefabrication. Saw mills took over from the carpenter the
business of making doors, staircases, windows, and so on; [126 ] prefab-
rication did away with the need for plumbers to make their own
pipes.I27
In other trades changes were confined to the reorganisation of
production, which increased firm and product specialisation and
intensified the division of labour. In engineering local specialisms
began to emerge in the 1850s and 1860s. Bertrams in Edinburgh was
already a noted manufacturer of paper-making machinery by the early
1850s, and engineering firms in Leith specialised in marine engineer-
ing.128 In the Glasgow area locomotives, textile machines and marine
engineering were specialised product lines. As the president of the
Institute of Mechanical Engineers put it in 1874, 'within the last few
years ... the business of mechanical engineering has divided itself into
distinct branches so that the locomotive builder is little more than
locomotive builder' .[129 ] The decline of the multi-product engineering
workshop reduced the need for all round skills; indeed, it was rare
after 1850 for apprentices in large works to be trained in all aspects
of the engineer's craft and they became specialised as either fitters or
turners. [130 ]

In the coal industry the extensive use of blasting powder in the
1850s increased output and that in itself necessitated the introduc-
tion of labour saving haulage devices to speed up the transfer of coal
from the bottom of the pit to the top. Winding machines and endless
chains and ropes were introduced in addition to steam-powered
underground haulage engines which replaced the muscle power of
men and horses. As more coal could be transported to the surface the

traditional output restrictions of the collier, that is, the darg, were
interfered with. [131 ] Although they did much to improve productivity,
these innovations did not make any serious inroads into the skill of
the collier; indeed, the most important change in the position of the
coal-getter was the tightening of industrial discipline and the introduc-
tion of a new contract system in the 1850s which made all agreements
terminable on a day's notice. In 1866 no notice at all was needed,
which had a two-sided effect on relations between owners and col-
liers. The owners were empowered to regulate output more closely
with demand, but, at the same time, allowed the colliers to leave a
badly paid contract for a more lucrative one. [132 ] Complementing
contract changes was the increase in supervisory workers. By 1868
one in fifteen persons employed in the pits of Scotland was either a
manager, deputy manager, or overlooker. [133 ] Colliers were also forced
to instruct labour chosen by management, which effectively challenged
entry rules and the system of patrimony it was based on, and they
were in the 1850s forbidden to form trade unions or hold meetings
underground. [134 ]
The technical improvements, however, were not in the main labour
displacing. The element of 'craft mystery' was still in many trades a
tangible factor giving the worker a measure of control over the
planning and execution of his work, something which was enhanced
by the marked unwillingness of Scottish employers to alter the capitaV
labour ratio due to recurring problems in world markets. In these
circumstances deskilling was hardly a viable strategy in the pursuit
of increased productivity and lower costs, and realisation of this led
employers to experiment with a series of industrial strategies to
address the question of the wage/effort bargain and to enhance their
control over their workforce. This was achieved through direct
(enhanced control and supervision) and indirect (internal subcon-
tracting and incentive payments schemes) means.

Paternalism was, perhaps, the most sophisticated method of estab-
lishing direct social control over the workforce. It had a long historical
pedigree as a means of social control within the relatively closed
parameters of landed society, and was traditionally used as a way of
managing the tensions which arose from the existence of huge
inequalities in the distribution of power and wealth within this mode
of production. The operation of the system was based on both parties
in landed society recognising the reciprocal rights and duties involved
in the paternal relationship. In return for the acceptance of the
unquestioned right of the landowner to exercise authority and power

106


-----

in his sphere of ownership, the subordinate members of landed society
expected to have work for life and to be protected against exigent
problems, such as famine, and other pressures resulting from the
growing commercialisation of agriculture in the eighteenth century.
Recent historical research has applied this concept to the wider arena
of class relations in capitalist society, as well as industrial enterprises,
most notably Patrick Joyce's study of the Lancashire cotton towns. [135 ]
Joyce argues that the implementation of paternalism by employers
was fundamental to understanding the stabilisation of class relations
in the mid-Victorian period. As employers moved away from a policy
of confrontation and the intensive quest for accumulation, a civic ethos
emerged which stressed the virtues of philanthropy and of awarding
recognition to labour. Although this did not abolish conflict between
capital and labour, it modified it and made it more manageable. At
the micro level of individual enterprises, detailed studies by historians
have shown how paternalism encouraged worker identification with
the goals of management and assisted in the recruitment and reten-
tion of labour through establishing strong links with worker families
and firms. [136 ] Powerful and informative as these studies might be, one
can argue that Joyce, in particular, has placed too much weight on the
concept as a means of understanding the stabilisation mid-Victorian
liberal capitalism. Paternalism has several limitations and weaknesses
as a strategy for manufacturing consent in the workplace and the
wider industrial/urban culture and an awareness of these will help in
applying the concept in a more meaningful and insightful manner.
Firstly, as Newby eta/. have observed, paternalism in landed society
was based on tradition, which legitimised the right of the person
embodying it to control subordinate forms of labour. This enabled
power relations to become moral ones as the subordinate classes
accepted the dominant class's definition of their social situation. [137 ]
However, the moral authority of the landowner was not easily trans-
ferable to a capitalist society, where social relationships were
governed less by intimate personal bonds, and more by what Thomas
Carlyle called the 'cash nexus'. The authority of the capitalist was
established through the wages system and worker dependence, rather
than by custom and tradition. Job security and protection from exi-
gencies were seen as barriers to the free movement of capital and
labour, and in a price conscious society the antithesis of the laws of
supply and demand. Security of employment was, moreover, prob-
lematic in a society in which wealth was as much destroyed as it was
created through the continuous cycle of boom and bust.

###### 107

Secondly, the intimate nature of the class structure of landed soci-
ety was missing in industrial capitalism after its pioneering phase.
Social distance increased between the worker and the employer both
in the workplace and the community. The defection of the middle
class from the disease-ridden and overcrowded inner-city areas to the
cleaner and healthier suburbs reconstructed residential patterns on
explicitly class lines. [138 ] The workers became alienated from other
social classes and only came into contact with their superiors in the
course of their work; but even here this was becoming rarer as indus-
try grew in size and employers withdrew from the sphere of produc-
tion, devoting their energies towards the sphere of distribution. As
plant size increased the construction of a bureaucracy was unavoid-
able, and this development, as we will see, placed several tiers of
authority between the owner and the worker.
Thirdly, the impersonal nature of production in capitalist society
made expectations of deferential behaviour unrealistic among urban
proletarians, particularly skilled workers, of which independence
was one of the chief characteristics of their culture. As Joyce notes,
the desire for self-respect among workers meant that the deferential
aspect of the paternalistic relationship was missing in an industrial
environment. He also noted that the desire for self-respect was also
reciprocated by the employers, many of whom had risen from hum-
ble backgrounds. They disliked being called 'Sir', and were acutely
aware of the need to combine the aloof with the familiar. [139 ]

Such factors as these restricted the operation of paternalism to spe-
cific locations and production sites. Glasgow, for instance, with its
massive and continually shifting population, and its varied occupa-
tional structure, lacked the community stability needed to cement
paternalistic relations. Although some of the larger textile firms in
the city adopted a policy of company welfare, as did the Caledonian
Railway Company through its company sponsored Friendly Society,
the scope was limited and the rewards negligible. [140 ] Shipbuilding
firms owned considerable amounts of housing, but this was used
either to overcome problems associated with fluctuating labour sup-
plies, or to prevent supervisors from occupying the same tenements
as journeymen. [141 ] As Joe Melling argues, the provision of welfare in
these cases was based on a rational cost/benefit basis or with an
avertly strategic purpose behind it. [142 ] It was, therefore, in the small
towns and isolated industrial villages, where the employer(s) had a
near monopoly in the labour market, controlled housing, and
through acts of public benevolence was able to extend the workplace

authority beyond the walls of the factory, that paternalism was a
realistic and highly beneficial employer strategy.
Paternalism was used extensively in the thread mills of Paisley and
the coalfields of Midlothian where the working community was
more cohesive and stable and dependency on a specific employer was
evident. Hassan's study shows that in 1861, 94.9 per cent of all
Newtongrange miners had been born in the coalfield, with the Irish
only accounting for 1.3 per cent of the total population of the area.
Participation rates in the mining industry among the males in the five
villages studied varied from 70 to 100 per cent. [143 ] In Paisley a similar
pattern emerged. A study of heads of households having connection
with the textile industry showed that in 1851, 77 per cent were
natives of the burgh; while in Bridgeton, Glasgow, the figure was
only 36 per cent. [144 ]
The stable communities were treated to a range of welfare provi-
sion designed to increase worker dependency on the employer, all of
which, as we will see, helped stabilise industrial relations. The thread
barons of Paisley not only provided a comprehensive system of welfare
for their own employees, which included pensions, schooling and
housing, they also donated hospitals, churches, schools and other
civic amenities to the town. [145 ] Their antennae reached beyond the
factory gates to enmesh a whole community of workers in a social
matrix welded together by a mixture of material and ideological
supports which were both obvious and, at the same time, discrete
and subtle. Even those workers in Paisley not directly dependent on
the thread firms for employment and wages felt able to identify with
their commercial success and civic benevolence, as did the town's
smaller enterprises. The procession to mark the inauguration of the
George A. Clark Town Hall in 1882 symbolised the economic and
social power of the threadocracy. Every trade in Paisley was repre-
sented, from blacksmiths to joiners, from bricklayers to engineers, as
well as friendly societies, public authorities and officials. The banners
of the various trades included inscriptions such as 'Wher'er the Town
Hall chimes do ring, the Donors to our minds they bring' (thread-
workers); 'Long live the Brothers [Clark] one and all, the Donors of
the new town hall' (joiners); and 'Combine to support, but not to
injure' (bakers).146
The celebrations surrounding the inauguration of the Town Hall
were interpreted by the working class in terms of mutual dependency.
This was also true of other industries and small towns. In the Mid-
lothian coalfields, the owners donated libraries, schools, bowling

109


-----

greens and parks to the mining communities, and also provided assis-
tance for widows of colliers killed in mining accidents and benefits
for those men incapacitated through industrial injury. [147 ] Housing
was also provided at Dalkeith rent free and was found to be superior
to that generally prevailing in Scottish mining districts. Moreover,
housing was never seen as a weapon against militancy as it was in
Coatbridge for instance. Evictions were not unknown, but they were
said to have been 'rare'. [148 ]
These acts of benevolence had the effect of not only increasing
worker identification with the firm, but also, depending on the scale
of the civic philanthropy, of representing the industrial community in
the persona of the employer. An example of this was the monument
of the shipyard workers of Dumbarton to the memory of their
employer, William Denny, shipbuilder. Another might be found in the
workers of Coats, cotton thread manufacturers of Paisley, parading
the streets of Edinburgh on an away day excursion with their
company banners, or turning up in their 'hundreds ... late at night'
in 1857 to welcome James Coats and his American bride back from
their honeymoon. The Paisley Herald described the scenes:

The deafening shout of the multitude when the first carriage
came in sight, the music of the instrumental bands ... there was
also artillery to fire midnight salvoes, after which the carriage
horses were unyoked, [and] a great army of Ferguslie workers
pulled the first carriage up to Woodside House where his father
lived. [149 ]

Where paternalism was not an option other forms of direct control
were adopted. In industries where work was confined under one roof
as in factories and workshops, close supervision by foremen was
favoured as a way of imposing more discipline and pushing the
workforce to more effort. The foreman performed most of the tasks
of management; he was an organiser, responsible for hiring and fir-
ing, distributing overtime, training, and ensuring the smooth running
of the production process; and he was also a quality controller in the
absence of such a workplace specialist. Enjoying relative economic
security in times of depression, the foreman had a lifestyle which
marked him out in the working community. As an authority figure,
embodying the economic and social power of capital, his was the
subject of deference from other workers. His power is well-illustrated
in a letter to a building trade journal, which claimed that:

110


-----

_Skill and Managerial Authority_

In nine out of ten establishments, one man - the foreman - has
supreme control, and can employ or discharge whomsoever he
thinks fit .... By the present working system, a foreman who
has supreme control over 50 or 60 men can add to his salary by
receiving weekly pay from inferior hands, who are always ready
to tender the bribe in return for being kept in constant work. [15]o

Peter Taylor recalled that in finding work in Glasgow he had to wait
on the foreman of the works, who could 'only be seen at meal-hours,
or at six in the evening'. The fact that there were normally 'a dozen

[men] waiting on the same errand as yourself' [151 ] further demon-
strated the power the foreman had over the journeymen.
The system of foremanship was also used to enhance the subordi-
nation of women to men in the textile trades. In weaving, although
male tenters performed similar functions to those of foremen in other
trades, they were in charge of a mainly female workforce. As their
wages were dependent on the output of those under their direct con-
trol it was in their interest to drive the females to meet production
targets. By only allowing women and young girls to work the looms,
thus restricting the supply of labour and keeping out males, they
enforced a strict sexual division of labour. This only reinforced stereo-
type images of women as dependants and incapable of exercising
authority in the workplace. [152 ]
Internal subcontracting was the major means of imposing indirect
control over workers, particularly in those occupations, such as
coalmining or shipbuilding, where close supervision was practically
impossible given the dispersed nature of production. Under this system
of labour organisation a leading craftsman or group of workers
was offered a price for a job and if acceptable he or the 'gang', or
'company', would recruit labourers, discipline and pay them. The
system had advantages for both employers and men: it offered the
employers a ready-made substitute for inadequate managerial and cost
accounting resources; for the men it provided avenues of mobility for
key workers and through piece work, ensured individual and group
self-discipline. Among Monklands, ironstone miners subcontractors
were chosen by the employers on the basis of 'loyalty and experience'
and were left to recruit and organise team workers. [153 ] In the ironworks
themselves, puddlers paid their underhands, as did the shinglers their
assistants. [154 ] In coalmining and shipbuilding similar arrangements
existed between skilled workers and their assistants or labourers.
This created divisions between these different gradations of skill and

###### 111


-----

authority. Platers in shipbuilding were paid by the piece while their
assistants were paid time rates and this led to the former being paid
'at least three times as much as the helper' .[155 ]

The relationship was essentially exploitative as platers were in the
habit of taking days off and making up their losses by driving them-
selves and their helpers. This worked to the advantage of the plater
who was working by the piece, but the helper on time rates could not
make up for lost days. The arrangement meant that the helper had
to work harder for less. Robert Smillie, the miners' leader, recalled in
his autobiography, that when working as a young man in the 'plating
squad as a labourer, helpers had to turn up every day, but returned
home if the platers were not there' .[156 ] Complaints to management by
helpers over loss of earnings or short payment fell on deaf ears. As
one commentator put it: 'the shipbuilders will not move in favour of
the helpers, and the platers will not voluntarily relinquish their
unjust privileges' .157
While divisive, the system of internal subcontracting had one major
drawback for employers: its operation meant that key workers were
effectively setting the intensity of the work rhythm, delimiting the
areas of skill and, hence, reward. In some areas it was used in a
democratic manner as in the case of the Burntisland Co-operative
Coal Trimmers' Association. The Association elected its own foreman
and one man as leading hand in each of the five squads of twelve,
who in turn formed an executive committee to run its affairs. The
employers 'do not attempt to exercise any sort of control over the
association ... nor are any labour superintendents employed by the
company' .[158 ]
To offset the worker power inherent in internal subcontracting,
employers experimented with piece rate payments. This had the
advantage of encouraging self-discipline among workers, as the
harder they worked the more they earned, and also promoting ideas
of individuality as workers were all on different earnings. Moreover,
as a worker under the piece rate system was responsible for his/her
own earnings there was little need for third party intervention. The
effort/wage bargain was, thus, determined by an individual's industry
and skill, rather than the organised collective power of the workers.
Piece rate systems, therefore, had an ideological, as well as an eco-
nomic, dimension to them, but in spite of this they had two fatal
weaknesses: they encouraged constant conflict over their interpreta-
tion and they involved complicated calculations. As an old woollen
weaver put it, piece rate meant that: 'The question of pay was a

112


-----

_Skill and Managerial Authority_

constant source of wrangling and annoyance .... Few weeks wages
were paid without some degree of feeling being shown' .[159 ]
The outcome of these different methods of controlling labour was
that the locus of authority in a number of occupations was not
homogeneous. Authority was dispersed within the complexity of
occupational structures and this, as Joyce points out, created within
the worker 'an indistinct notion of the capitalist employer ... as a
class, let alone the major class enemy'. [160 ] The social and economic
antagonisms of the workplace could be spread over a range of
authority figures including the employer, foreman, piece master, sub-
contractor and ganger, rather than focussed on an individual. The
house on the hill was still there, but in the large urban workshops
and factories the boss had removed himself from the sphere of
production to concentrate on the problems associated with the mar-
keting of the product. By doing so he made himself an increasingly
anonymous figure. Therefore, not only were workplace relations
enmeshed in a complex web of group and personal loyalties and
antagonisms, the easing of the rate of technological advance, com-
bined with changes in work organisation and the division of labour,
meant that employers did not exercise total autonomy in the work-
place. These factors, and the values and attitudes they engendered in
workers, had an important impact on the development of trade
unionism in Scotland in this period.

##### TRADE UNIONISM IN SCOTLAND,
 1850-1880: A NEW MODEL?

As we have seen the defeat of the Glasgow cotton spinners in 1837
encouraged workers to seek a more acceptable and respectable form
of conduct and organisation. This was reflected to some extent in the
decline of the practice of holding union meetings in public houses.
These apparent shifts in attitude and behaviour on labour's part has
allowed the third quarter of the nineteenth century to be seen by
virtue of Sydney and Beatrice Webb's monumental history of trade
unionism as the period of 'new model' unionism. [161 ] The archetypal
examples of this form of trade unionism were the ASE and the
Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners (ASCJ). In contrast to
the aggressive trade unionism of the 1830s and 1840s, the new unions
were seen by the Webbs as models of passive, bourgeois-minded
behaviour, eschewing the strike weapon and seeking to conciliate
rather than confront employers. The change of outlook was accom-
panied by the centralisation of organisation, the creation of sound
financial structures and the payment of friendly society benefits
rather than strike pay.
The Webbs' construct of new model unionism has been effectively
rejected by leading English labour historians, who have demonstrated
that the mode of organisation and concentration on day-to-day
issues at the expense of wider socio-political concerns existed among
craft workers even during the Chartist era. [162 ]The Scottish experience
would also tend to contradict the views of the Webbs. Far from being
models of centralisation, Scottish unions were highly localised and
fiercely independent institutions. Although we have no reliable figures
for union membership in the mid-Victorian period, R. H. Campbell,
drawing on the work of the Webbs, estimates that of the 14 7 000
trade unionists in Scotland in 1892 two-thirds were organised in
exclusively Scottish unions. [163 ] Even the archetypal 'model' unions

114


-----

such as the ASE exercised little control over the activities of their
branches. In the case of the engineers' society it is hardly surprising
as it was not until 1892 that the executive was elected on a district
basis. Previous to this it was composed of representatives of the
Society's London members. Branches openly contradicted executive
rulings. Glasgow members enrolled piecemasters in the ASE,
although this was against union policy and thus deemed 'illegal' .[164 ]
Scottish trade unionism in the third quarter of the nineteenth century
was thus based on local associations exercising wide powers of aut-
onomy on questions of pay and conditions in sharp contrast to the
bureaucratic centralised model of organisation articulated by the
Webbs.
The bureaucratic approach of the Webbs to the question of labour
organisation also fails to recognise that it was the immediate work
group rather than the union branch which was the primary unit of
working-class self-defence in industry in this period. Richard Price
has calculated that around 50 per cent of restrictions imposed at the
workplace in the engineering industry emerged out of 'informal
workgroup decisions rather than from shop steward or union policies'.
In the building industry when employers spoke of 'conspiracies' they
were more often than not, claims Price, referring to workgroup
action rather than trade unionism. [165 ] Joe Melling notes that even in
the late nineteenth century full-time union officials were 'still trying
to impose a coherent hierarchy of responsibility on their motley
organisations' .[166 ] Indeed, in a Scottish context, informal trade union-
ism with its flexibility was perhaps a more appropriate model of
organisation than the highly bureaucratic and expensive official ver-
sion given the volatility of the economy and the ineffectiveness of
official unionism. Hamish Fraser claims that, of the 46 organisations
listed in the first national Trade Union Directory of 1860, 'most were
poor and ineffectual and frequently undermined by dishonest offi-
cials'.167 Of course, for low paid women workplace organisation was
perhaps the only viable model of trade unionism. [168 ] However, it was
a mode of organisation that was associated more with weakness than
with strength.
As the unions were largely unrepresentative of Scottish workers at
this time, individual bargaining was also a feature of the relationship
between capital and labour. With skill at a premium and piece rate
payment growing in popularity workers could bargain on the basis
of individual worth rather than by collective strength. Working
men's autobiographies point to the widespread nature of the system

115


-----

of individual bargaining. Peter Taylor described the mechanics of the
process:

After being ten months in the place, I thought I was worthy of
more wages, but knew it was no use asking, for the manager,
and he alone, had the power to grant a rise [and he did not like
me]. I resolved to leave and told some of the men so. [169 ]

Taylor's bargaining strategy was in some ways forced on him as trade
unionism in Scotland fluctuated in terms of influence and at times of
economic depression underwent periods of severe retreat. Indeed,
unionisation was so completely smashed in the Scottish coalfields in
the 1860s that the miners formed the quasi-mystical Free Collier
Movement [FCM]; and no person was admitted who did not 'believe
in a supreme being'Y[0 ] Until its decline in 1866, the FCM was firmly
established in Lanarkshire, but also in the more passive coalfields of
Midlothian, where it was said to have 1200 members in December
1864. [171 ] Basing itself on the rituals and ceremonials, as well as the
lodge organisation, of Freemasonry, the FCM alienated many Irish
Catholic workers. The practice of naming FCM lodges after Scottish
patriots, such as Bruce and Wallace, and singing 'Scots wha hae' at
gatherings and meetings furthered the distance between the Scots and
Irish miners. [172 ] It is little surprising that sectarian tensions were
heightened and that this constituted a barrier to effective unionisation
in the coalfields. Alan Campbell notes that sectarian incidents were
most frequent in the period 1850-75; a phenomenon which coincided
with the heaviest penetration of Irish immigrants into the Lanarkshire
coalfields. [173 ] In Airdrie Scots colliers went on strike 'until all the
Roman Catholics should be expelled'; an incident which was fairly
typical of the antagonisms between the two ethnic communities. [174 ]
However, it was mainly community-inspired violence and acts of
hooliganism which constituted the mean side of Scottish/Irish rela-
tions in the coalfields. [175 ]
Another problematic factor in maintaining stable trade unions in
Scottish coalmining was the prevalence of temporary overseas emi-
gration. As the steamship had cut journey times to around sixteen
days and reduced the cost of travel across the Atlantic to £6, younger
miners took advantage of the higher wages to be had in America.
Youngson Brown noted that between 1863 and 1872 some 59 000
miners and quarrymen left Scotland, mainly for the USA, returning
in times of prosperity or during the winter months. [176 ] The key to

116


-----

mobility was wage levels, as miners' leader, Alexander MacDonald,
said: 'whenever the wages come to 4s or 5s or 6s a day they will not
be found here but will be off' . [177 ] The correlation between union
membership and wage levels in this period was strongly marked, as
mining unions almost completely collapsed in the economic down-
swings of 1848, 1863 and 1879. [178 ]

Trade union organisation also proved fragile in other trades in the
1860s. After the failure of the nine hour strike on the Clyde in 1866
union membership collapsed and two years later the Boilermakers'
Society was reduced to 156 members in Scotland, concentrated in
nine branches, the largest being Glasgow No. 2 with 41 members,
and the smallest Paisley with only two members. The weakness of the
Boilermakers' Society meant that 90 per cent of shipyard workers on
the Clyde in the late 1860s were unorganised. [179 ] On the railways
fewer than one in twenty workers held a union card, and the
Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants (ASRS) set up in 1871-72
by a paternalistic shareholder was said to have had a 'precarious'
existence. [180 ] Even the so-called new model ASE could only claim 500
members in three branches in Glasgow in 1860. [181 ]
Unskilled workers understandably found the establishment of
viable institutions more difficult to sustain. Labourers' unions were
established among railway carters and dockers in Glasgow in the

1850s and affiliated to the Glasgow Trades Council (GTC) when it
was formed in 1858, but they were short-lived affairs. [182 ]In the 1860s
and 1870s attempts were made by the trades councils to assist
unskilled workers to form organisations and some temporary success
was achieved in Edinburgh in 1868 with the establishment of a
Labourers' Association. In Glasgow, in 1874, the Glasgow Causeway-
layers' Association affiliated to the GTC, and a year later the Marine
Stokers' Association joined. However, as Hamish Fraser points out,
few 'survived the [onset] of depression' in the late 1870s. [183 ] The
fragility of organisation, at times, saw workers experiment with
alternatives to permanent association. A study of the Scottish woollen
industry shows workers employing an ad hoc strategy of organisation.
Hawick dyers in 1889 formed a union to achieve a pay rise and once
achieved, dissolved it, as did the town's 'fast' loom female weavers in
a struggle over pay differentials two years earlier. [184 ]
Continuity of organisation, therefore, proved difficult for workers,
even those who were skilled, and this enhanced informal workgroup
organisation. The question which emerges from the dominance of
this mode of association is: did union weakness encourage a more

117


-----

conciliationist approach to industrial relations by workers and their
organisations in mid-Victorian Scotland?

On the face of it there does seem to be strong evidence to suggest
that craft and mining unions were actively conciliationist. Presidents
of the branches of the Boilermakers' Society informed new recruits
that: 'We are not united to set class against class but to teach one
another that men are all brothers. Our greatest desire being to cultivate
a close and lasting relationship between those with whom we have
to do with in undertaking our daily work' .[185 ] The collaborationist
nature of the statement was further underlined in a society song
which included the following lines:

Now 'tis true that Capital
All the risk must run
Like a ship exposed to all
Winds beneath the sun;
Feel's the first trade's ebb and flow,
Must keen competition know.
So 'tis just and meet
Labour must co-operate,
And help with all their might
Master to compete. [18]6

###### If further emphasis was needed the rule book of the Boilermakers'
Society allowed members who became small employers, publicans, or
members of the managerial staff to remain in the union as honorary
members. [187 ] This society's attitude to capital was shared by other
trades. Miners in the west of Scotland regarded strikes as a last resort
and the union rule book 'emphasised that strikes tended to fail and
that collaboration was to be preferred' .[188 ] Midlothian miners echoed
this view and urged miners to adopted the 'rules and regulations
enforced by the Duke of Buccleugh at Dalkeith Colliery'. The union
rule book of the United Association of Colliers included the aston-
ishing statement that: 'In former times it was usual to impute all our
evils to our employers but whatever truth ... in this, in most instances
we are fully persuaded that they are attributable to ourselves' .[189 ] As
a reflection of the conciliationist mood miners and other trades
consistently demanded a compulsory system of arbitration, which
also contained an unstated demand for recognition.
However, the degree of pacifism among union members at this
time was somewhat exaggerated by the leadership. The rule book

118


-----

was more a chimera than reality. Strikes took place in most trades,
although more frequently in mining than in any other. Drawing on
the work of Gordon Wilson on the west of Scotland coalfields, it
would appear that major conflicts erupted on average every four or
five years between 1850 and 1874. The longest strike took place in
1856 and involved twelve districts and 15 000 workers for fourteen
weeks. There were 24 small-scale disputes in the period 1855-74.
The cause of these strikes was almost always reductions in pay,
although a few concerned the weighing of output. [190 ] Similarly, in
shipbuilding prolonged strikes, outside of the 1866 nine hours' dis-
pute, occurred in the depression years of 1874, 1876, 1877 and
1878. In the construction industry, wage demands were the source of
major conflicts between 1850 and 1880, although the issue of the
labour supply also assumed an importance. [191 ] Thus conflict was still
written into the relationship between capital and labour, but the
relationship itself had undergone a transformation.
From issues connected with the control of the labour process,
unions increasingly concerned themselves with the price of labour
and, in the main, abandoned attempts to exercise regulation of the
supply of it. The United Joiners of Glasgow argued in 1860 that 'no
restriction be imposed, rather than deprive our proportion of the
rising generation of some handicraft' .[192 ] The ETC found that of
those trades represented in June 1873 only two of the twelve had any
policy of restriction. [193 ] Market principles were recognised as deter-
mining the level of wages rather than custom or morality. The sliding
scale in the mining industry was a good example of these changing
attitudes. Making the best of the effort/wage bargain also signalled
labour's recognition of the permanency of the industrial order.
Moreover, since much of the industrial conflict, whether conducted
by the organised or unorganised, was sectional or, at the very best,
occupationally-based, and involved only a minority of workers, class
interests were subordinated to the concerns of the locality and the
immediate workgroup. Indeed, the weakness of the unions during
much of this period drove some workers to seek individual solu-
tions to their economic problems. John Wilson, cotton spinner, was
so disillusioned with the struggle, which had cost the operatives
'hundreds of thousands of pounds', to maintain list prices for spin-
ning, that he resigned himself to a privatised solution. As he put it:
'the question now is, what amount of wages can I make to take
home to my family'. [194 ] Faced with sectional and sectarian divisions
within the working class, and confronted by a self-confident and

119

well-organised industrial bourgeoisie, the unions of this period were,
not surprisingly, weak and fragmented. Indeed, it is clear that many
workers, particularly women, saw them as irrelevant to their social
situation. The high subscriptions in a low waged economy also made
them seem exclusive even to the best paid workers, with those in the
skilled trades not always able to afford union dues. Membership of
the Boilermakers' Society was held back in this period by the fact
that shipyard workers earning 17-24s per week in the late 1860s
found it difficult to pay 4s a month in subscriptions, and this led to
mass disaffection. [19]5
Similarly, gains made in one period could be swept away by the
onset of depression or by an employer backlash. During the boom of
the early 1860s bakers in Glasgow and Greenock achieved a twelve
hour day heralding an end to 'the days of slavery'; however, in 1884
they were striking against an 80 hour week. [196 ] Engineers in the reces-
sion of 1878 not only experienced wage reductions, but also lost the
51 hour week. Joiners also experienced a similar pattern of success
followed by retreat. A strike in 1870 for a nine hour day was success-
ful after fourteen weeks of struggle, but a downturn in the fortunes
of the building trade just six years later saw these advances cancelled
out and wages substantially reduced. [197 ] Other trades experienced the
ebb and flow of fortune and with each setback membership declined
proportionately. Only well-organised and cash-rich unions such as
the Operative Masons could hope to maintain solidarity in times of
distress. By 1870 the masons had established a nine hour day in forty
towns in Scotland and there is little evidence to suggest that this gain
was eroded in the depression of the late 18 70s. [198 ] It must also be
remembered that gains were sometimes made at the expense of other,
less well-organised workers. This was true of the construction
industry, and applied with equal force in the case of the iron industry.
Here the highly skilled moulders won a 51 hour week in 1872, 'the
only craft', according to Tom Johnston, 'in the industry to secure the
concession'. [199 ] However, these sectional advances were only reflective
of the general weakness of trade unionism in Scotland during this
period.
But weakness was also a motivation for greater solidarity. The
growth of trades councils in the 1850s and 1860s drew workers from
different trades together to discuss matters of common interest,
including those of a political nature. Their activities in this respect
cast doubt on the claim by Alaister Reid that workers accepted 'the
separation of their economic concerns and their political representa-
tions'.200 The councils were at the forefront of agitation for the

franchise and for the amendment of anti-trade union legislation. The
ETC was a branch of the Scottish Reform League (SRL) and was
active in the municipal politics of Edinburgh. To this end it estab-
lished the Municipal Election Committee, which later became a
permanent body - the Scottish Reform Union. With the granting of
the franchise to urban householders in 1867, the ETC supported
nationalisation of the railways and a non-sectarian system of educa-
tion, among the more usual trade union demands.[201 ] Indeed, most
trades councils at this time in Scotland recognised that a political
solution was necessary to remove the legal impediments barring the
effective waging of the economic struggle. However, the political role
of the trades councils did not please some unions in the labour
movement, such as the cotton spinners, who severed ties with the
GTC for being 'too political'.[202 ] In spite of opposition of this kind, the
councils continued in their efforts to raise the political consciousness
of workers, alerting them to the need to combine in greater numbers
to combat organised capital. The Address of the GTC in April1873
'To the Trade Unionists of Scotland' called on the organised workers
to combat 'the arrogance of capital' by organising on a much broader
national front. As the Address put it:

The trade societies that simply protected local interests will be
found to be inadequate to meet the demands of the future. The
disposition of the employers to unite for the purpose of frus-
trating the just demands of labour, the concentration of capital,
coupled with the application of machinery ... a general organi-
sation of skilled labour becomes absolutely requisite. The primary
object of this institution is to levy a small sum on each trade,
according to its numerical strength, for the purpose of supple-
menting ... those who have already a protective fund, and gen-
erally assisting trades in the throes of a lock-out, or a strike that
could not be averted without loss or degradation, instead of at
present depending partly on if not wholly on eleemosynary aid.

Although this attempt to build a confederation of unions in Scotland
failed with the onset of depression the following year, the Address
presaged future developments, and, at the same time, explicitly
recognised the opposing and antagonistic interests of labour and
capital. However, this realisation failed in these decades to translate
itself into self-determined political action on the part of the workers.

 INTERPRETATIONS

Coming as it does between the turbulent years of Chartism and the
rise of socialism in Scotland, the period 1850-1880 has been viewed
by some historians as a period of class collaboration and political con›
sensus.1 The class antagonisms of the Chartist era, which threatened
to undermine the political system, gave way to a more harmonious
and stable set of social relationships between capital and labour based
on a shared commitment to the values and ethos of liberal capitalism.
In this scenario of historical development stabilisation was closely
identified with the emergence of an elite upper stratum of 10-15 per
cent of the working class - the labour aristocracy - whose earnings,
lifestyle, status and values isolated it from the rest of the working
class and pushed into the welcoming arms of the middle class. Under
bourgeois influence and patronage the labour aristocracy actively
sought incorporation into the major institutions of civil society and
the state, and accepted a framework of industrial relations founded
on conciliation rather than conflict. Accommodation rather than
confrontation characterised working-class political behaviour in this
period.
This reading of mid-Victorian social and political relationships has
experienced ferocious attacks from historians in recent years in that
it is inadequate and simplistic, and at least one of the original formu›
lators of the labour aristocracy thesis has rejected it. [2 ] Critics of the
thesis propounded by Hobsbawm, Gray and others have drawn atten›
tion to both its socio-economic and political weaknesses. Generally,
the idea of periodising history in such an artificial manner is attacked
since very little change is detected in the language or practice of
working-class politics in this period. Periodisation, it is argued, is the
outcome of a misreading of Chartism. Only by viewing Chartism as
a movement of the class consciousness industrial proletariat could

_Interpretations_

New Liberalism begat the Labour Party'. [8 ]

The debate over the labour aristocracy was important as it created
new understandings of working-class attitudes and behaviour over a
wide range of socio-economic and political subjects, from employment
patterns, to leisure pursuits and popular politics. But no matter how
telling the criticisms of the thesis were they did not in general provide
a satisfactory alternative explanation as to how stabilisation and
political consensus were achieved. [9 ] What we were left with was a
picture of a fragmented and sectional working class whose lifestyles
and behavioural patterns were so diverse across the country that to
talk of class seemed a fruitless exercise. The stress on continuity
further confirmed the impression of socio-economic and political
stasis. But the historical project to correct the wilder explanatory
excesses of the labour aristocracy tended to obscure significant qual-
itative and quantitative changes taking place both in the composition,
and in the workplace and political culture, of the working class.
In the middle decades of the century, formerly powerful alternatives
to industrial capitalism, such as the co-operative societies of the
Owenites, the trade guilds of the builders' union, the Chartist land
banks, and so on, lost their appeal to the dispossessed. The legitimacy
of private property and the permanency of the industrial system was
accepted by Scottish and English workers alike. The precepts of the
moral economy of the first half of the nineteenth century which had
conditioned the political economy of the labour movement gave
way to a recognition of labour as a commodity, whose worth was
determined by the market rather than by custom and tradition.
There were also changes in the social relations of the workplace
and in working-class cultural values. The middle classes mounted
an impressive assault on the behaviourial patterns associated with
the pre-industrial order, particularly drinking and riotious assembly.
Although there had been attempts earlier to remould working-class
culture, particularly its rougher aspects, the mid-Victorian period
witnessed an intensification of effort on the part of the middle classes.
In the workplace, a more paternalist and welfare-orientated regime
was introduced by employers to modify the bitter and hostile rela-
tions which had developed in the 1830s and 1840s. These shifts in
social relations were concomitant with improvements in the standard
of living as real wages increased and brought with them a more benign
attitude among workers towards free market capitalism. Politically,
important changes were discerned in the conduct and language of
political struggle within the working class. Although the violence of
Chartism is exaggerated in some accounts of the 1840s, [10 ] there is no

###### Chapter 13

 INTERPRETATIONS

The last few decades of the nineteenth century and the opening
decade of the twentieth have been seen as marking the inevitable and
predictable rise of the Labour Party, and concomitantly the decline
of the Liberal Party. The key factors in this process were the growth
of class consciousness, particularly among the unskilled, due to mass
strikes in the last decades of the nineteenth century; adverse legal
decisions which drove the unions into politics; changes in the franchise
which brought more workers into the electoral system; and, finally,
the activities of socialists and the ideology of Marxism. The way we
thought about the origin and rise of the Labour Party was dominated
by the writings of Eric Hobsbawm and Henry Pelling, and their
influence was evident even in the works of Tory historians such as
Robert Rhodes James. [1 ]
Since then labour and social historians under the influence of Harry
Braverman's seminal work - Labour and Monopoly Capitalism
(1976)- have sought also to include changes in the labour process
that blurred the distinctive characteristics between skilled and
unskilled workers by narrowing wage differentials and opening up
skilled work to greater encroachment from the latter. The threat of
technological displacement acted to radicalise the skilled workers in
the direction of independent labour representation and the politics of
class struggle, thus breaking their allegiance to the liberal/capitalist
framework of British society. As one of the foremost labour process
historians, Richard Price, put it recently:

In general terms socialism emerged as a response to the re-
structuring of the labour process. For both the skilled and semi-
skilled, socialism provided a vocabulary which enabled the
tensions, conflicts and promise of restructing to be understood
and interpreted .... Socialism attained a new-found significance
in the 1890s as restructuring began to impact on the skilled and

129


-----

semi-skilled; equally, by 1900, as the evidence mounted of a
growing complexity of the problems of industrial and political
power, the syndicalist spirit made its appearance. [2 ]

Price's views marked a shift in the explanatory balance concerning
the rise of Labour away from the sphere of politics to the sphere of
production. Thus, the exploitation of the working class at the point of
production becomes the fundamental basis of Price's understanding
of political change and the growth of class consciousness in this
period.
Workerist views such as these have not gone unchallenged.
Historians from both the left and right of the political spectrum have
argued that, in these accounts of political development, the weakness
of the Liberals in the face of the growing level of class consciousness
has been seriously overstated, and that the level of deskilling has
been much exaggerated. Building on P. F. Clarke's important study of
New Liberalism in Lancashire in the late nineteenth century, [3 ] newer
political histories have highlighted the continuing appeal of Liberalism
to the working class. Alistair Reid summed up the new revisionism
when he claimed that:

Right up to the outbreak of the First World War there were few
signs of any widespread popularity of socialist ideas, and recent
attempts to relate the emergence of an embryonic Labour Party
from the 1880s to a major change in political consciousness, as
a result either of the erosion of the position of the 'labour aris-
tocracy', or of an escalation in industrial conflict are seriously
misguided .... The organised and enfranchised working class ...
continued to vote Liberal even when on strike, and there is no
reason to assume that a mere increase in strike activity would ...
result in a change in political consciousness. [4 ]

In this revisionist scenario, instead of being asked to 'Account for the
rise of the Labour Party before 1914', historians ought to be asked
'Why popular Liberalism continued to exercise such a hold on the
political allegiance of workers both north and south of the border'.
When examining the political situation in the north the question is
of particular significance as Scotland had been solidly Liberal
throughout the nineteenth century. A report of the Labour Party in
Scotland to its conference in 1914 glumly stated that: 'Unfortunately
Scotland was so imbued with Liberal principles that it was a harder
fight there than in any other part of the country'. [5 ]

130


-----

_Interpretations_

The diametrically opposed views cited above lead once more into
the question of continuity and change, and whether, as Reid contends,
it is correct to periodise the mid-Victorian and Edwardian years into
decades of quiescence and radicalism. While the evidence for Scotland
tends to suggest that Liberalism was still the major beneficiary of
working-class political loyalty until the outbreak of war in August
1914, it would be a distortion of the period to suggest that there
existed some sort of political paralysis, and that the increasing tempo
of industrial conflict and changes in the labour process did not affect
the consciousness of the working class in Scotland and elsewhere.
However, why this did not translate itself into mass support for the
emerging Labour Party involves an analysis not simply of the language
of politics, but also of the economic and workplace restructuring
which occurred during the period, the impact that this had on indus-
trial relations and trade unionism, as well as the major changes
which were taking place in the social world outside the workplace
and at the level of the state. As Michael Savage's study of Preston
shows, one-dimensional accounts of political change based almost
entirely, as Price does, on workplace developments, or language pace
Reid, fail to understand the dynamics of political transformation,
which are as much rooted in community concerns as those emanating
from the site of production, or national political systems. [6 ] Thus, the
partial accounts of political change offered by both schools of history
are in need of revision in order that a more rounded analysis of the
dynamics of politics in the period 1880-1914 may emerge.

##### RELATIVE ECONOMIC DECLINE AND THE PROBLEM OF POVERTY,

#### 1880-1914

The structure of the modern Scottish economy had been predeter-
mined in the mid-Victorian decades. The period up to the First World
War simply entrenched and expanded that structure. The numbers
employed in coalmining increased from 46 900 in 1870 to 147 500 in
1913, with just over half the workforce concentrated in the coalmines
of the west of Scotland. Output grew almost threefold in these
decades from 14 900 000 tons to 42 400 000 tons.7 Shipbuilding,
however, was the jewel in the Scottish economy's crown, as from the
1870s to 1914 it constituted the 'chief growth point', accounting
for 756 976 launched tonnage in Britain in 1913; more than the
combined total output of the German and American shipbuilding
industries. [8 ] As Scotland's premier industry shipbuilding's growth ini-
tiated similar expansion in related industries. The steel industry in
Scotland in 1873 was only capable of producing 1119 tons of steel,
but due to the increasing preference for steel over iron by Scottish
shipbuilders, output reached 485 000 tons by 1890.[9 ] Complementing
the impressive growth of industry were the equally important new
developments in the service sector, particularly transport. By 1901 it
was estimated that one in seven adult males were employed in trans-
port activities on Clydeside. [10 ]

Economic growth was encouraged by the expansion of the export
market. This was, perhaps, inevitable since the Scottish population
was becoming increasingly static, with a loss of 41 per cent of natural
increase, or 218 274 persons, in the 1880s alone. Census returns show
that between 1861 and 1901 around half-a-million Scots emigrated
to other countries, including England, and this trend continued into
the twentieth century. [11 ] Thus, low levels of domestic demand and the

132


-----

_Economic Decline and the Problem of Poverty_

product mix of Scottish industry combined to focus production on
overseas, particularly imperial, markets. Some 38 per cent of the
total output of the Scottish coalfields in 1913 went abroad. [12 ] Export
dependency was also true of Scottish shipbuilding and certain
branches of engineering, particularly locomotive production. Overall,
between 1870 and 1900, Scottish capital exports amounted to
approximately 10 per cent of the net national product; a figure much
higher than that for England over this period. [13 ]
In spite of these impressive economic achievements weaknesses
had began to surface in the late nineteenth century which heralded
future disaster. The industrial economy's buoyancy was ever more
dependent on the condition of world trade, which made it increas-
ingly subject to cyclical fluctuations. Scottish industry stuttered in
the period of the 'Great Depression' and suffered serious depressions
in 1904-05 and 1908-09. Industrial performance was also beginning
to falter, in spite of appearances to the contrary. Most of the steel
producers were former malleable iron manufacturers, for as steel
grew iron production declined. Consequently, the iron industry never
again reached its peak of 1870 as falling supplies of indigenous iron
ore forced ironmasters to rely on imported ores which increased costs
and lowered competitiveness in a market increasingly dominated by
Wales and Cleveland. [14 ] Even the steel industry began to run into
difficulties. The smallness of steel mills north of the border, the
additional transport costs, and the relatively high price of coal, saw
Scottish producers compared to their English rivals disadvantaged
by 5-7 per cent in costs in the 1880s. After 1900 'the position dete-
riorated' further and the Scottish share of British steel output fell
from 20 per cent in 1900 to 18 per cent in 1913. [15 ] Textiles too were
declining rapidly in terms of output and employment, particularly in
Glasgow where the cotton spinning and weaving sectors collapsed in
the 1890s. It was only the jute industry of Dundee, the manufacture
of thread at Paisley and wool in the Borders which held out any
promise of sustained growth. [16 ] Shipbuilding experienced falling
profit margins and Denny's shipyard on the Clyde between 1909 and
1913 made a loss of 28 per cent on its contractsY Failing competi-
tiveness in the commercial sector saw Clyde shipyards turn more
frequently to the state to provide warship orders to maintain the
buoyancy of the industry; a trend which grew after 1918.
Early responses to these economic trends from Scottish employers
saw a greater move towards amalgamation. As a result, industry
began to be concentrated into fewer and fewer hands, thus reaping

133


-----

the benefits of economies of scale. Arthur Mcivor's study of west of
Scotland employers shows the degree to which heavy industry had
become the subject of high levels of interlocking directorships. In
textile printing and dyeing a monopoly had been established with
the formation of the United Turkey Red Dye Company and the Calico
Printers Association; and in thread manufacture the amalgamation
of the firms of Coats and Clarks of Paisley in 1896 created the fifth
largest company in the world. Similarly, Tennants of Glasgow was the
largest chemical works in Europe and the North British Locomotive
Company in Springburn, Glasgow, was the largest locomotive pro-
ducer in the world. Other major companies on Clydeside included
the multi-national Singer corporation, Weirs in Cathcart, and the
big shipyards of the Upper Clyde such as Browns, Fairfields and
Yarrows. [18 ] Increasingly capital was nationalising itself, although
most of the firms remained family-owned and there remained a
multitude of small businesses. However, generally speaking, eco-
nomic domination was becoming the preserve of a charmed circle of
large companies.
Although the closing decades of the nineteenth century and the
opening years of the twentieth brought mixed fortunes for the indus-
trial economy, it would appear that on the whole real wages were
improving and the differentials between Scottish and English workers
were narrowing. The first UK wages census in 1886 provides the
most reliable guide to comparison between English and Scottish
wages. The data generated by the census has led, however, to con-
flicting interpretations. For R. H. Campbell it proved without a
shadow of doubt that Scotland was a low wage economy, [19 ] although
E. H. Hunt was more optimistic, viewing wages in the central belt as
near the UK average. [20 ] In reality, both were right. In certain occupa-
tions, such as cotton, shipbuilding, construction and printing, Scots'
earnings, as Christopher Smout has shown, were significantly below
the national average; however, in engineering, carpet manufacture
and distilling there was little difference, while in coalmining and
linen there was a slight advantage over England. [21 ]
The next wage census was in 1906 and there was, with the excep-
tion of the cotton industry, little or no difference between English
and Scottish wages. Scotland had gone from being a low wage region
to a high wage one in twenty years. This implied a remarkable
increase in real wages way above the 80 per cent figure for the UK as
a whole in the second half of the nineteenth century. The magnitude
of the increase, however, has been treated with some sceptism by

134

_Economic Decline and the Problem_ _of Poverty_

certain historians. Christopher Smout suggests that other factors have
to be taken into account before drawing optimistic conclusions that
Scottish workers before the outbreak of war in 1914 were enjoying
hitherto unknown prosperity. These include the fact that there were
substantial numbers of unskilled workers, such as shipbuilding
labourers and girls in textiles, who were badly paid by any standard.
Moreover, employers in the supposedly high-waged shipbuilding
industry also deliberately inflated average earnings of riveters by 25
per cent in their evidence to the wage census.[22 ] Research into engi-
neering workers' pay on Clydeside bears this out with 75 per cent of
fitters only averaging 30s a week, or about the same as the middle
grades of semi-skilled machine men. [23 ] It should also be borne in
mind that the cost of living and rents were higher in Scotland than in
England. Richard Rodger points out that for an identical basket of
food in 1912 Dundonians paid 10.2 per cent and Glaswegians 5.7
per cent more than Mancunians. [24 ]
Again there is the question of regional and gender differences to take
into account. Wages tended to be higher in the industrial counties of
Scotland than in rural or semi-rural areas. Glasgow carpenters and
joiners averaged 36s 1.5d a week in the early 1890s compared to
only 27s 7.5d in Aberdeen for a 51 hour week. This also applied to
unskilled earnings, with building labourers in Aberdeen earning only
21s 3d a week compared to 25s 6d in Paisley. [25 ] Homeworkers,
mainly women, endured the worst conditions and pay. In Edinburgh,
needlewomen were thought to earn 4-5s a week in the early 1840s.
By 1906 little had changed with shirtmakers in Glasgow enduring a
gross income of 8s a week in exceptional cases, but more normally
_4-Ss;_ it was not said for nothing that homeworkers 'slaved in the
summer and starved in the winter'. [26 ]

Poverty was endemic throughout Scotland and large numbers of
workers and their children were caught in its web. John Paton
recalled in his autobiography, that at the turn of the century in the
poorer areas of Aberdeen the people lived largely on 'tick', that is,
credit. [27 ] In these areas new or even second hand clothes were a
luxury. Older women remembered that 'lots of clothes were made
out of flour bags', and one even remembered 'sewing flour bags
together to make bed sheets'. [28 ]       - omen and children suffered most
from poverty. A study undertaken in 1906 by the Royal Commission
on the Poor Laws found that in Scotland 83 per cent of paupers
claiming relief were women and children. [29 ]
Large and enduring pockets of poverty in Scotland had as one

might expect a determining influence on the type and level of housing
for renting. In spite of improving wages in some trades, renting was
the preferred option even for skilled workers. The boom and bust
cycle of much industrial employment in Scotland meant that the
regular payments which house purchase involved were beyond the
reach of the best paid workers. On the eve of the First World War,
half of Scotland's population still lived in one or two rooms. [30 ] In
Glasgow, the situation was even worse with 62 per cent of the popu-
lation crammed into this type of accommodation. [31 ] As a result the
infant mortality rate (IMR) was exceptionally high in Glasgow, par-
ticularly in the poorest areas. In 1898, the IMR in Glasgow Gorbals
was 200 per 1000 live births. [32 ] The high concentrations of population
in urban areas contributed to this situation. Sydney Checkland esti-
mated that by 1914 no fewer than 700 000 Glaswegians were living
in three square miles, 'thus creating the most heavily populated
central area of Europe'. [33 ]
Thus, the problem of 'starving in the midst of plenty' was still a
prominent feature of working-class life in Scotland and one which
not only conditioned the cultural experience of many workers, but
also had important impact on political developments in this period.

###### Chapter 15

##### DRINK, FOOTBALL AND SECTARIANISM: WORKING-CLASS CULTURE IN SCOTLAND, 1880-1914

Tenement living created solidarities among workers, regardless of
ethnic origin, religious persuasion or position in the occupational
hierarchy, which contributed to those formed in the workplace.
There were few areas of residence in urban Scotland which were
ethnically pure, although certain districts might be more associated
with one ethnic group than another. Daily contact with neighbours,
petitions and complaints to factors, evasion of ticketing enforcement,
and other contested areas of the housing market, all brought workers
together. Employers, as we have seen, recognised the potential soli-
darities of tenement living at an early stage and built housing to
separate foremen from ordinary workers. Indeed, they went as far as
to reproduce the status hierarchies of the workplace in the wider
society. Railway workers in Springburn, Glasgow, were housed by
their employer- the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway Company-
on Springburn Hill. The houses at the top of the hill were 'of a better
standard and were for the top drivers, engineers and supervisors,
while the lower blocks were for other drivers and lower grades'. [34 ]
The solidarities of tenement living were also cemented by changing
marriage patterns. R. Q. Gray noted that in Edinburgh, in the period

1880-1900, unskilled males were marrying females from higher social
strata, promoting a trend towards greater social homogeneity. [35 ]
Ewan Knox's work on the marriage patterns of the petite bourgeoisie
of Victorian Edinburgh showed that 'contact with the established
middle class in 1890 was negligible'. [36 ] However, in contrast, 'close
contact with the petite bourgeoisie and the skilled working class' was
growing as 'significant numbers of grooms who were small masters
found their brides from families in the labour aristocracy' Y The

137

experience of unemployment also brought skilled and unskilled
together, particularly in the depressions of 1904-05 and 1908-09.
Bob Stewart, joiner, recalled that during recessions in his trade, he
took up various dead-end jobs, such as labouring in a bridge building
works, selling lottery tickets, and so on. [38 ] His experience could prob-
ably be duplicated many thousands of times over. This suggests that
contact between the skilled and the unskilled was greater than might
be expected, and that social exclusiveness was fragmenting in the late
nineteenth century; something which may have been assisted by
changing patterns of consumption, in particular the growth of the
Co-operative movement after 1880. Membership for the whole of
Scotland nearly doubled between 1895 and 1914, increasing from
238 248 to 467 270. [39 ] However, in some regions the Co-operative
movement grew even more spectacularly. In Lanarkshire, for example,
membership grew more than five-fold from 8525 in 1886 to 43 270
in 1913.[40 ]

Developments in the provision of leisure services was another,
albeit less conscious, force making for greater social solidarity. The
rise of mass sporting pursuits, particularly football, made leisure 'less
closely linked to a pattern of stratification within the working
class'. [41 ] By the 1880s football had a massive following in the west of
Scotland. One in four of all Scottish males aged between 14 and 29
were members of a football club, prompting a contemporary writer
on the game to remark that 'the enthusiasm of the Scot for the
Association game is without parallel in any race for any particular
sport or pastime'. [42 ] The first Hampden Park international between
Scotland and England in 1878 was watched by 20 000 spectators;
in 1902, 102 000 attended. [43 ] Very few analyses exist of the social
composition of the football crowd, but the death toll in the Ibrox
Park disaster of 1902 provides some clues. Two-thirds of the dead
came from the ranks of skilled workers. [44 ] Horse racing was also
highly popular and off course betting was, as Paton notes, 'an obses-
sion of nearly everyone'; a view confirmed by the Lord Provost of
Glasgow, Samuel Chisholm, and the Chief Constable of Glasgow,
John Orr, in their evidence to the Select Committee of the House of
Lords on Betting in 1902. According to them, the 'locus' of betting
'is the streets and the classes are the industrial classes'; the 'riveters
and smiths' and the 'labourers and dockers'. [45 ]
Counteracting the unrespectable nature of these pursuits was edu-
cation. As we have noted, the Education Act of 1872 provided a
universal educational experience for working-class children in Scotland.

138


-----

_Working-Class Culture in Scotland_

Gradually escapist clauses in the legislation permitting children to
work half-time in industry, or gain exemption form schooling at an
earlier age than thirteen, were eradicated. By 1901 the school leaving
age had been raised to fourteen and the system of exemptions except
in necessitous cases was abolished. The stress on Empire and the
Union became even more intense in this period as the new school
boards elected to run the system were dominated by church and
business. In spite of the fact that working-class candidates were
successful later in the century, Labour, as late as 1918, still had only
120 school board members in Scotland. The first chairman of the
Glasgow School Board was Alexander Whitelaw, leading partner in
Bairds of Gartsherrie, and the iron company also dominated the
Coatbridge Board.[46 ] Reflecting these interests the Education Code in
1895 made drill compulsory and after the outbreak of the Boer War
the Scottish Education Department (SED) issued a circular on the
importance of physical exercise in schools, saying that exercises:

Indirectly, bring the individual into contact with the principles
which lie at the foundation of national defence, and they bring
home to him his duties and responsibilities as a citizen of the
Empire.[47 ]

As part of the stress on Empire Scottish children were denied a past.
As Robert Anderson remarks, Scottish history was generally depicted
in schools as a squalid and wretched tale with little evidence of
progress or development, or as the businessman chairman of the
Govan School Board put it: Scottish history and geography begat
'provincialism'. [48 ] As part of this process of imperial reeducation
Empire days and flagwaving became part of the socialising experience
of the working-class child. In Edinburgh in 1908 a gathering of 1500
schoolchildren witnessed each school being presented with a flag by
the Victoria League, and harangued by Lord Rosebery on imperial
unity and citizenship.49
However, while it was evident that these educational and leisure
developments generated a greater sense of homogeneity among the
working class, particularly the skilled stratum, and drew them, if
marriage patterns are to be used, closer to the petite bourgeoisie, the
possibilities for division were as great. A contemporary study of the
Glasgow skilled working class at the turn of the century pointed to
the continued existence of two competing cultures; one, respectable,
the other, turbulent and rough. The respectable worker, it was

139


-----

claimed, cared not for 'football or whisky', but for discussions of a
'political or theological' nature, and hobbies, such as model ship-
making. He was, indeed, 'the backbone of the working classes' .[50 ]
However, parallelling this world was the rougher masculine culture
based on drink and football, which 'works, together with over-
crowded tenement houses, to make family life rather an impossible
thing' .[51 ] The sexism of this culture was brought out by John Paton
when he says of Aberdeen bakers that when 'the gossip of the bake-
house was exhausted', there was one topic which 'seemed inex-
haustible- women and sex'. [52 ]
Among the respectable Protestant skilled working class religion
was still an essential part of their consciousness. Some 65 per cent of
Glasgow children between 5 and 15 were said to attend Protestant
Sunday Schools in 1890. Among adults oral-history testimony from
all over Britain shows that church attendance in Scotland at over 50
per cent between 1872 and 1906 was, with the exception of Wales,
the highest in the UK. [53 ] The high attendance rates were partly due to
the increasing stress placed by the Protestant churches in reaching the
working class, which was mentioned in the previous chapter. However,
the later nineteenth century also witnessed a new sensitivity by the
Church towards the social problems of the working class.
The mid-Victorian church had been fiercely anti-trade union and
had adopted whole-heartedly the doctrine of laissez-faire, which saw
poverty as the consequence of moral failure. In nine out of ten cases,
remarked the Church of Scotland's _Commission_ _on_ _Intemperance_
(1867), poverty was the result of the 'sins' of the poor. The reac-
tionary views of the Scottish churches alienated large sections of the
working class and such sentiments forty years later led to the foun-
dation of the Labour Church movement, with branches throughout
Scotland. The movement was set up 'in protest against the social fail-
ure and middle class bias and assumptions of the regular churches'. [54 ]
These protests also resonated in the formation of the Socialist
Sunday Schools in Glasgow in the 1890s, which later spread to other
parts of Scotland. 55
However, as middle-class assumptions regarding state intervention,
poverty and political democracy came under increasing attack in
the later nineteenth century a greater willingness to accommodate
working-class social grievances became evident. A sign of this was
the increasing influence among churchmen of social witness and
building the kingdom of God on earth. Practically, this led to social
inquiries into living conditions, such as the Glasgow Presbytery's

140

_Working-Class Culture in Scotland_

investigation of housing conditions in the 1890s, the setting up of the
Christian Social Union in the early 1900s, and recommendations for
material improvement. This shift in the theology of the church did
much to attract workers to it, but as we will see later, it also did
much to affect the ethos of the burgeoning labour movement in this
period.
Linked to religion were the numerous temperance organisations. As
we have observed, temperance was an essential element in the culture
of respectability and its various organisations had a large subscribing
working-class element. But it was also important in the late nineteenth
century in shaping the ethos and in providing social analysis for the
emerging movement for independent labour representation. This was
recognised by the president of the Scottish Trades Union Congress in
1897 when he claimed that in building a reformed society the 'Trade
Unions have no better confederate than that of temperance'. [56 ]
The division between the two strands of working-class culture was
less impressionistically seen in the housing market, where from the
1880s its distribution among workers was more visibly stratified.
According to the Royal Commission on Housing (1884-85), families
in Edinburgh occupying one room only were 'labourers and people
of the poorest class', while at the upper end of the artisanal stratum
there was reported a 'growing demand' for self-contained flats, built
on two storeys with outside stairs and separate street doors. [57 ]
Consumption of leisure also produced ethnic and local rivalries,
which were highly evident in football, and often led to clashes between
rival supporters. The Hampden Riot of 1909 was, according to Bert
Moorhouse, 'one of the most spectacular instances of violence around
a British football match - with arson, baton charges ... fourteen
hospitalised policemen, slashed fire hoses, stonings, fights, knives,

[and] damage of £15 12s 6d to street lamps'. [58 ] Although this was
more the case in Glasgow, where the sectarian rivalries between Celtic
and Rangers continue to exist, other cities had their own scaled-
down version of this religious melodrama. In Edinburgh, the rivalry
between Catholic Hibernian and Protestant Heart of Midlothian is
well documented. Lesser known is that in Dundee between Catholic
Dundee United and Protestant Dundee FC. Aberdeen escaped the
worst excesses of sectarian rivalry as the Irish population there was
minuscule and there was only one football club - Aberdeen FC.

As is apparent divisions within the working class based on con-
sumption were compounded by ethnicity and religion, and also less
visibly by gender; a situation reinforced by employment practices.

141


-----

The right of the foremen to hire and fire allowed religious affiliation
to be used to police the boundaries of skill. Among ironworkers in
Lanarkshire, the Protestants tended to dominate the skilled positions,
while the Catholics were more often than not employed as unskilled
labourers. [59 ] In the higher skilled trades the situation was little differ-
ent. In the engineering trades of Coatbridge the skilled occupations
were the preserve of the Scots and Irish Protestants. The local branch
of the ASE met in the Orange Hall and there was not one Catholic
member of the Society until 19 31. [60 ] This situation was replicated
throughout the west of Scotland. Harry McShane recalled, in his
autobiography, that it was rare for a Catholic to become apprenticed
to the engineering trade in Glasgow. [61 ] Similarly, John Foster and
Charles Woolfson have shown that some shipyards on the Clyde
operated a policy of ethnic discrimination and that core yard workers
tended to be Freemasons or members of the Orange Order. [62 ] In the
Springburn and Partick districts of Glasgow there existed the 'most
intensely Orange section' of the city's proletariat. [63 ] Indeed, religion
determined one's life chances to such an extent that there was little
mobility experienced by Irish Catholics in the nineteenth century
labour market in the west of Scotland. The pattern of employment
of the Glasgow Catholic Irish which marked the post-famine years
was maintained until before the First World War - that is, clockwork,
labouring, lower grades of tailoring, and casual work in the boot and
shoe trade. [64 ] The only exception to this form of discrimination in the
labour market was Dundee, where, in spite of high concentrations of
Irish Catholics, sectarian tensions were, on the whole, quite muted.
This was put down by W. A. Walker to three factors; firstly, the
absence of a dominant culture; secondly, the absence of an effective
Orange opposition; and, thirdly, the fact that the Irish Catholics in
Dundee tended to be mainly women. [65 ] Thus, it would appear that
sectarianism was at its most divisive in places with a high degree of
association with the Orange Order. The Order had been growing since
the emigration of Ulster Protestants in the 1870s and its membership
stood at 25 000 in Scotland in 1900, of which 8000 were in Glasgow
alone. [66 ] By 1913-14, over a quarter of the Order's 400 branches in
Britain were located in Glasgow. [67 ]
The high and continuing levels of discrimination and prejudice
against Irish Catholics saw them retreat into their own communities,
which were naturally centred on the Catholic Church. Indeed, the
social value of the Church to ordinary Catholics cannot be underes-
timated. Walker has itemised the range of social services provided by

142


-----

_Working-Class Culture in Scotland_

the Catholic Church in Dundee in 1915, although as Bernard Aspin-
wall's research shows they were also duplicated in the west of
Scotland. [68 ] The services included churches and schools, voluntary
societies, such as the Catholic Young Men's Society, a St Vincent's
Hostel for respectable working girls, a Catholic day nursery, a work-
ing mothers' restaurant, a school club for girls, a home for Catholic
Working Boys, and through the St Vincent de Paul society a scheme
for administering rent books, an insurance and probation service. As
Walker concluded, 'Irish Catholic parochial life became a way of life
in which religious, political, economic, educational and recreational
elements were so fused as to form a culture from which total with-
drawal was unlikely'. [69 ] These links were strengthened by the emer-
gence of professional football. The original Celtic supporters' clubs,
the Celtic brake clubs, required that members were also 'fully fledged
members of the League of the Cross' .7° Even the overtly political
aspects of Catholic culture were bound up with the social. The United
Irish League (UIL) was concerned not simply with Home Rule, but
also with the relief of hardship among Scottish Catholics and, as a
result, membership often overlapped with that of Catholic friendly
societies.7 [1 ] The political implications of creating an enclosed culture
will be considered later.
Like the Irish, women were also treated as second-class citizens.
Their work was by definition low paid and unskilled and this rein-
forced wider societal notions concerning the inferiority of women. In
Victorian and Edwardian society the pervasiveness of the ideology of
'separate spheres' meant that 'work was defined as something which
men did, and, indeed, the working class was generally defined as
working men' .7[2 ] Margaret Irwin, trade unionist and women's cam-
paigner, beautifully summed up the these masculine attitudes when
she recalled that the manager of a powerloom factory in Glasgow
told her that he had once introduced male labour into his weaving
department; however, the experiment was short-lived as the 'men
gave it up, being unable to stand the ridicule to which they were daily
exposed to for taking up "women's work'".7[3 ] The object of society
was to keep women out of the workplace and in the home and,
indeed, a measure of masculinity, as well as respectability, in this
period was a non-working wife.7[4 ] Female inactivity in the labour
market after marriage served to justify capital in its failings to equip
women with skills. Work was seen as an interlude between school and
marriage. It also, as we will see, justified trade unions in ignoring
women workers' concerns, or in actively discriminating against

143

them. As one trade unionist in Dunfermline put it in the early 1890s:
'the women are ... quite content with their conditions of work, which
the bulk of them consider as terminable probation between them and
marriage'.7[5 ] Unfortunately many women and, as James Treble points
out, almost all working men, acquiesced in these assumptions
regarding the economic and social role of women. [76 ]
However, the economic and social realities of working-class life in
Scotland in this period conflicted with the domestic ideal of a patri-
archal society. Women did much paid work which went unrecorded
in the occupational census, particularly washing, child-minding, home-
work in sweated trades, and so on. [77 ] Moreover, given the number of
spinsters and single parents, many women had to work out of
necessity. Treble's figures for Glasgow in the period 1891-1911
show that around one-third of the female population of Glasgow
above the age of ten years were recorded as active in the labour
market. [78 ] Furthermore, in places such as Dundee women were the
dominant wage-earning section of the working class and their social
behaviour had all the hallmarks of a rougher masculine culture; a
matter, as one might guess, of grave concern to the Dundee middle
classes. [79 ]
Thus working-class culture reflected the dualism between the
respectable and unrespectable which had run through it from 1850
onwards. However, the move towards a greater cohesion of social
experience was also evident and that was partly the outcome of
important changes which were occurring in the late nineteenth-
century labour process.

 SKILL UNDER PRESSURE:
##### CHANGES IN THE WORKPLACE,

#### 1880-1914

The cumulative changes in the workplace in the period 1880 to 1914
have led Michael Mann among others to talk of the dawning of a
'second industrial revolution'. [80 ] In Scotland, these changes were trig-
gered by rising labour costs, falling productivity, high interest rates,
the increase in foreign competition and the decline in overseas
demand. This placed pressure on employers to rationalise production
and intensify the exploitation of labour. [81 ] Economic expansion was,
therefore, linked to improvements in technology and labour manage-
ment, and the magnitude and profoundness these changes inspired
created a fundamental rift in the social relations and structure of
Scottish industry, which had important knock-on effects for the
growth of trade unions and the tempo of industrial relations.
The chief characteristics of this 'second industrial revolution'
were: firstly, the introduction of new semi-automatic machinery in
coalmining, shipbuilding and engineering; secondly, the increasing
use of unskilled and semi-skilled labour in trades hitherto the preserve
of skilled workers; thirdly, the adoption of a rudimentary system of
standardised and interchangeable parts; fourthly, the predominance
of factory over the workshop as the primary unit of production;
and lastly, the introduction of aspects of Taylorism, particularly, the
premium bonus system (PBS), and new specialist categories of labour
concerned with the design and planning and supervision of produc-
tion. These changes also impacted themselves on the social relation-
ships of production and on the various methods of manufacturing
consent in the workplace for the imperatives of capital. But it is
important to note that it was not simply heavy industry that was
affected by changes in this period; smaller scale trades such as granite

polishing, trawling, and so on, were equally affected, although perhaps
not as profoundly as, say, coalmining.
In engineering, the introduction of the capstan or turret lathe and
the specialised boring and grinding machines reduced most of the
work of skilled workers to that of preparation. Turners found that
the new lathe reduced their work to fixing the precise rotation of the
cutting edges; thereafter, the machine was operated by semi-skilled
handymen. Ancillary tasks such as 'marking out', the determination
of 'speeds and feeds', and the grinding of cutting tools, were also
taken from the turner and parcelled out to a range of specialised
workmen. [82 ] The ASE claimed that as a result of these new machine
tools there were only 'seven' out of 46 federated districts employing
the turret lathe which were not 'manned by handymen'. [83 ] One
contemporary went so far as to claim that:

When set up by a mechanic a capstan or turret lathe 'can be
operated by a boy or girl', and that as 'an inexperienced boy of
fifteen', he produced 'more bolts in a day than two turners could
make in a week'. [84 ]

Even the fitters, whose work of rectifying inaccurate workmanship
was less affected by the new machinery, found themselves under
pressure. The systematic growth of interchangeable parts made for
greater tolerances, hence, there was a reduced need for precise and
lasting fits. Semi-skilled assemblers and erectors usurped the assembly
work previously the remit of the fitters, and, as a result, there was a
multiplication in the number of fitters' assistants and boys in the
engineering trade. [85 ] As Harry McShane, referring to his time in
Weirs' engineering works in Glasgow, put it: 'every morning each man
knew the job he was going to do during the day. The jobs were so
ridiculously simple that anyone could do them'. [86 ] In these circum-
stances apprenticeship degenerated into a form of cheap labour as
the number of apprentices rose and the content of training declined. [87 ]
The lack of job satisfaction led to not 'more than 50 to 55 per cent

[of Glasgow apprentices] completing their time and obtaining first or
second class lines'. [8]8
While the restructuring of the engineering trade allowed employers
the luxury of dreaming of the transition from workshop to assembly
line production, shipbuilding offered less scope for innovative methods
of rationalisation. Trade fluctuations made employers reluctant to
invest in new and expensive machinery and tools and this led to a

146

_Changes in the Workplace_

continued emphasis on labour-intensive production methods. However,
in the larger yards, the increasing size of ocean-going liners made the
construction of the hull by handwork extremely difficult and expen-
sive. These problems were in large measure overcome by the intro-
duction of pneumatic rivet machines and electrically-powered drills.
The impact of the machines was felt most keenly by the least skilled
handworkers- the riveters and the caulkers. There was, as Keith
McLelland and Alastair Reid point out, 'no reason why [the] opera-
tor should have been a skilled worker'. [89 ]The new machinery allowed
employers to make greater use of apprentice labour in caulking and
riveting. [90 ] Noting this change, a Glasgow factory inspector remarked
that 'Jobs formerly done by journeymen can now with [pneumatic]
tools be undertaken by apprentices'. [91 ] This view was underscored
by John Hill, leader of the Boilermakers' Union, in a speech to the
unemployed of Glasgow in 1908, when he said that:

Only a few years ago unemployment had no terrors for well-
organized skilled trades .... Now the tables are turned. With
improved machinery our craft is at a discount, and a boy from
school now tends a machine which does the work of three
men .... It is mostly machine-minders who are wanted. [92 ]

The change from iron to steel shipbuilding also led to 'a significant
decrease in the level of skill of both platers and their helpers' as the
manipulation of cold steel plates proved easier than dealing with the
heated iron plates. [93 ]
Similar encroachments into skilled work were experienced in other
trades. Coalmining was increasingly subject to mechanisation, with
22 per cent of coal in Scotland by 1913 cut by machine; a figure
higher than that in any other mining district in Britain.[94 ] In addition,
there was the installation of conveying machinery and the abolition in
many areas of the 'pillar and stoop' method of coal-getting in favour
of the longwall method, which allowed for increased supervision of
the work group and led to the erosion of the independence of the
traditional bred collier. [95 ]John McArthur, Fife miners' leader, summed
up the nature of the older collier's skills and the manner in which the
new mining methods had led to the degeneration of them, when he
said:

Old miners like my father were carefully trained men that per-
formed the complete operation of a miner. They undercut the

147


-----

coal. ... Then they would use a hand-boring machine, bore
holes, make up their own explosives and blow the coal down,
then form a roadway, help fill off the coal, secure the roof. Every
part of the process of mining was performed by the picksman
who was a face man. For a face man my father used a variety
of tools. He used light ... picks .... He had heavier picks for
cutting the coal and breaking it up, heavier picks still to deal
with stone work. For coal that was easy to bore he had a fast
borer, for difficult or hard coal he had a slow borer. He also had
a cleaner for cleaning borings out of a hole, a stemmer for
stemming the short hole, a heavy hammer or mash, a mash-axe,
wedges, splinters, and so on. He had almost a batchful of
tools. In contrast, all that a stripper - a miner working on a
machine-cut face - needed was a shovel, a pick with a mash
end, and a mash. Unlike the picksman ... the strippers were
careless about the condition they left the coal face since it was
not their sole responsibility. [96 ]

The lesser populated trades also experienced a large degree of
deskilling. The woodworking trades of the construction industry
witnessed the extension of the use of prefabricated fitments and the
increased use of ferro-concrete in the building of floors and beams;
developments which threatened to abolish the 'rougher carcase work'
of the carpenters. [97 ] The mass production of manufactured earthen-
ware sanitary products decreased the skills demanded of plumbers by
removing the need for lead fittings and making 'easier and very much
simpler the task of putting the work together'. [98 ] In stonework, the
practice of dressing stone at the quarry, the arrival of the pneumatic
chisel and other cutting devices undermined the work of the mason
by no small degree. [99 ] Coopers also found themselves 'not so skilled'
as the 'Division of labour has come in' .[100 ] Similarly, the invention of
the linotype composing machine in the newspaper trade removed
from the compositor the skill of producing justified lines of type
and replaced it with the less demanding skill of keyboard operation.
Monotype had the same affect in the book trade. [101 ]

Outside of the centres of industry and population the cold draught
of technological change was also being felt. The white fishing industry
of Aberdeen underwent a transition in social relations with the
introduction of the steam trawler. Prior to this the boats and tackle
belonged to the fishermen, but steam technology put the cost of
ownership beyond the reach of the small enterprise. The larger

148


-----

_Changes in the Workplace_

trawlers needed to encroach into the rich fishing grounds of the
northerly waters added to the time at sea and the cost of fuel, which
further reinforced the trend towards capitalist ownership of the
industry. Fishing, therefore, became a huge commercial operation
requiring a high level of finance which had the effect of proletarian-
ising large numbers of previously independent fishermen. [102 ]
The reorganisation of production and the encroachments by
machinery into the realm of skilled handwork can be seen as part of
a general process of intensifying the exploitation of labour by capital.
This was facilitated by the introduction of electrical lighting which
made shift work more common and, as a result, excessive overtime
working became a problem for trade unions in this period. According
to Thomas Ballantyne, assistant secretary of the ASRS, workers in
the employ of the Glasgow and South Western Railway worked on
average in the winter months of 1890 four hours and forty-eight
minutes in excess of the normal ten hour day. [103 ] It was a common
saying among railway workers that 'in the winter months a guard
never gets the chance of speaking to his children' .[104 ]

Tighter work discipline also followed. On the railways a new
system of control was introduced in 1900 which related the movement
of rolling stock to the availability and need for labour. To operate the
new system a 'strictly enforced hierarchy of obedience and account-
ability' on the part of the workforce was necessary. [105 ] In engineering,
the lock-out of 1897 won for management the right not only to
control the labour process, but also to 'introduce new systems of
supervision' . [106 ] However, it was the extension of the new incentive
payments systems which was the most effective in raising the work
effort and intensifying industrial discipline. By 1914, 46 per cent of
fitters and 3 7 per cent of turners in the British engineering trade
were on piece-rate payment, compared to only 5 per cent of all engi-
neering and boilermaking workers in 18 8 6. [107 ] Added to this was
the introduction of PBS, which involved the measuring and recording
of job times by stopwatch. W. F. Watson, in his autobiography, high-
lights the degrading aspects of such a system for time-served men,
when he recalled that:

The plant started up before time, and one had to get down to
the job immediately the hooter ceased; feed and speed bosses
were employed to see that this was done. Fixed to each machine
was a chart indicating the speeds to be employed, and the feed
and speed men, armed with feedmeters, perambulated the shop

149


-----

to ensure both men and machine were working to their utmost
capacity. We were not allowed to grind our own tools, all emery
wheels were removed from the shop. When starting a man was
given six standardized tools, ground to theoretic angles on
special machines, which were changed for new ones when worn.
Notices were posted forbidding any man to leave his machine or
vice - labourers were to be sent to the stores for tools and tackle.
We were not supposed to leave the job under any pretext ...
except when nature demanded - even then the toilets were
without doors for easy inspection. [108 ]

Although only 10 per cent of all engineering workers in Britain were
thought to be working under the PBS in 1909,[109 ] the threat of its
extension put a question mark over the survival of the independence
of the time-served man. As Watson's observation makes clear, under
PBS many workers experienced a loss of control over their methods
of work.
Tighter work discipline and more intensive effort combined with
greater specialisation of skill led to changes in the habits and customs
of the workplace. The ceremonials and rituals which were an integral
part of workplace culture and the social supports of artisanal solidar-
ity disappeared in the larger works towards the end of the nineteenth
century. The journeymen tied to piecework and responsible for more
expensive and sophisticated machinery had less time to indulge in the
elaborate initiation ceremonies with their equally lavish amounts of
drink. Moreover, such was the degree of specialisation of skill there
was arguably less of an achievement to celebrate. Alfred Williams, in
his study of life in a railway factory, illuminatingly describes how these
changes induced a very different, and more regimented workshop
atmosphere, from the one he had experienced twenty years previously:

Many pranks are played upon one another by the workmen,
though it is significant of the times that sky-larking and horse-
play are not nearly as common and frequent as they used to be;
there is not now the time and opportunity to indulge in practical
jokes. Under the new discipline the men are generally more
sober and silent, though they are none the happier nevertheless.
The increased work efforts they are bound to make at work and
the higher speed of the machinery has caused them to become
gloomy and unnatural, and, very often, peevish and irritable. [110 ]

_Changes in the Workplace_

Even in the smaller workshops the old forms of apprentice socialisa-
tion were being stripped of their intrinsic value. The washing of the
mason's apron, an important event in the _rites de passage_ of the
apprentice, was abandoned and the 'more modern masons were
satisfied by taking the youth to a public house and making him drink
a pint of beer' .[111 ] True the ritual smearing of the genitals with grease,
oil or ink depending on the trade continued. John Paton talks of one
of his fellow apprentices in a newspaper composing room being
seized, 'despite his struggles, and his clothing torn open while his
genitals were liberally smeared with printer's ink' .[112 ] These actions,
however, were more the product of a dosed male environment than
the surviving remnants of a once powerful artisan culture of rituals,
signs and ceremonials. As such they had their parallels in public
schools, sea -going vessels and other exclusively male institutions. [113 ]
The agent of socialisation was more and more the trade union, and
the unions responded by opening youth sections to ensure the trans-
mission of trade practices and traditions to apprentices. [114 ]
The changing state of social relations in the workplace also
impacted itself on managerial agencies for maintaining control of the
workforce. As we have stated in the previous chapter, employers
experimented with direct and indirect forms of control, which had
both advantages and disadvantages for the former and the workers.
The rationalisation of production methods and the introduction of
new technologies increased the desire of the employers to assume total
control of the labour process. As a result internal sub-contracting
began to disappear gradually in shipbuilding and other trades, [115 ]
which had the effect of lifting the wage/effort ratio out of the realm
'of personal disputes between a driving contractor and his men, into
a more generalised struggle between employers and workers'. [116 ] The
direct control of the foreman was also being reduced in the larger
engineering works with the introduction of PBS and other forms of
payment. The complexity involved in the constant calculation and
re-calculation of piece rates led to the creation of wages departments
and workers began to receive payment through the office rather than
the local pub. Time measurement of jobs also meant that the all-round
authority and competence of the foreman was eroded as increasingly
planning became separated from the execution of work. In the new
regime, planning became more a part of the strategic concerns of
work management, rather than something which was left to the
'tactical discretion of individual foremen' .[117 ] Recruitment of labour
was another function of the foreman which was disappearing as the

151


-----

larger employers established personnel departments. [118 ] The gradual
weakening of personal ties to individual foremen and squad leaders as
the size of the private bureaucracy grew acted to simplify the hierarchy
of authority in the workplace. More and more workers were being
confronted directly by capital or, at least, its managerial functionaries,
rather than by a host of authority figures as was the case in the mid-
Victorian decades. However, shipbuilding, with its dispersed work
sites, found dispensing with the all-round supervisory functions of
the foremen less easy than other trades. [119 ]
The harder edge to workplace relations also manifested itself in the
decline of employer paternalism. Hassan has argued that under the
weight of rising labour costs and erratic price fluctuations aristocratic
families, such as the Buccleughs and Lothians, found themselves
unable to cope and their inability brought a shift in ownership in the
Mid-Lothian coal industry to more entrepreneurial-minded employers.
By 1890 the Lothian Coal Company had taken over the Mid-Lothian
coalfields and its dominance ended the system of paternalist man-
agement built up over the nineteenth century by the landowners. [120 ]
Similarly, on the railways by 1912 the 'system of [paternalism] had
been gutted of any meaningful reciprocity', and petitioning of
employers for wage increases or other improvements in working
conditions was being rejected by the rank-and-file as 'degrading'; as
a result solidarity shifted to the union. [121 ]
Although few Glasgow industrialists favoured paternalism over
other forms of workplace control, the family-based structure of
ownership very often led to close relations between master and men.
Issac Beardmore, steelworks owner, thought nothing of drinking with
his workers in public houses. [122 ] But, as Tom Bell, engineer, recalled
in his autobiography:

With the expansion of imperialism, its shipbuilding, its arma-
ments, etc., Beardmore's grew like a mushroom. By the war of
1914, the old puddling process had died out. Electric furnaces,
cranes, automatic conveyors and up-to-date methods had wiped
out the old patriarchal conditions. [123 ]

As the chairman of John Brown's remarked to a government com-
mittee on shipping and shipbuilding in 1916, the construction of
company housing 'was not all philanthropy, but hard headed business
to separate the foremen from the men' .[124 ] Paternalistic initiatives

152

_Changes in the Workplace_

had, under the impact of changes in the nature of production, been
reduced to cost benefit analysis, thus stripping it of any notion of
reciprocity.
In the thread manufacturing industry of Paisley paternalism also
began to show signs of wear and tear as changes in the labour
process and the geography of recruitment began to spawn a more
oppositional mill culture. The stable organic industrial community of
the mid-Victorian period fragmented as the need to recruit more
female labour led to an influx of outsiders. Matthew Blair, in _The_
_Paisley Thread Industry_ (1907), highlighted the role of immigrants
not only in boosting the native population, but also the way in which
'The incomers brought many new ideas and practices, which have
materially changed the homely style of life that previously existed'. [125 ]
Their experience of a different process of socialisation made the
incomers amenable to alternative definitions of their social position
beyond that provided by the employer. Moreover, the demand for
labour also witnessed an influx of day workers from the more cos-
mopolitan culture of Glasgow. Coming mainly from skilled working-
class households, these female workers saw labour organisation as
both legitimate and natural expressions of working-class interests. The
end of the half-time education system in the early 1900s furthered
this process and denied Coats a hand in the socialisation of its future
workforce. Thus, the employers' view of the personal relationship they
had with their workforce was becoming increasingly anachronistic, a
point reinforced by the intensification of industrial strife in the Paisley
mills after 1897, and in the move towards setting up a trade union
for female workers. [12]6
Although the picture so far is one of increasingly real subordination
of labour to capital, as Bryn Jones points out, 'management cannot
construct, de novo, the conditions under which labour is to function',
as there is always a bargained context, which is fluid and dependent
on the balance of power in the workplace. [127 ] Additionally, the ability
of management to control the labour process is constrained by the
particularisms of the product and the market. As Pollard and
Robertson, as well as Reid, have shown for shipbuilding, [128 ] and Harley
for engineering, [129 ] the product market for British goods was highly
differentiated. This made it difficult for employers to implement
techniques of mass production: ships, machines, railway engines,
boilers, and so on, all had to be constructed according to the needs of
the purchaser. In the consumer-orientated trades, such as the build-
ing industry and jobbing printing, the one-off nature of much of the

###### 153


-----

work also imposed limitations on the use of labour-saving technology
and, as a result, workers retained a measure of craft control.
The subordination of labour to capital was, thus, never complete
during this phase of rapid technological and organisational change in
industry. The incompleteness of subordination and the continued
control exercised by workers over some aspects of their working lives
has, however, led to a tendency among social historians to dismiss
the impact of these changes on workers', particularly the skilled, con-
sciousness, as well as to play down the level of conflict emanating
from them. As Patrick Joyce puts it:

Employers were motivated neither by a desire to deskill or sub-
ordinate the worker, nor to introduce the most advanced
technologies ... the nature of labour and product markets, the
operation of inter-capitalist competition, and the resulting
reliance on workers, together always with the very important
matter of the cultural representations capital and labour had
of themselves and each other, often led to the adoption of a
_modus vivendi_ between the two sides, to areas of compromise
and co-operation in which capital often ceded to labour the
'control' [Richard] Price so persistently sees as grounds for
conflict. [130 ]

Although industry cannot be depicted as a system of social relations
based on permanent internecine struggle, and compromise as much
as conflict was written into the relationship between capital and
labour, the period of the late 1880s to 1914 stands out because of
the scale and velocity of change, which 'moved the question of
intensified work to a general level of experience' .[131 ] The threats
implicit in the restructuring of workplace technology and social
relations to the status of the skilled worker were acute since any
downgrading not only affected income, but also his standing in the
community. As Alain Touraine, et al., have argued:

Protection of occupational autonomy is a defence both of an
occupation culture and of the communal way of experiencing
work. Workers ... [oppose] output norms not only to avoid
excessive speeds of work, but also because pace destroys the
pride of craftsmanship in a 'good job' .[132 ]

The trend towards specialisation was lamented by craftsmen writers,

154


-----

_Changes in the Workplace_

such as Williams and Watson, because it struck at their notions of craft
pride, and held out the unenviable prospect of the end of a traditional
artisanal culture. It made resistance to the imperatives of capital
inevitable; a phenomenon which acts as perhaps the most important
barrier to employer control of the labour process. It also did much to
increase membership of trade unions.

###### Chapter 17

##### TRADE UNIONISM ON THE MARCH,
#### 1880-1914

As has already been noted, resistance to the imperatives of capital
accumulation and managerial strategies designed to increase the flow
of profit could be expressed informally, through the workgroup,
and/or formally, through membership of a trade union. Indeed, the
workgroup in the years up to 1900 continued to be an important, if
###### ad hoc, form of resistance. The main reason for this was the weak-
ness of trade unionism in Scotland. There were only 14 7 000 trade
unionists in Scotland, according to the Webbs, in 1892; a figure which
only amounted to 3. 7 per cent of total population, [133 ] compared to
4.9 per cent of the population for England and Wales. Regional
studies of union density have shown that Scotland's level as a per-
centage of the employed population was half that of South Wales
and Humberside, and only a quarter of the north-east coast of
England. [134 ] National or regional statistics, of course, masked the
higher densities found in the capital goods sector. The heavy indus-
tries accounted for a third of total union membership in Scotland
in 1892, but, in spite of this, only a quarter of the workforce in this
sector was organised. [135 ] The Webbs found the Clyde to be 'the home
of piece work and contract work, of poverty, drunkeness, cupidity
and competition'. Only the Boilermakers, according to the Webbs,
had 'a really efficient union', while the ASE was 'regarded, both by
employers and other unions, as a benefit society'. [136 ] A micro study of
trade unionism in Dunfermline in 1892 shows only three well-
organised trades: engine keepers, iron moulders and powerloom
tenters. [137 ] As far as the Webbs were concerned the 'Scottish working-
men are ... only thrashed into Trade Unionism by severe depressions
or tempted into it by strikes'. us While things improved to such an
extent in the 1900s and, especially in the period of industrial unrest in

156


-----

1910-14, to contradict the jaundiced views of the Webbs, membership
levels were still subject to continuous fluctuation.
Low union densities necessitated the continuance of informal
workshop organisation if traditional attitudes to rates of pay, work-
loads and access to employment were to be maintained. Lanarkshire
colliers, without regard to the strength of trade unionism in the
country, as late as the 1890s, were said to adhere to the fixed 'darg'
and, according to William Small, union leader, 'to come up at any
time; provided the bottomer can get an empty cage'. [139 ] The Webbs
noted that in the Lothians, miners 'seldom worked ten [days] in a
fortnight and will stay away without the least notice to go to the
races, etc' .[140 ] During industrial disputes unionist and non-unionists
alike could be found on the picket line. Much of the strength of
workgroup organisation and the weakness of official unionism
resulted from the social realities of coalmining. As Alan Campbell
explains, the contract system in mining encouraged labour mobility
and roots were rarely laid down by colliers long enough to establish
strong county unions. Instability was also encouraged by the movement
of workers in and out of the industry. Slumps in other industries, or
exceptionally high wages in mining, brought influxes of new recruits,
but as trade picked up or wages fell most of them left. Thus, the
fluidity of employment and settlement made it difficult to sustain
organisation and collect subscriptions, hence, the emphasis in Lanark-
shire at this time on workgroup organisation; [141 ] a fact reinforced
during the 1894 miners' dispute when of the 70 000 miners on strike
only 30 000 were union members. [142 ] The failure of the dispute saw
membership of the Scottish Miners' Federation (SMF) fall back to
15 700 in 1897, once more putting the emphasis on informal modes
of organisation. [143 ] Employer hostility and trade depressions, thus
remained imposing barriers to effective organisation among miners
in Scotland.
Unofficial resistance also flourished in unskilled trades, particularly
those employing large numbers of females; sometimes using ingenious
methods of struggle. During a dispute in 1900 at the woollen mills
of P & R Sanderson of Galashiels over manning levels, workers won
their demands by refusing to urinate in receptacles provided by
management, thus denying the scouring department its principle sup-
ply of ammonia! [144 ] In Dundee, jute workers, who were predomi-
nantly female, regularly struck work 'with the appearance', it was
said, 'of the spring sun'. [145 ] Indeed, between 1889 and 1906 there
were 82 recorded strikes in the industry involving women. [146 ] As

157


-----

Eleanor Gordon points out, lack of formal organisation did not stop
women organising, rather it affected the way they organised. [147 ]
Women especially found _ad hoc organisation more_ in keeping with
their dual workplace and domestic roles than formal associations.
Their low wages also generally militated against the establishment of
permanent organisations. Spontaneous action suited a largely
unskilled workforce with nothing much to bargain with outside of
their unpredictable ability to disrupt production. [148 ] Thus much of the
organisation was done on an improvised 'off the cuff' basis; howev-
er, in spite of this, Gordon estimates that women workers in Scotland
were involved in over 300 industrial disputes between 1850 and
1914, most of them taking place in the textile industry. [149 ]
Thus, the exigencies of local conditions, the inappropriateness of
national bargaining structures and the general weakness of trade
unionism in Scotland ensured the survival of workshop organisation.
One of the by-products of this was the creation of a space for the
emergence of the shop steward, who was to play such a crucial role
in the industrial disputes on Clydeside during the First World War.
However, the strength of unofficial forms of resistance was in con-
trast to the weak hold union central office had on the rank-and-file
members.
Trade unions were continually beset by conflicts emanating from the
rank-and-file's desire for local autonomy and the determination of the
executive to enhance centralised control over the bargaining process.
Given the strong sense of national identity north of the border, this
conflict was more acute and damaging to the overall interests of
trade unionism in Britain at this time. Scottish workers were said by
the Webbs to be 'anti-English' which prevented 'amalgamation', and
that this 'international jealousy [was] supplemented by a scarcely
concealed rivalry between Edinburgh and Glasgow' .[150 ] Although
there is little evidence to substantiate the impressionistic second
charge of the Webbs, there exists documented opposition among
Scottish unions to joining with English ones. The founding of the
STUC in 1897 was primarily due to the feeling among Scottish
delegates that not enough attention was being paid to matters con-
cerning Scotland in the British Trades Union Congress (TUC).
There was also a conflict over the affiliation of trades councils to
Congress, something which the Scots favoured and the English
unions did not. [151 ] The desire for independence was also expressed
within individual unions. Refusal of the executive of the Boilermakers'
Society to pay strike benefit to their Clydeside members in the 1860s,

158


-----

_Trade Unionism on the March_

1880s and 1890s built up a tradition of enmity between the two
which eventually led to a failed attempt to form a Scottish break-
away union in 1897. [152 ] The refusal of the Liverpool-based executive
of the National Union of Dock Labourers (NUDL) to support a
strike by Glasgow dockers in 1910 caused mass defections there.l [53 ]
Among Scottish miners only the Stirling association was affiliated
to the Miners' Federation of Great Britain (MFGB). [154 ] The strength
of segregation can be gauged by the fact that in 1892 two-thirds of
trade unionists in Scotland were organised in exclusively Scottish
organisations. They included most of the craft-based unions, with
the exception of engineering and shipbuilding workers. [155 ]
Localism led to the growth of a multitude of small and insular
trades unions. On the Clyde alone it was estimated that there were a
hundred unions active in the early years of the twentieth century. Of
those affiliated to the GTC, only 21 of them could claim 500 or more
members locally; 37 claimed less than a hundred. [156 ] Even in the fast
growing centres of trade unionism such as coalmining local autonomy
was the rule rather than the exception. Scottish miners' unions were
based on counties, although nominally linked through the SMF. [157 ]
The existence of a large number of small unions inevitably led to
numerous sectional disputes surrounding the distribution of work.
Demarcation disputes were rife in the shipbuilding and metal
trades. [158 ] The Webbs noted that 'blacklegging each other's disputes
is a very frequent feature of all the minor societies, whilst the ASE
is universally regarded as, in this respect, the common enemy'. [159 ]
Demarcation disputes were also a feature of the building trades, par-
ticularly between bricklayers and masons. [160 ] Sectionalism of this
kind was also fuelled by sectarian rivalry in engineering and ship-
building, as well as coalmining. It was said of the Lanarkshire
coalfields that among Catholic Irish miners 'Protestantism was more
obnoxious than low wages' .[161 ] This point was underscored by miners'
leader, William Small, when he claimed that the weakness of trade
unionism among Lanarkshire miners was due to 'feelings of jealousy
among certain sections of the miners' owing to 'religious differences
and racial differences'. [162 ] The arrival of Lithuanian and Polish immi-
grants in the Scottish coal fields after 1890 further compounded the
ethnic situation and created further divisions among the miners. [1]63
The sectionalism and division which characterised the trade union
movement for much of this period contrasted sharply with the
growing strength of federation among Scottish employers. Scottish
industrialists were raised on the virtues of self-help and individualism

159

and these values instilled in them a steel-like attitude to challenges to
their authority. The Webbs described the engineering and shipbuilding
employers of the west of Scotland as 'able and independent captains
of industry, [whose] attitude with regard to all trades questions is one
of "do what they like with their own"'. [164 ] Recent research has shown
Clydeside employers to be more fiercely anti-union, more willing to
use force to break strikes, and more ready to import replacement
labour, than their counterparts elsewhere in Britain. [165 ] For example,
it was not until the late 1880s that Clydeside employers (reluctantly)
recognised the Boilermakers' Society. [166 ] Subscription by employers to
the ethos of individualism and self-help, however, did not prevent them
combining against organised labour. The East of Scotland Association
of Engineers, the North West Engineering Trades Employers' Associ-
ation, the Shipbuilding Employers' Federation, and the National
Association of Master Builders, were some of the most important
and active employers' associations. Arthur Mcivor's research shows
that by 1914 on Clydeside an extensive matrix of 25 national
employers' organisations and over 80 local associations dealing with
labour matters existed. Most of them grew after 1900; indeed, a
third of them were not listed in the Board of Trades' _Directories_ _of_
_Industrial Associations in 1900._ [167 ]

The organisation of workers and the successful prosecution of
industrial disputes, therefore, had to contend with formidable
impediments. However, as even Patrick Joyce points out, tendencies
within the social relations of production 'to conflict, compromise
and co-operation ... [are] fairly evenly balanced; outcomes being
dependent on the particular balance of forces at play in different his-
torical contexts'. [168 ] It could be argued, that in the period 1900-14,
with the exception of the economic depressions of 1904-05 and

1908-09, the tendency was towards conflict; that was mirrored in the
rise in trade union membership, particularly among the unskilled,
and the increase in the tempo of industrial conflict. Carters formed
themselves into a Scottish association in the 1890s; [169 ] dockers organ-
ised themselves into the NUDL in 1889; farm labourers, with the
assistance of the Aberdeen Trades Council, formed the Scottish Farm
Servants Union in 1912; [170 ] council workers in Glasgow joined the
Municipal Employees' Association in 1904 and by 1914 were around

10 000 strong; [171 ] female jute workers joined the Dundee Mill and
Factory Operative Union in 1906; and the National Federation of
Women Workers was active in organising textile workers in the west
of Scotland from the 1890s. [172 ] The more established unions also
witnessed an expansion in membership in the years 1900-14. The

160


-----

Lanarkshire miners' union grew from 30 000 in 1900 to 40 000 in
1914, [173 ] while the SMF membership stood at 167 000 in 1910, an
increase of 36 000 over 1900; the Scottish Typographical Association
increased from 3800 to 4500 over the same period; the ASRS in-
creased from 3750 to 4832; [174 ] and similar increases were recorded in
engineering and shipbuilding. [175 ] A measure of the progress of union-
isation can also be seen in the rise in affiliations to the GTC, which
stood at 45-85 in the years 1888-1890 and grew to 104 in 1894. [176 ]
Membership, of course, was subject to wide fluctuations in the
event of a downturn in the trade cycle, or the success of a lock-out,
and so on. The established craft unions, with their greater resources,
were understandably better able to withstand these shocks than the
industrial unions of the unskilled. This organisational difference has
led some labour historians, primarily the Webbs, to characterise the
unions of the unskilled by the generic term of 'new unionism'. By this
they meant that they were more prone to strike to achieve their ends,
and, because they were under the leadership of socialists such as Will
Thorne and Tom Mann, more political than the old Lib/Lab unions.
However, the unskilled unions adopted more militant tactics because
they faced a greater problem of recognition and had, like the female
jute workers mentioned earlier, little or nothing to bargain with except
their ability to disrupt production. The noted emphasis on political
activity was due less to socialist leaders and more to do with indus-
trial weakness. The new unions had to be political as only the state
could act on their part to force employers to recognise them. However,
after the first wave of successful strike action in the years 1889-91,
and facing adverse economic conditions and intense employer hostil-
ity, the so-called more militant unions pursued, as Hobsbawm says, a
'cautious, limited, conservative and sectional' industrial strategy, which
included avoiding disputes, accepting arbitration and conciliation
procedures, and so on- the hallmarks of craft unionism. [177 ]Even dur-
ing the peak period of industrial struggle in 1889-90, the traditional
unionised trades of construction, coalmining, metals and textiles
accounted for two-thirds of all recorded stoppages. [178 ] Moreover, as
if to underline the continuity of this pattern of industrial conflict,
during the mass strike wave in Scotland prior to the First World
War nearly 65 per cent of the disputes were located in these three
occupational categories. [179 ]
Thus, there was little difference in strategy and tactics between
skilled and unskilled unions after 1891, perhaps because, as Keith
Burgess argues in the case of the engineers, trade unionists in the
west of Scotland 'conformed most closely to the outlook of New

161


-----

Unionism' . [180 ] In such circumstances there was a general weakening
of the exclusiveness which normally existed between skilled and
unskilled. This was certainly the view of J. C. Thompson, president
of the Aberdeen Trades Council, when introducing a deputation from
the shore labourers, then on strike. Thompson said that he:

Trusted that the members ... would forget that they were
masons, joiners, and so many different sections of tradesmen,
but that they would keep in mind that they were all workmen
and therefore had an interest in the general cause of labour, and
in whatever tended to the advancement and elevation of the
workingman. [181 ]

Richard Price's view of a generalised reaction across all areas of
industry to an intensification of exploitation seems to be borne out
by the experience of Scottish workers. [182 ] Indeed, Arthur Mcivor and
William Kenefick argue that changing work regimes 'were a major
causal factor in the strike wave on Clydeside over 1910-14'. [183 ]
The intensification of exploitation through the implementation of
new technology and stricter codes of industrial discipline fractured
the reciprocity between capital and labour, which historians, such as
Patrick Joyce, had seen as a distinguishing feature of mid-Victorian
industrial relations, [184 ] and elicited a more class-orientated response
from labour. An important example of heightening class antagonisms
in industry was the reaction of apprentices to changes in the labour
process. From the 1890s onwards apprentices were confronting
grievances at work by withdrawing their labour. Allied to this was
the high turnover rate which indicated a lack of job satisfaction and
a growing awareness of exploitation. [185 ] In this climate workers' val-
ues and concerns underwent a transformation, and this resulted in an
improvement in the mechanisms of collective self-defence. Previously,
the workgroup had been the unit of socialisation and organisation,
but as capital became more organised this was increasingly seen as
inadequate. Trade unionism was seen as the only viable form resis-
tance could take, and this realisation saw numbers increase sharply,
particularly among the unskilled. However, although objectively this
situation of rising trade union membership and intensifying class
conflict might have been thought to have radicalised the workers
politically by opening them to alternative definitions of their experi-
ence, as we will see, the relationship between economic and political
change was by no means unproblematic.

##### THE CHALLENGE OF SOCIALISM,

#### 1880-1914

The emergence of socialist groups and parties in the 1880s in the
form of H. M. Hyndman's Social Democratic Federation (SDF) and
William Morris's breakaway Socialist League (SL)- known as the
Scottish Land and Labour League (SLLL) in Scotland- initially did
not represent large discontinuities with previous decades of political
activism. The initial spur came not so much from the socio-economic
concerns of the urban workers, but from problems associated with
the land. Henry George, the American land reformer, in this respect
was a key intellectual influence. It was the publication of his book
_Progress and Poverty (1880) and his lecture tour of Scotland in 1881_
and again in 1884 which provided the stimulus for the interest in
socialist ideas. George's view that poverty was the inevitable result of
the private monopoly of the land resonated with the anti-landlord
tradition of Scottish radicalism and drew a hugely sympathetic
response from the Irish and Highland communities in central Scotland,
particularly as the promulgation of them coincided with the crofters'
struggles in the Highlands and the renewed troubles in Ireland.
Although George's idea of taxing land values to fund the assault on
poverty was later dropped by socialists in favour of land nationali-
sation, the fact that it was the historical language of anti-landlordism
which allowed activists to mobilise workers demonstrated how
powerful the 'radical tradition' was fixed in the popular consciousness
at this time. It was this political tradition and its links to Liberalism
that socialists had to confront to restructure the nature of party
politics in Scotland and elsewhere. But that goal was problematical
since many socialists were brought up in this political culture; a
phenomenon which was reflected in the social profile of the leader-
ship of the early socialist societies.
The leadership cadre remained essentially a product of an alliance

163


-----

between the petty bourgeoisie and the skilled working class, with the
odd disaffected member of the upper middle class and the unskilled
thrown in. The Glasgow branch of the SL had as its founding secretary
James Mavor, professor of political economy at St Mungo's Technical
College and, later, at Toronto University, Canada. Among the branch's
first members were R. F. Muirhead, assistant professor of Greek at
Glasgow University, and Robert Ferguson, the great grandson of
Robert Burns. 'Prominent' among the sympathisers were Sir Donald
M. Stevenson, later, Lord Provost of Glasgow, professor Henry Dyer,
of Glasgow Technical College, McCaulay Stevenson, a well known-
artist, and James Cherrie, cashier at Beardmore and Company.
Mavor stated in his autobiography that the 'original membership of
the branch consisted of [only] a few workingmen'. [186 ] A report of the
Edinburgh branch of the SL gave a membership of fifty-two, of whom
twenty-six were artisans, nine were students, and the rest clerks,
warehousmen and artists, including a few foreign emigres, such as
the French Communard Leo Millet and the Austrian socialist Andreas
Scheu, and one woman. [187 ]The influence of European socialists in the
SL was quite considerable. J. B. Glasier, referring to a party held in
Glasgow with William Morris present, said that, although fairly
small, it was 'noteworthily international in voice as in sentiment. Leo
Millet ... sang "Carmagnole" ... a German comrade, one of a small
group of German glass-blowers ... sang a German worker's song,
and a Russian Jew, a cigar-maker, sang a Yiddish revolutionary
song' .[188 ] The only exception to this social pattern of membership was
Aberdeen, where the early socialists were 'working men and trade
unionists ... the great majority being skilled workers ... only three
could be considered middle class' . [189 ]
However, unlike the radicals of the 1840s and beyond, the early
socialists rejected inclusion into the constitution as the desideratum
of political activity. Members of the SLLL, like Morris, tended to
view parliamentary democracy as a 'sham', and looked towards a
more revolutionary solution to the contradictions of wealth and
poverty. [190 ] However, although revolutionary, these views were not
inspired by Marx. Glasier claimed that workingmen in Scotland
made their 'own way to Socialism without even being in contact ...
with foreign revolutionary influences'. The reading material of the
Glasgow branch of the SL, which was in 'most instances Burns and
Shelley, Carlyle and Ruskin', supported Glasier's opinion. Indeed,
when Morris visited Glasgow in 1884 he 'expressed some surprise',
says Glasier, that:

164


-----

None of us appeared to have read More's _Utopia,_ or any of the
writings of the more definite pre-Marxian socialist thinkers-
Robert Owen, St Simon, Fourier, Loius Blanc, and the like. As for
Marx his writings were ... largely unknown in this country. [191 ]

Further north the situation does not appear to have been much dif-
ferent. James Leatham, journalist and early socialist, says that his
left-wing sympathies developed from his membership of debating
clubs and literary societies in Aberdeen in the 18 80s, where he lis-
tened to debates on all manner of political subjects. This exposure
led him into deeper study and, as a result, he became familiar with
the seminal works on social problems such as 'George's Poverty and
_Progress ... Spencer's Study of Sociology,_ and Darwin' .[192 ]
The eclectic influences and the largely auto-didactic character of
early socialist activists provided them with a critique of the social
relations of capitalist society, but with little else. There was no theory
of politics articulated or any theoretical appreciation of the role of
the state. Thomas Carlyle, the Tory paternalist, figured as highly as
an intellectual influence as romantic idealists such as Percy Shelley.
Although Glasier recognised the need to 'enlist the sympathy of the
miners in our movement and ally them with our propaganda', [193 ]
little was achieved in this direction. On the whole, trade unionists
found the political programme of these organisations 'too wide and
revolutionary in nature' .[194 ] The avant-garde lifestyle and dress of the
more middle-class members also alienated the working class. John
L. Mahon, ironworker and SLLL organiser, derided Glasier as 'a
poetic and cranky ... man. Wants to be a wandering and roving John
Ball and is devoted to Morris's fads and queer ways'Y[5 ] The atheism
of the SLLL also constituted a barrier, as Robert Owen had found
many decades earlier, to attracting members. Andreas Scheu said that
'people would not circulate' _Commonweal_ 'on account of the last
sentence in the manifesto', which claimed 'the religion of Socialism

[is] the only religion which the Socialist League professes' .[196 ]

Political isolation from the working class led to faction and feud,
as well as to petty rivalries within the early socialist societies, and
this did much to bring about their demise. The experience of the
Edinburgh branch of the SLLL is fairly typical of the demoralisation
of the membership as a whole. Within a few months of its establish-
ment the membership was around fifty, but, as one critical member
pointed out:

165


-----

This soon fell to nearer twenty, of that number half were office
bearers who have either left Edinburgh or separated themselves
from the Society. The University members who remain no longer
give us any assistance in fact ... the members of the Edinburgh
University Socialist Society made the discovery a few days ago
that they were not Socialists [and] ... changed the name of their
Society to ... the Edinburgh University Social Reform Club. [197 ]

Lack of interest in the meetings of the SLLL by the Edinburgh workers,
except when prominent members such as Morris were speaking, the
paucity of able propagandists, and poor sales of the _Commonweal,_
all contributed to the collapse of the early socialist movement north
of the border. [198 ]
Failure and the demoralisation that went with it saw the socialists
turn their venom on the working class. An Edinburgh member, Alex
Howie, moaned that 'All things considered ... what an awful duffer
**the British working man** is ... his thick-headedness **is** **awe-inspir-**
ing' .[199 ] Even Glasier could write disparagingly that:

Working men as fathers, brothers, sons, friends, are right
enough. But in relation to their masters and one another in their
workshops, and in relation to their own class interests, they are

         - or, at least, most of them are - sneaks, flunkeys, cowards,
slaves, traitors and nincompoops. [200 ]

These sentiments could not but have alienated skilled workers with
their well-developed sense of independence and craft pride. But
regardless of this, Glasier and other socialists at this time were fight-
ing an uphill political battle in Scotland as the working class was still
heavily imbued with Liberal principles. The strength of such senti-
ments can be guaged from the Glasgow demonstration in favour of
the Third Reform Bill of 1884 and against the Tory-dominated House
of Lords which was trying to obstruct its passage through parliament.
Around 64 000 people marched in the procession and another 200 000
gathered on Glasgow Green to greet the marchers. As Christopher
Smout says: 'They carried countless pictures of Gladstone and many
of Uohn] Bright ... banners from 1832 and from Chartist days ....
The basic message was clear- the "class" obstructed reform, the

"masses" were here to demand it'.[201 ]

Liberalism appealed to Scots workers, particularly the skilled
stratum, because it emphasised free trade, self-help, a dislike of

166


-----

_The Challenge_ _of Socialism_

hereditary privilege, and mild identification with patriotic Scottish or
nationalist sentiments within a federal UK state.[202 ] One might add
that Scottish Liberalism was overwhelmingly Gladstonian and Radical
in its political sympathies. Because of this many Scottish Liberals
supported advanced social legislation. Glasgow Liberals made the city,
according to the _Times,_ 'the centre of the experiment in municipal
socialism'. [203 ] Public ownership was gradually established in a wide
range of utilities, including gas, water, tramways and telephones.
However, as many MPs and prominent supporters in Scotland were
also employers, they were either silent or actively opposed to labour
legislation, such as the eight hour day. There were also tensions
within the Scottish Liberal Association (SLA) over the question of
working-class representation in parliament. The lack of workingmen
as Liberal candidates at elections embittered relations between the
middle class leadership and its working class supporters, as did the
party's failure to support the miners in the 1884 strike. This led to
the revolt by Keir Hardie and others at the Mid-Lanark by-election
in 1888.
Hardie's political intervention although unsuccessful, with even
miners and the Irish in the constituency voting for the recognised
Liberal candidate, [204 ] was, perhaps, the most important and defining
moment in the history of Labour in the west of Scotland until the
1930s. It led to the formation of the short-lived Scottish Labour Party
(SLP), the first organised independent working-class political party
in Scotland. The SLP's political programme, however, with some
exceptions, bore a striking resemblance to that of the radical wing of
the Liberal Party. It included, among other demands, nationalisation
of the land, minerals, railways and banking systems, an eight hour
bill, second ballot, abolition of the House of Lords, home rule for
each country in the British Empire, free education, disestablishment
of the Church of Scotland, prohibition of the liquor traffic and
adult suffrage. [205 ] These demands simply reflected the equally dis-
parate political and social character of the founders, who included
miners' leader, Robert Smillie, Crofters' MP, Dr G. B. Clark, SLLL
representative, J. B. Glasier, eccentric landowner and Lib/Lab MP,
R. B. Cunninghame-Graham, and John Ferguson of the United Irish
League (UIL). [206 ]
Unfortunately, the new party failed to achieve much success among
Scottish trade unions. The GTC in May 1888 refused an invitation
of representation on the council of the SLP, and a year later opposed
a motion urging the trades council to affiliate. [207 ] In spite of his being

167


-----

a miner by occupation, Hardie's organisation only received mild
support from Scottish colliers, with only William Small and Robert
Smillie, among the leadership, being sympathetic. The Scottish railway
strike of 1890-91 also brought no lasting benefits to the SLP as the
secretary of the ASRS in Scotland was opposed to independent
labour politics. The SLP also suffered from the pronounced rivalry
between Edinburgh and Glasgow. Socialists in Edinburgh found the
refusal of the SLP's inaugural meeting to adopt as one of its political
aims the nationalisation of the means of production as reason enough
to keep their distance, and instead the SDF and SLLL branches com-
bined to form the Scottish Socialist Federation (SSF). It was not until
November 1892 that a branch of the SLP was established in the
capital. [208 ]

The general election of 1892 saw the collapse of the SLP as a cred-
ible political party - its seven candidates all performed disastrously.
In any case, the difference between the SLP and the Liberal Party
was to many workers minute, especially since some of the former's
candidates offered themselves as 'True Liberals' instead of Labour
candidates. In spite of this, the SLP's political legacy was important
in shaping the ethos and to a large extent the political programme
of future Labour parties. The British-wide Independent Labour Party
(ILP) was formed in the wake of the SLP's failure in Bradford in
January 1893 with the leading lights of the Scottish organisation
taking an important role in its founding. As the ILP was to dominate
labour politics in Scotland for the next forty years an understanding
of its ideology, ethos and values is important.
The attitudes and values of the ILP in Scotland were those of the
respectable skilled worker and were epitomised in the persona of Keir
Hardie. Socially, Hardie was teetotal; religiously, he was evangelical;
and politically, he was anti-landlord, nationalist, republican and paci-
fist.209 Of these values temperance played an important role in shaping
the outlook of Labour and providing practical experience in pressure
group politics. Membership of temperance societies gave working men
the opportunity to address and conduct meetings and to develop
administrative skills. The numerous campaigns against the liquor
traffic introduced them to political activity. Moreover, the pressure
group politics of temperance was not without success. In 1890 Glasgow
Town Council was forced to ban the sale of drink on council-owned
property. The important ideological spin off from these campaigns was
that it encouraged 'a belief in the larger case for social reform by the
state', for it was only through legislation that alcohol consumption
could be reduced and, ultimately, abolished.[210 ]

168


-----

Ideologically, temperance provided the early socialist movement
with an invaluable critique of industrial society, which linked poverty
and alcohol abuse with economic exploitation. Prominent temper-
ance reformers such as Professor J. Kirk and David Lewis, editor of
the _Reformer_ journal published by ETC, argued that although
alcohol was the main cause of working-class misery- a view shared
by Keir Hardie among others - the working man 'was more sinned
against than sinning'. The worker was the 'helpless victim of
exploitation', whose wretched condition was the responsibility of the
'socially influential'. [211 ] Although much temperance philosophy was
wrapped up in the rhetoric of self-help and popular Liberalism, it
served to indict industrial capitalism on both moral and economic
grounds. At the same time, it held out the prospect of solving the
problem of working-class poverty and this made it attractive to the
early leadership of the ILP. Hardie himself was of the opinion that
poverty was the result of workers' income being poured down 'their
throats in intoxicating drink' .[212 ]

The impact temperance had on the activists within the ILP cannot
be minimised. The main mouthpiece of the party in
Scotland - Forward - refused to accept adverts from the drinks trade
and constantly preached abolition. Harry McShane said of the local
Kingston branch of the ILP that 'It was as much a temperance body
as a socialist one; only one man in it drank'. [213 ] McShane's observation
was underscored by John Paton, ILP organiser, who stated that in
the Aberdeen ILP it was uncommon 'to find drunkards; the great
majority were total abstainers'. [214 ] The Scottish Co-operative move-
ment also took a hostile attitude to drinking among its members and
as a result 'Co-operation and Temperance became synonymous'. [215 ]
In Dundee, the Prohibition Party of Edwin Scrymgeour had the
support of the Jute and Flax workers union and was represented on
the latter's executive. [21] 6
However, anti-drink did not only apply to the more moderate
socialist organisations, parties further to the left also abhorred alcohol.
Tom Bell, of the SDF and, later, Communist Party, believed that 'there
were few greater curses to the workers' movement' than 'drunkenness',
which was a 'disgusting bourgeois method of corruption ... and
ought to be crushed wherever it shows'. Speaking of the Glasgow
branch of the SDF in the 1890s, Bell said that they 'didn't hesitate to
clear out ... habitual drinkers', which was in marked contrast to
the 'beer swilling' leading London members, such as H. W. Lee and
Harry Quelch. [217 ] Opposition to drink was also shared by the inter-
national socialist movement and was a fundamental part of the

169


-----

programme of socialist groups in Germany. Individual members made
a personal commitment to temperance.[218 ]
Anti-drink was only one part of the socialist strategy of moral
improvement in order that workers could be made into the kind of
people the new society was thought to need. Various organisations
were formed to offer wholesome entertainment and healthy pursuits
for young workers. Rambling clubs, ILP cycle scouts, vocational
courses, art circles, musical societies and choirs were additional
aspects of the respectable culture of the early ILP. These initiatives
were in line with artisan traditions of self-improvement which also
affected Marxist parties. The SDF ran its own version of the ILP's
educational and vocational classes. For children, Socialist Sunday
Schools were introduced in the mid-1890s in Glasgow on an initia-
tive of Caroline Martyn, university student and former school teacher
with a high church upbringing, and were attended in the main by the
better of£.2 [19 ] The slum dweller, the unskilled and the poor were
ignored as they were viewed as incapable of attaining the status of
respectability. As Keir Hardie explained: 'It is the intelligent fairly
well-off artisan ... who responds most readily to the Socialist appeal
and it is the slum vote which the Socialist candidate fears most'.[220 ]
George Carson, secretary of the GTC and an ILPer, in evidence to the
Glasgow Municipal Housing Commission on the Housing of the Poor
( 1904 ), stated that the council was opposed to 'the suggestion that the
Corporation should be restricted to the providing of housing ... for
the criminal and vicious classes only. If the Corporation is to build
houses at all, it must be for the thrifty, industrious and sober working
classes'. [221 ] To underline the dominant respectable ethos of the ILP,
_Forward praised itself for_ not being read in the slums of Glasgow. [222 ]
Ian Jack, writing of the nature of his father's socialist beliefs,
although in the inter-war years, captures the skilled worker's fusion
of respectability with politics, remarking that:

For all his socialist convictions I don't think my father ever saw
social division in purely political or economic terms .... it was
an older moral force which generated the most genuine heat in
him, and the class conflict ... was not so much between classes
as internal to each of them; it was 'decent folk' versus the
rest .... A strict application of socialist theory would mean that
we were bound to the Davidsons (crash, thump; 'Where's rna
fuckin' tea') and that we would be bound to them for life.[223 ]

170

The idea of a socialist society being inhabited by beer-swilling wife
beaters, using expletives in place of decent language, was anathema
to politically conscious workers and, as a result, they sought to dis-
tance themselves from the lumpen poor. However, while the poor
were being ignored, in the early 1900s, ILP candidates went out of
their way to appeal to the petty bourgeoisie, particularly the 'small
shopkeepers who have to keep up upon a small income a decent
appearance'. [224 ] Thus, through the operation of a shared concern for
respectability and moral improvement social contacts were forged
between skilled workers and the petty bourgeoisie. And this was
reflected through membership of organisations such as the Scottish
Temperance Association.
Religion also performed an important role in this respect. Most of
the socialist pioneers were advocates of ethical socialism and defined
'Socialism [as] ... an attempt to apply Christian principles to practi-
callife' .[225 ] Hardie himself claimed that he first learnt his 'Socialism
in the New Testament, where I still find my chief inspiration'.[226 ]
David Lowe, in his Souvenirs of Scottish Labour (1919), emphasised
the influence of Jesus and the New Testament on the emerging
labour movement. When speaking of the reaction of socialists to a
conference on 'Why Working Men did not attend places of Worship',
Lowe remarked that 'The most striking feature of the meeting is the
eagerness with which the Socialists who were present in force
applauded any illusion to Christ as a social reformer'. [227 ] The early
Edinburgh ILP journal - the Labour Chronicle - endorsed this view,
describing Jesus as 'a great example of perfect altruism'. [228 ]
The emphasis of the early socialists on the social ethos of
Christianity was in tune with the increasing promulgation of the
social gospel in the Church mentioned earlier. This answered the
charges of earlier generations of radical workers that ministers were
in alliance with the employers. It also prepared the way for a rap-
prochement with the churches and Labour, once the former had come
to realise that British socialism was not as atheistic as its continental
counterpart. In 1891, John Wellwood, of the Elgin Presbytery, played
a leading part in 'helping to organise the fishermen of the Moray
coast on trade union lines in the Northern Seas Fisheries Associ-
ation'.229 During the Scottish railway strike of 1890-91, Professor
Robert Rainy, of New College and the most famous churchman of
his day, spoke on behalf of the strikers at several meetings in which
he criticised the railway directors and approved the ten hour day. In
1889, the Church of Scotland gave its backing to bakery workers in

171


-----

their struggle against Sunday working and this gave rise to concern
over the conditions other workers were labouring under. The Scottish
Shopkeepers and Assistants' Union was welcomed at meetings of the
Glasgow Presbytery, as they were at the Free Church Presbytery. [230 ]
Social concern was given a political touch when middle-class Glasgow
Christian socialists provided the capital to launch Keir Hardie's
_Labour Leader in 1893;[231 ]_ and again when the _United Presbyterian_
_Magazine came out against the Boer War, the only religious journal_
to do so in Scotland. Several leading ministers such as the Rev. John
Glasse, of Edinburgh, and the Rev. Alex Webster, of Aberdeen, were
key figures in the emergence of socialism in these cities. In March

1908, and in the midst of economic depression, the UFC formed a
committee on unemployment and discussions were begun with the
ILP with a view to helping those out of work. By December of that
year 170 of the UFC's 194 churches in Glasgow were providing unem-
ployment relief; something wholeheartedly opposed by evangelical
presbyterians in 1894.[232 ]
The Protestant churches were beginning to embrace the idea that
social problems needed collectivist solutions and, as a result, sup-
ported a series of social reforms, including old age pensions, labour
exchanges, free school meals, abolition of sweat shops, and so on.[233 ]
As Henry Dyer in his book, _The Foundations_ _of Social Politics_

(1899), put it: 'The middle and upper classes ... must make up their
minds to the fact that if a revolution ... is to be avoided, they must
prevent the catastrophe by anticipating the demands of the age, and
be prepared to lead public opinion on social questions'.[234 ] Labour
reciprocated the overture of the Churches when in 1910 _Forward_
published five articles issued by the United Free Church (UFC) on the
'Church and Social Problems'. In October 1911, the UFC organised
'Labour Weeks' at which prominent Labour leaders spoke, including
William Adamson, John Hodge, James Brown and J. R. Clynes, on
social and economic issues from a Christian standpoint. [235 ]
This, of course, does not mean to say that the Scottish churches
had been converted to socialism. On the contrary, many of the clergy
and especially the laity were strongly critical of socialism. J. M. Lang,
of the Barony Church, Aberdeen, and principal of Aberdeen
University (1900-09), who was sympathetic to the trade union
movement, argued that socialism was 'too materialistic, earthy, and
selfish', and warned that 'socialist schemes for expropriation [that
is, nationalisation] came very close to violating the commandment
against stealing'. [236 ] However, in spite of these qualifications, the

172

critique the Scottish churches, particularly the non-established, had
developed against unrestricted competition and exploitation allowed
socialists to remain in the church and for Christian principles to
infuse in an important way the social ethos of the ILP.

Knowing God was on their side may have given moral conviction
to the political demands of the organised working class, but the
influence of religion, like temperance, was not always positive. The
social framework implicit in Christian scriptures stressed the impor-
tance of the family and the subordination of women. No changes were
envisaged in the traditional role of women in society by working-
class radicals. Socialists condemned capitalism because it could not
provide the family wage. As a member of the SDF put it at a meeting
in Dundee in March 1889:

A home ought to be the holiest of holies. The man who per-
formed his duties ought to be able to say - here is my altar of
love, here I shall rest, here I shall withstand the vile tempta-
tions ... of the world .... But what did they do - went home
and gave the baby a bottle- went home and let the wife go out
and earn the dollars. [2]' [7 ]

Not surprisingly women were seen as helpmates rather than as
equals in the political struggle. As Harry McShane recalled, 'women's
activity ... was confined to the social side of the movement. A lot of
women worked around the Socialist Sunday School; and in the
Clarion Scouts they did more of the social type of work than the
propaganda. They often looked after the soup kitchens'. [238 ] Even in
the Co-operative movement, where female members predominated,
they were expected to play a complimentary role to men. Patrick
Dollan said that it was 'not considered good form for women to
appear on the platform at Co-operative or other working class meet-
ings'.239 Perhaps because of the marginalising of women it took until
1912 before the labour movement agreed to oppose any extension
of the franchise which did not include them.[240 ] The failure to address
the issue of gender within the labour movement or to mobilise
women beyond the social, because of the influence of the ideology of
domesticity, therefore, fragmented and fatally weakened the political
challenge of Labour in this period.
Religion also produced sectarianism which more than any other
factor divided the Scottish workers. Religious bigotry saw the Irish
Catholics retreat from the embrace of the Scottish labour movement

173

and into the arms of a reactionary priesthood, which channelled Irish
political energies into the struggle for Home Rule. However, alienation
from the concerns of mainstream political life was perhaps inevitable
for many Irishmen as, prior to the passing of the Representation of
the People Act of 1918, franchise conditions effectively debarred
some 50 per cent of adult males from exercising their voting rights in
Glasgow in the late nineteenth century. [241 ] This situation only rein-
forced traditional interest in Home Rule, religion and community.
Sometimes, as in the Blackfriars and Hutchesontown (later Glasgow
Gorbals) constituency in the 1906 general election, Irish Catholics
might disobey their priests and the UIL and vote Labour; however, it
was a rare occurrence, and was almost certainly never repeated in
local elections. As the Glasgow Observer said Home Rule came first
on the political agenda, but 'once Home Rule were out of the way,
the Labour cause would be our own'. [242 ]
Notwithstanding the political priorities of the Scoto-Irish commu-
nity, the emerging Labour Party had quite a sizeable task trying to
convince the former to ditch their political allegiance to the Liberal
Party. Many Irish Catholics in Scotland were afraid that labour
politics, dominated as they were by men of Protestant backgrounds,
might lead to the introduction of secular education. The STUC
approved by a majority of 52 votes to 31 the introduction of secular
education in all state-aided schools in 1913.[243 ] There was also the
anti-Irish statements of well-known Labour leaders to consider. Hardie
had described the typical Irish immigrant coalminer as having 'a big
shovel, a strong back and a weak brain';[244 ]J. B. Glasier said on hear-
ing of the death of John Kensit of the Protestant Truth Society: 'I
esteem him a martyr ... [and] I feel honest sympathy with his anti-
Romanist crusade';[245 ] and R. B. Cunninghame-Graham called on
Glasgow socialists in his bid for the Calmachie seat in 1892 to protect
him from 'the attacks of reactionary priestcraft' .[246 ] It was partly to
allay Catholic Irish fears concerning the intentions of the ILP that
John Wheatley set up, in spite of the condemnation of the Catholic
Truth Society and certain prominent members of the priesthood,
the Catholic Socialist Society in 1906. On Labour's part there was
a reluctance to put up Catholic candidates at elections for fear of
a Protestant/Unionist backlash. An attempt by the ILP in the 1890s
to form an electoral pact with the UIL in municipal elections in
Glasgow ended in complete disaster, although John O'Hare was
the first Catholic to gain a seat on the Glasgow Town Council in
1897.[247 ]

174


-----

Irish Catholics in the main turned to the Liberal Party as the best
hope for Home Rule; in this sense Labour was a distraction as a vote
for it would allow the Unionists in. This happened in Glasgow in
1892 when Labour candidates, much to the chagrin of the UIL, split
the vote and handed the Unionists three traditional Liberal seats. [248 ]
The Liberal Party had, of course, split on the issue of Irish Home Rule
in 1886 and in the west of Scotland a large minority of enfranchised
workers went over to the Liberal Unionists. The argument that Irish
Home Rule would lead to the break up of the British Empire and to
a loss of markets appealed to Protestant workers in the export trades,
particularly since this appeal was made at a time of depression in
shipbuilding trades.[249 ] From this essentially economistic argument a
divisive Unionist-voting working-class bloc was created and sustained
into the 1950s.
Similarly, the self-righteousness and moralism which flowed from
temperance not only alienated socialists from the vast bulk of Scottish
workers, it also acted as a source of disunity within the labour move-
ment itself. Hardie's own temperance principles led him to condemn
what he saw as the boozy behaviour of London socialists, leading to
his refusal to join the SDf.2[50 ] Even within the ILP divisions emerged
over the question of alcohol. Willie Gallacher, of later Communist
fame, when a member of the ILP and the IOGT, refused to back the
candidature of miners' leader Robert Smillie in Paisley in the 1906
general election because of his connection with a public house trust.
Instead, Gallacher threw his support behind the Liberal, Sir Robert
McCallum, a soap manufacturer. [251 ] Temperance convictions among
socialists also impaired the building of political alliances with the
Scoto-Irish community. Patrick Dollan, prominent ILPer and, later,
Lord Provost of Glasgow, attacked the idea of an electoral alliance
with the UIL in the November 1911 municipal elections because of
its connection with the drinks trade. So vehemently anti-drink was
DoHan that he argued that it was better 'for the labour movement's
prospects electorally to be set back twenty years than to make any
tactical arrangements with the UIL branches which had publican
ties'. [252 ]
The cult of respectability which religion and temperance were
outward signs of weakened the class message of Labour; emphasis
was placed on brotherly love and social justice. Although this made
Labour more attractive to Christian socialists and radical Liberals
among the middle class, it hindered the development of a class analy-
sis of society. Marx was attacked for 'the glorification of the material

175


-----

as opposed to moral forces' and for 'emphasising the necessity of a
class war'. [253 ] In Keir Hardie's political philosophy the 'struggle for
emancipation' was dramatised as 'a battle not between economic
classes but between idlers and labour, managing employers being
included under the term "labour" along with workmen'. [254 ]Indeed, the
only capitalists attacked in _Forward_ at this time were monopolistic
mineowners. [255 ] As a result, there was a general failure within the ILP
to theorise the relationship between the industrial and political spheres
of labour activity. The two arenas of conflict were seen as separate
spheres; a phenomenon which put the stress in the ILP on non-work
relationships.
Housing was the main area of dispute between the ILP and those
on the progressive wing of the Liberal party in Glasgow. Most of the
housing units were owned by small landlords who dominated the
town council and who allied themselves with the Liberals. Therefore,
while important strides were taken in Glasgow in providing for the
public ownership of utilities, the housing market remained an area
which was politically taboo. To reform the market by increasing the
level of municipally-owned housing would have hit the petty bour-
geoisie in the most sensitive place of all - its pocket. Failure to act by
the Liberals on the appalling housing conditions in the city; created a
space for Labour to campaign on the issue of reform. By doing so
Labour was able to build a constituency of support around the lan-
guage of anti-landlordism, which linked the struggle of Irish peasants
and Highland crofters against the rural landlord with the struggle
against the urban landlord. This strategy appealed to both Catholic
and Protestant alike since both communities endured similarly awful
conditions. It also, as Eleanor Gordon points out, allowed women,
particularly housewifes, a more active political role and they took the
initiative in the drive for housing improvement.[256 ] However, although
housing brought together different groups and organisations previ-
ously ignored or excluded, the emphasis on municipal struggles led
the ILP to assume that any 'municipalisation was socialism'. [257 ] Thus,
the opportunity for providing an alternative to popular Liberalism
was limited by the radicalism of the latter in this area.
Stress on localism also prevented Labour from developing a role
for the state in relation to the economy and civil society. Although
the ILP, and the SLP before it, tended to advocate state ownership it
was only intended to be applied to monopolies or inefficient industries.
On the whole, the ILP was highly suspicious of increasing the power
of the state lest that should lead to state capitalism and a reduction

176


-----

_The Challenge_ _of Socialism_

of individual liberty. There were also concerns expressed over
bureaucracy. As J. B. Glasier argued: 'State ownership is as a rule less
Socialistic ... than is municipal or local ownership ... [it is] as yet for
the part a form of State Capitalism. Labour and wage conditions ...
are based upon the usage of capitalist employment'. [258 ] State capital-
ism led to authoritarianism and ran counter to socialism which
was, according to Glasier, designed to 'encourage the utmost possible
freedom of initiative and of self-government to every citizen ... and
every town, or locality'. [259 ] The ILP's commitment to Home Rule for
Scotland, and Ireland, and the attachment of the trade unions to the
doctrines of free trade further encouraged anti-statist attitudes.
The anti-statist sentiments implicit in the campaign for Home Rule
for Scotland was a distinctive feature of the Scottish ILP. These
political sentiments had been inherited from the SLP and the various
radical Liberal groups, such as the Young Scots and the Highland
Land League, in their campaigns to reform the land laws north of the
border and were also deeply embedded in the trade union movement.
Most prominent Labour leaders were supporters of Home Rule,
including Keir Hardie. While this did nothing to enhance support
for the ILP in the Scottish Highlands, which was rock-solid Liberal
or Unionist depending on the constituency after the passing of the
Crofter's Act of 1886, attacks on the landowning class in Scotland
won popularity among urbanised Highlanders. The publication of
Tom Johnston's Our Scotch Noble Families in 1909, described by one
historian as the 'most caustic arraignment of the Scottish aristocracy
ever committed to print',[260 ] sold around 100 000 copies.
The parochial outlook and nationalist sentiments of the ILP com-
bined with the fragmentation of the working class in Scotland made
the formation at this time of a coherent anti-capitalist coalition a
difficult, if not impossible, political project. While housing reform
created the conditions on which a political coalition of interests
could be built, the campaigns attracted little support from the trade
unions. [261 ] Home Rule appealed to those workers in exclusively
Scottish unions, but had little attraction for members of British-wide
unions such as the ASE or the Boilermakers' Society. Indeed, it was the
legal setbacks the unions suffered in the 1890s and early twentieth
century, of which the Taff Vale judgement of 1901-02 was the most
important, which more than anything else convinced organised labour
of the need for independent political representation. Thus the shift of
the unions towards Labour was based on expediency rather than
ideology. The STUC established the Scottish Workers Parliamentary

177


-----

Elections Committee (SWPEC) in January 1900, while the TUC set up
the Labour Representation Committee (LRC) the next month. Mem-
bership of both organisations was boosted by the setbacks of Taff
Vale.
The SWPEC and the LRC proved unsuccessful in elections in
Scotland. In the 1906 general election the SWPEC's five candidates
lost, with the miners remaining loyal to the Liberal Party. The LRC
candidates won two seats out of four and as a result Alexander
Wilkie, secretary of the Shipwrights' Association, was returned for
Dundee and George Barnes, of the ASE, for Glasgow Blackfriars. In
1910 a third MP was added, miners' leader William Adamson, for
West Fife, although now as Labour Party members since the SWPEC
merged with the national Labour Party in 1909. All the newly elected
MPs had pronounced Liberal sympathies. Indeed, Wilkie in his elec-
tion campaign emphasised the help he had given to John Morley at
Newcastle in 1892 and 1895 and also managed to avoid using the
word 'Labour'. [262 ] In the years running up to the outbreak of war in
August 1914, and in spite of a massive increase in industrial strife,
Labour contested five by-elections in Scotland, coming bottom of the
poll in all of them. Although this happened in England as well, the
Scottish share of the poll was much lower, with the Labour candidate
in the mining constituency of Midlothian in 1912 only polling 16
per cent of the total vote and letting the Unionist candidate in.
Things were little better in terms of membership. All through the
1890s the ILP struggled to increase its membership and strengthen its
links with the trade unions. Indeed, many trade unions and trades
councils were reluctant to work with the ILP. [263 ] A coalition of interests
which included the UIL and the Co-operative movement had been
established. However, this collapsed after a poor showing in the
1897 municipal elections in Glasgow and the Co-operative societies
returned to their 'no politics' position, although a number of indi-
vidual Co-operators remained active in Labour politics. [264 ] Christopher
Harvie calculates that in 1900 the Scottish ILP consisted of 1250
members and by 1910 this had only grown to 5000, grouped in 130

branches, fifty of which were situated in colliery districts, and twenty
in textile centres. [265 ] Indeed, the ILP was losing branches faster than
it was creating them with thirteen folding between 1910 and 1914.
This also affected the Labour Party. When the Glasgow Labour Party
was formed in 1912 the Co-operative Defence Association refused to
join unless it changed its name to the 'Progressive Party', and the Irish
also declined to affiliate, although, as we have noted above, the UIL

178

_The Challenge of Socialism_

Blackfriars and Hutchestown branch in defiance of the leadership of
the League supported the Labour candidacy of George Barnes in the

1906 general election. [266 ] The poor state of branch organisation also
had a knock-on effect on the electoral performance of Labour. As
J. O'Connor Kessack put in 1913: 'the organisation in Scotland was
not worth the name of organisation'. Indeed, until 1906 ILP branches
were autonomous bodies and it was only in that year that the Scottish
Divisional Council was formed to co-ordinate activity, with George
Kerr as full-time secretary. Glasgow only got round to appointing a
full-time organiser, JohnS. Taylor, in 1910.[267 ]
However, amid this general shambles a ray of hope came in the
performance of the party at local elections. By 1914 Labour had two
hundred local representatives in Scotland on parish councils, town
and country councils, and school boards. In some areas such as
Leith, Bothwell, Lanarkshire, and Wemyss, Fife, Labour controlled a
third of parish council seats before the war, and in Cambuslang it
controlled eight out of seventeen seats. [268 ] The party did less well in
the large cities and in Glasgow only held nineteen seats out of 75-
however, this figure was an all time high; and in Edinburgh Labour
had three town councillors, the first being elected in 1909, three
school board representatives and one parish councillor when the First
World War broke out. [2]69
###### It is hard to conclude otherwise that what political progress
Labour had achieved before 1910 was at the expense not of the
Liberal Party, but of the revolutionary left. This begs the question of
why Labourism advanced, albeit on a limited basis, where revolution
had failed to attract dissident workers. Part of the answer lies with
the commitment of the trade unions to Lib/Labism, but attention also
has to be paid to the importance of the radical political tradition, of
which Scottish Labour was a child of, and the way this was linked to
perceptions of respectability. The SDF of Hyndman, which could still
claim 1000 members in Scotland by 1911, with Aberdeen a noted
stronghold, and the SL of Morris and their various splinter groups,
such as the Socialist Labour Party (SOCLP) and the British Socialist
Party (BSP), were seen as imported products and not organisations
organically rooted in the Scottish political tradition. With the excep-
tion of the SOCLP, organisations of the revolutionary left were
London-based at a time when the Scottish labour movement had a
separate national identity and Home Rule was part of its political
baggage. Jock Carstairs Matheson of the SOCLP did his party no
favour when he argued that nationalism was a conspiracy which 'had

179


-----

its beginning and its end ... [in] the schemes of the ruling dass'.27°
Anti-parliamentarism was also anathema to the Liberal/democratic
tradition of the organised working class in Scotland. Finally, a large
part of the membership of the revolutionary left was atheistic and
intemperate which as we have seen alienated potential members such
as Keir Hardie.
Greater success was achieved in the industrial field by the revolu-
tionary left. The SOCLP and the shop stewards who graduated from
the Glasgow school teacher John Maclean's classes in Marxist eco-
nomics were active in promoting militancy among the skilled workers
on the Clyde which culminated in the series of events known as 'Red
Clydeside'. However, until the crisis of the war years and the shack-
ling of the official trade union movement by war agreements, there
was little space for them to operate in. It was significant that during
the 1908 depression, which threw thousands of skilled workers on
relief when a Liberal government was in office, it was the ILP which
took the lead in uniting the various strands of the labour movement
against unemployment. [271 ] Whatever the future political development
of the Scottish workers it would be the eclectic, elitist and Calvinist
ILP and not the Marxists which would have the decisive say.
The electoral failure of Labour and the minimal impact of the
Marxist left in this period pose important questions regarding the
relationship between the labour process and politics which were
highlighted at the beginning of this chapter. From the discussion above
it would appear that labour process restructuring produces positive
and negative tendencies in advancing class consciousness among
workers. On the one hand, technological change and the intensifica-
tion of industrial discipline and the wage/effort ratio constantly
threatened the autonomy of the skilled worker in the planning and
execution of his work. Skill specialisation also led to greater labour
mobility and minimised the division between the honourable and
dishonourable sections of the trade. As a consequence of these
growing pressures on skill and income, an ever-expanding group of
demoralised workers looked for a different analysis of their economic
situation beyond that offered by the Lib/Labism of traditional labour
leaders. This created the space for socialists to articulate an alternative
version of class experience, but as Richard Penn points out, the effect
was profoundly contradictory. Socialism stands for the 'unity and
equality of all labour, something which poses a dilemma for the exclu-
siveness of the craft worker' in his desire to retain status and wage
differentials _vis-a-vis_ other workers. [272 ] Although skilled workers

180


-----

played an important part in assisting the unskilled and women to
become organised, it was mainly in trades in which the latter posed
no threat to the former. Few in the skilled stratum were, at this time,
prepared to accept labourers into their unions on an equal footing
with themselves.
Restructuring also results in divisions being created within skilled
trades. Changes in shipbuilding, particularly from wood to iron and
steel, accelerated the frequency of demarcation disputes among ship-
yard workers and fragmented the response of labour in the industry
to increased exploitation. The marginalisation of women's issues
and the policy of restricting females to lower-grade work further inten-
sified the fragmentation of the Scottish working class. Sectarianism
acted as another agent in this process. Moreover, in spite of the fact
that this period saw issues connected with the control of work
assume a greater importance to workers, it remains true that most
strikes were still concerned with wages and hours. A unified response
to changes in the labour process would therefore seem questionable,
although this does not mean that sectoral responses were unimportant.
As we have seen the introduction of the longwall method and in-
creased mechanisation in the coal industry broke up the independent
collier tradition and led to greater solidarity among the workers; a
fact reflected in the higher density of union membership.
Within the sphere of politics the impact of labour process restruc-
turing was also contradictory. While the introduction of new tech-
nologies and work routines may have engendered deep discontent
within the site of production, which in turn led to higher levels of
trade union membership, there is little evidence that it actually
politicised the majority of workers in the direction of socialism.
Workers may have strenuously opposed attempts by management to
intensify the level of exploitation in the workplace, but there was a
glaring failure to link this with the issue of the unequal distribution
of political power; something which was undoubtedly assisted by
the consumerist strategies of the ILP and its inability to theorise
the relationship between the industrial and the political. Outside of
the increasing mania for sport, particularly football, what drove the
Scottish working class to tramp streets in their thousands in the
period 1880-1914 was the struggles surrounding Demos. The largest
political demonstrations were those concerned with the extension of
the franchise in 1884 and those aimed at reducing the powers of the
landowning classes in 1910. Lloyd George's 'People's Budget' and the
elections of 1910 were, indeed, crucial reminders of the continuing

181


-----

power of the radical tradition to raise the political pulse of the
Scottish working class. The attack on the powers of the House of
Lords released the pent-up residual hatred of landlordism endemic
among Scottish and Irish workers. These sentiments were also shared
by Labour leaders, many of whom were tied through their upbringing
and the ethos of respectability into the values of popular Liberalism
as personified in the great Liberal leader, William Ewart Gladstone.
Robert Smillie, the miners' leader, 'revered Gladstone as the greatest
man he had met', and that reverence was echoed in the statements of
other socialists, such as Keir Hardie. [273 ] Add to this the radical nature
of much of the 1906-12 Liberal Government's industrial and social
policies, and its commitment at the level of the local state to munic-
ipal ownership of utilities, and the ILP's view that municipalisation
equalled socialism, it is hardly surprising that Labour found it very
difficult to differentiate itself from the Liberals. David Shackleton,
speaking on behalf of Labour candidate, Alex Wilkie, in Dundee in
the 1906 general election, and recognising the political attachment of
the workers to popular Liberalism, claimed that the 'Labour Party
was going to be the left wing of the Liberal Party, pushing them on
to work'. [274 ]
The political difficulties that Scottish Labour faced in breaking the
hegemony of Liberalism north of the border would appear to under-
line the fact that political consciousness is a complex psychological
construction, shaped by a wide range of social experiences, and that
in its making, in contrast to the view expressed by Richard Price at
the start of the chapter, the world of work exercises an important, but
not an overdeterministic influence. Without the escalation of indus-
trial conflict and the growth of trade unionism generated by the
general restructuring of the labour process, the Labour Party would
probably not have emerged when it did. However, its impact in
Scotland remained limited as it failed to find a means of effectively
relating its political aspirations and language to the experiences of
the broad mass of workers. As a result of differences in the standard
of living, gender, religion, geography, language, recreational and resi-
dential patterns, as well as past political experiences and memories,
the Scottish working class remained even by 1914 culturally diverse.
Given this, it was only a party which adhered to an eclectic philosophy
and possessed a political elasticity which had any hope of welding
the sheer variety of working-class experience into a coherent political
bloc. Although the object of gradually increasing criticisms and ten-
sions, the Liberals performed that role until the crisis years of the

182


-----

_The Challenge of Socialism_

Great War and its immediate aftermath saw their hegemony collapse.
Until then the spaces created by economic and social change were
not large enough for Labour, in spite of its electoral progress and the
linguistic currency of socialism across a broad spectrum of the work-
ing class, to colour in red hues the political map of Scotland.

 INTERPRETATIONS

During the nineteenth century workers in Scotland had been deeply
imbued by the principles and values of popular Liberalism and this
was reflected in the political ethos of the early pioneers of socialism in
Scotland. Their politics rested on the foundations of anti-landlordism,
democracy, nationalism and social justice; principles underscored by
a value system which derived its strength from temperance and reli-
gion. And while Labour after the First World War broke with the
Liberals over economic policy, preferring greater state intervention to
free markets, it was these principles and values which provided the
political zeal and sense of righteous mission to defeat the latter in
the general election in 1922. [1 ] However, the idealism forged in the
struggles to break the hegemony of the Liberal Party in Scotland was
to be dissipated as electoral success and governmental responsibility
shifted Labour to a pragmatic political course, and to a reliance on
the bureaucrat and the planner rather than the people. The radical
tradition which had grown out of the artisanal culture of the nine-
teenth century was dispatched to the historical dustbin as the new
and disturbing forces of economic and technological change pushed
Labour to a more authoritarian and statist alternative to evangelical
socialism; a process which reached its apotheosis in the policies of
the 1945-50 Attlee government.
Labour under the weight of economic depression and mass unem-
ployment was forced to redefine itself and its relationship to other
socialist organisations. Part of that process of redefinition involved
the collapse of a shared political culture of activism with other
socialist groups and the demise of localist traditions. The fluidity of
much of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century socialist politics
had meant that there was no clearly defined party structure and
multi-membership of organisations was common which made joint
demonstrations a feature of political life. [2 ] The inter-war period,
however, witnessed the tightening of party discipline and centralised

187


-----

control which created the conditions for a modus vivendi with capital.
The disaffiliation of the ILP in 1932 and the failure of the General
Strike in 1926 further encouraged this form of political discourse
which sought an all-party and, indeed, quasi-corporatist, solution to
the socio-economic problems of Scotland and, indeed, Britain in the
inter-war years. Moreover, as unemployment, rather than work,
became the major focus of Labour policy, the considerable influence
on the Labour Party exercised by the rank-and-file trade unionists in
Trades and Labour Councils, particularly as regards the election of
parliamentary Labour candidates, was nullified as the Constituency
Labour Party (CLP) assumed all the important political responsibilities
in the 1930s.

The inter-war period is, therefore, of profound importance in
understanding the development of Labour politics in Scotland as the
decades marked the re-making of the party and its ethos. Since the
remaking process was in many ways influenced by the economic and
social changes of the inter-war period they must firstly be analysed
before moving to consider these significant political developments
within the Scottish labour movement.

##### 'STARVING IN THE MIDST OF PLENTY':
 ECONOMIC DEPRESSION AND THE SOCIAL IMPACT OF MASS UNEMPLOYMENT, 1914-1945

Although the First World War and its immediate aftermath brought
economic prosperity and higher standards of material well-being for
many Scots, the climate of optimism soon gave way to despair and
hopelessness as the economy crashed in 1920 following the collapse
of the short-term restocking boom. In the years that followed
Scotland experienced lower rates of economic growth than the rest
of the UK, performed more poorly over a range of industries, and
endured a level of unemployment much higher than the UK average.
The props which had sustained the economy in the late nineteenth
and early twentieth century, that is, state and empire, were blown
away and Scotland paid the price for overconcentration on a narrowly
defined range of industries. All attempts to revive the economy failed
and it was not until the re-armament boom of the late 1930s and the
war itself did the situation improve and unemployment fall.
The problem was of a structural, rather than a cyclical, nature and
as such affected the heavy industries disproportionately to the rest of
the economy. Output in shipbuilding fell from 650 000 tons in 1919
to 74 000 in 1933; a figure lower than in the 1850s. [3 ] In the related
engineering industry exports through Scottish ports fell by 42 per
cent between 1913 and 1937 and in most other industries the story
was the same. The coal industry saw production fall from 42.5m tons
in 1913 to an average of 30m tons, and exports decline by 20 per
cent, during the period 1913-35. Scotland's contribution to total
British steel output fell from 23 per cent in 1920 to under 15 per cent
in 1937, while the iron industry could only produce a mere 36 000
tons in 1936.[4 ]

While areas such as the English Midlands diversified under the
pressure of the collapse of traditional industries into new product lines,
as late as 1935 Scotland was still reliant on staples to take it out of
depression. There were virtually none of the new consumer goods,
such as cars, radios and gramophones, produced in Scotland; nor
was there evidence of any commitment to the electrical and electronics
industries. As Richard Saville points out: 'The engineering industry in
Scotland in 1935 was orientated towards traditional linkages con-
nected with shipbuilding, boilers, locomotives and assorted spe-
cialised engineering work .... Mass production and consumer goods
were neglected'. [5 ] The small population and the low level of demand
in the economy as a result of the slow growth in income, which
only grew by a fifth between 1924 and 1937, made Scotland an
unattractive area for setting up new businesses. Government policies
to encourage firms to relocate in areas of high unemployment through
financial incentives, such as limited tax relief and low interest loans,
failed miserably to create new jobs. Firms were reluctant to move
from the centres of wealth and population and this only intensified
Scotland's dependency on traditional industries.
The social consequence of poor industrial performance was mass
unemployment. Throughout the 1920s unemployment never dropped
below 10 per cent of Scotland's insured workforce, and in the 1930s
it averaged out at 20 per cent. [6 ] The Scottish levels were consistently
higher than those in the UK. For example, in 1924 at 12.4 per cent of
the insured population the rate was 2.1 per cent above the national
average; in the peak depression year of 1932 at 27.7 per cent it was
5.6 per cent higher. Even as late as 1939, and in spite of the rearma-
ment boom, unemployment in Scotland at 15.9 per cent was still 5.1
per cent higher than the UK average? This, of course, ignores the
regional effect which was very powerful as unemployment was much
higher in the west of Scotland than in the east. Motherwell and
Wishaw experienced unemployment rates of 49 and 53 per cent
respectively during late 1932 and early 1933; a level only slightly
lower than it had been in October 1922. There was, however, one
particular blackspot in the east: Dundee. In 1932 there were 37000
persons registered as unemployed and in the jute industry unem-
ployment was running at 50 per cent. [8 ] However, the service-based
economies of Aberdeen and Edinburgh escaped the worst effects of
economic depression and in the 1930s had unemployment rates
more than 10 per cent lower than those in Dundee or Glasgow.
Unemployment affected certain sections of the community more

190

than others. Young schoolleavers suffered disproportionately, as did
older workers. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, about 30 per cent
of unemployed Scots were under 30 years old, and another 20 per
cent were over 55. Much of this was long-term unemployment and
as late as 1938 over 30 per cent of males in the west of Scotland had
been out of work for more than a year, and over 10 per cent for more
than three years. [9 ] Many of the unemployed were skilled male workers
for whom the experience of being out of work was psychologically
devastating. Shipbuilding, which had experienced an average of rate
of unemployment of 29 per cent between 1920 and 1929, saw this
figure increase to 42 per cent in period 1930 and 1938;[10 ] while the
steel industry lost 5000 workers between 1925 and 1936. [11 ] The total
size of the labour force in coalmining contracted in Lanarkshire by
55 per cent between the end of 1920 and the end of 1938; while in
Fife it fell by 2 7 per cent and in the Lothians by 21 per cent. [12 ]
In the past emigration was seen as the answer to unemployment
and this occurred on an unprecedented scale in the 1920s. In the
decade 1921-31 Scotland lost 8 per cent, or 400 000, of its popula-
tion compared to England's 0.5 per cent, and Ireland's 4.5 per cent. [13 ]
However, by the 1930s many of the families who had emigrated in the
1920s were returning home, especially from America, as depression
struck with even greater severity across the Atlantic Ocean. As a
result the outmigration rate in the 1930s fell by three-quarters. Added
pressure came from the rise in population. Scotland experienced a
natural increase in population some 30 per cent higher than England's
in this period. The upshot was that a larger portion of the population
north of the border was looking for work in what could only be
described as a stagnant labour market.
The material experience of unemployment was contradictory;
although poverty increased, Scotland, perhaps as a result of a fall in
prices, experienced better nutritional and health standards which
saw infant mortality rates (IMR) fall quite sharply from a very high
level. Moreover, housing legislation increased the level of public
sector accommodation and improved the supply of basic amenities.
These improvements to a greater or lesser degree were experienced
over most of urban Scotland. The IMR in Aberdeen fell from 95 to
59 per 1000 infants in the age cohort 0-5 years in the 1930s, which,
although putting the city on the same footing as Dundee, was still
substantially higher than Edinburgh. [14 ] Those children in Aberdeen
who survived beyond their fifth year also experienced a small increase
in weight and height in spite of the depression. A typical five year old

191

in Aberdeen in 1928-29 weighed 40.3 lb and measured 41.2 inches;
ten years later the respective figures were 40.7 lb and 42.0 inches. [15 ]
However, in spite of these improvements, John Boyd Orr's Food,
###### Health and Income (1935) showed that the diet of the Scottish poor
was insufficient to maintain health. Diphtheria was rife among chil-
dren, with 15 069 cases reported as late as 1940. Of Glasgow children
evacuated during the war 31 per cent were found to be infested with
fleas and lice, and scabies was common. [16 ] Shoeless children were still
to be found in large numbers in large and small Scottish burghs. In
Craigneuk, near Glasgow, 'only the superior mother shod her children
in summer', the rest, with only 'a pair of trousers, no underpants, a
shirt and a jersey' to their names, 'ran barefooted in school and out
of it' Y Among adults the impact of poverty was no less visible or
devastating. Jennie Lee, while in the mining town of Lochgelly, Fife,
in 1927, spoke of her shock in witnessing its debilitating effect on
one of her former female classmates:

In 1917 she had been a pretty intelligent spirited girl. Now she
had a baby in her arms, another clinging to her skirt and a
slightly older child walking by her side. Ill-health, lack of proper
food, and hopeless poverty were written all over her. Later I saw
where she lived. A wretched insanitary but and ben with hardly
a stick of furniture in it. She had not been brought up like that
any more than I had. But she had fallen in love with a young
miner, married him and children had began to arrive just when
the slump years came catapulting down on our defenceless
villages. He was unemployed for most of the time and when
working, earned almost as little as when on the dole. [18 ]

Notwithstanding these correctives to any optimistic reading of social
conditions in the 1930s, the patchy but visible improvement in health
standards was influenced by the progress being made in housing
construction. One- and two-roomed dwellings continued to house
large sections of the Scottish population, with Aberdeen in 1921
having 37 per cent of its inhabitants living in such accommodation,
which was a little higher than Edinburgh, but much less than
Glasgow or Dundee, where over 60 per cent of the population lived
in this type of cramped dwelling. Moreover, a very high proportion
of working-class families had to share a water closet and had no baths.
An Aberdeen women recalled that in the 1920s fourteen families in
Littlejohn Street had to share two toilets and had 'no gas or electricity,

only an open fire to cook on .... For lighting we used paraffin' .'9
Housing conditions were still so bad for many Glaswegians that James
Stewart, Labour councillor, described the city as 'earth's nearest sub-
urb to hell'.[20 ] William Campbell, the stepson of communist leader
_]._ R. Campbell, confirmed this view in his autobiography, saying of his
family's cramped two-roomed house in Stabcross Street, Anderston,
Glasgow, that:

Our parents established themselves in one room, with my little
brother Archie. All the rest of us [four children] slept in the
other room in large bunks built into a recess. The kitchen con-
sisted of a small gas ring in the corner. The only source of water
was a small basin, with a lavatory next to it. This served all the
tenants on our floor. [21 ]

However, between 1925 and 1935 Aberdeen Town Council like many
other councils embarked on a housing construction programme and
over 2600 two- and three-apartment houses were built. By 1939 over
6000 council houses had been built.[22 ] Motherwell and Wishaw local
authority provided houses for one-seventh, or 9000, of its popula-
tion. In Scotland as a whole the period 1919-39 saw the public
sector assume responsibility for 67 per cent of new housing con-
struction, compared to only 26 per cent in England. [23 ] A move from
an overcrowded and poorly equipped house to a new council flat
was like a dream come true for many working-class families. As an
Aberdeen tenant put it: 'When we got a shift to Froghall Road we
thought we were in a mansion'. [24 ] Although council housing was
generally of a higher standard than the available private rented
accommodation, rents were higher. In Dundee council rents amounted
to between 52 and 46 per cent of the average textile worker's wage.
The Medical Officer of Health for Edinburgh complained that:

###### It is apparently a waste of time ... to convince many people
who live in slums that a £15 house provided with ... electric
light, gas boiler, hot water system, wash house, tub and sink,
drying green and open air all round, is in every possible direction
worth £5 more than the dungeon-like slum devoid of almost
every comfort that a human habitation should possess. [25 ]

For those too poor to afford council rents, the slum was still the only
option. The battle for accommodation continued to encourage the

193


-----

transitory existence of many working-class families. Eddie Milne,
Labour MP, recalled in his autobiography that 'Due to the Aberdeen
habit of "flittin" he attended three different schools before the age of
eleven'. However, even in the slums there were degrees of discomfort.
When ILPer John Paton's family moved to Park Street, Aberdeen, from
his grandmother's flat as a result of his mother's second marriage, he
lived for the 'first time in a house with gas lighting', and his mother
'rejoiced in a sink with cold water laid on in front of the windows of
her kitchen!'. [26 ]
The continued existence of diseases of the poor and the wretched
housing conditions were not only a reflection of high levels of unem-
ployment, but also were a consequence of the generally low levels of
earnings north of the border. For those on state-aided relief there was
a marked change in the sexual character of the claimant. Thus, if the
typical person in receipt of poor relief before 1914 was a woman,
who was widowed, sick or disabled; then in 1938 half of those on
the Poor Law were men. Before 1914 there were few areas where
more than 5 per cent of the population were claiming poor relief.
After 1920 the Poor Law disabled roll in Bridgeton, Gorbals and
Cowcaddens in Glasgow accounted for 40 per cent of the population
of these districtsP An expatriate Scot returning to Glasgow in the
early 1930s after twenty or so years in the USA observed that: 'Most
of my boyhood pals are still in the Gallowgate. Some of them haven't
had a job in their lives and have been living off the parish. The rest
are on the "buroo"'. [28 ] The introduction of the Means Test in 1932
led to further deterioration in the living standards of those on relief
by reducing their incomes and splitting up their families.
For those in work the period 1931-33 saw Scots earn only 87 per
cent of the UK average wage; however, some sections of society did
better than others. The salaried middle class experienced a 10 per cent
increase in nominal wages in the 1920s while Scottish workers' wages
remained stagnant or fell. The miners, for example, with the failure
of the 1926 strike, saw their minimum wage fall from 9s 4d to
8s 4.8d per day for an extra hour's work. [29 ] However, there was in a
number of trades a narrowing of the differentials between skilled
and unskilled workers, which led to an improvement in the standard
of living of the latter. In shipbuilding a labourer's wage in 1914 was
only 57 per cent of that received by a skilled worker, but by 1932 it
had risen to 68 per cent. [30 ] This trend was also witnessed in con-
struction, coalmining and engineering during the years 1914 and
1930. [31 ]

Life for those on welfare was desperate, but in spite of the harsh-
ness and, after 1932 following the introduction of the Means Test,
the humiliation of it, the payment of relief allowed the recipients a
measure of dignity. They kept a roof over their heads and were able
to hang on to their furniture and other possessions. Those in work
found that, although their incomes did not increase substantially, due
to the general fall in prices they were no worse off than normally.
However, the poor standards of housing and the large degree of over-
crowding which was a major source of ill-health continued to blight
the lives of many Scottish working-class families.

###### Chapter 21

##### BILLIES AND DANS IN THE JAZZ AGE:
 WORKING-CLASS CULTURE AND THE LABOUR MOVEMENT
 IN SCOTLAND, 1914-1945

The existence of mass unemployment and the poverty which flowed
from it obviously impacted itself in powerful ways on the culture of
the Scottish working class. For many of the unemployed men of the

1920s and, especially, the 1930s, hanging around street corners
'offering each other opinions on everything from how prosperity
could be regained to what had the best chance in the 3.30 [race]' was
all that poverty afforded them in the way of leisure. [32 ] However, for
others escapism and hedonism seem more apt descriptions of their
experience than social puritanism. While the labour movement
decried the influence of American jazz, describing it as 'jungle
music', [33 ] and condemned the growth of dance halls and the cinema -
the 'opium dens' of yesterday[34 ]- the working class remained oblivious
to this kind of moralising. The Carnegie Trust sponsored investigations
into the social condition of the unemployed in the 1930s found that

80 per cent of the young unemployed attended the cinema at least
once a week. [35 ] Dancing was also popular and dance halls flourished
in most towns and cities in Scotland during the 1920s and 1930s.
The unrespectable working-class pastime of betting on horses was
added to by the growth in popularity of dog racing and the football
pools. A Dundonian worker recalled that, in spite of the existence of
mass unemployment, the 1930s were 'surprisingly a good time for
bookies .... The Howff, with as many as 400 punters in it at times,
was nicknamed the Paddock'. [36 ] Workers in Glasgow were said,
much to the displeasure of Alaskan adventurer Kenneth Mackenzie,
to be more 'interested in the Noon Record or who is favourite in the
next race ... than in listening to yarns about Alaska'. [37 ] Keeping and

196

racing whippets became very popular among miners in the west of
Scotland. [38 ] Indeed, so concerned were the religious authorities over
this unashamed hedonism that the Archbishop of Canterbury claimed
that 'the country had gone to the dogs'. Football also continued to
exercise a hold on the imagination of the working class, although in
Glasgow its association with sectarianism became even more marked
as Celtic began to fly the flag of the Irish Free State at its stadium and
Rangers flew the Union Jack and adopted a policy of only signing
Protestant players. The Protestant Billy Boys and the Catholic Norman
Congs fought out ritual religious battles on the streets of Glasgow
and on the terraces of Parkhead and Ibrox. [39 ]
Then there was the traditional culture of drinking. Ironically,
alcohol consumption began to fall quite sharply in the inter-war
period, with consumption in the 1930s a little over a quarter of that
in the 1900s, but that owed more to excise duty and the reduction in
drinking hours than organised temperance opposition.[40 ] In spite of
this, a distinction has to be made between the total volume of alcohol
consumed and the amount of drunkenness. Edwin Muir, in his
impressionistic report on social conditions in Scotland in the 1930s,
observed that among working-class Scots drinking had become more
of a spasmodic and intense experience which meant that its impact
was all the more degrading. Even in the streets of Edinburgh it was
impossible, according to Muir, to 'get through a single evening with-
out seeing at least one example of outrageous and helpless drunken-
ness'.41 The impact of drink on the household economy of workers,
and particularly on married women and children, also remained no
less devastating than in the nineteenth century. One contemporary
caught the desperation of women faced with hard-drinking husbands
and trying to ensure family survival, when he remarked that:

###### It was a job for women to catch up with their husbands before
the week's wages had disappeared and there was nothing left to
buy the household food. Families sought fathers, calling out
names along the streets or in pub doorways. [42 ]

When the women protested too much a beating was often the result.
Patrick McGeown, steel smelter, remembered women in the small
industrial town of Craigneuk being battered 'in public houses' on
Fridays and Saturdays by their drunken husbands for having the
temerity to demand a share of their wages. [43 ] Drink, then, not only
offered escape, but was an important ingredient in defining masculine

culture in working-class communities. The world of sawdust floors
and spittoons, halfs an' halfs, remained closed to women in this period,
which only reinforced the male-bounded nature of public drinking
and the patriarchialism it reflected.

Parallelling this rough culture was temperance, the healthy outdoor
pursuits of hill-walking and amateur sport, as well as self-improve-
ment classes, which the respectable working class remained drawn
to. Temperance was still an article of faith for the respectable working
class, as well as the labour movement. In 1920 the famous 'No
Licence Campaign' involved a large input from the ILP in an attempt
to introduce 'dry areas' in Scotland. Its outstanding failure, with 508
burghs voting for 'No Change', and only 41 for 'No Licence',
demonstrated how remote these nineteenth-century values were
becoming. However, in spite of this, twelve months later the STUC
endorsed a resolution moved by William Leonard, of the Glasgow
Trades Council (GTC) that: 'this Congress reaffirms its opinion that
the total prohibition of the manufacture and sale of intoxicating
liquors ... will be a great advantage to the workers of this country'.
This view was shared by the ILP, which claimed that 'The liquor
trade was the most insidious form of capitalist exploitation'. [44] 1t was
interesting that most of the fourteen votes Dundee prohibitionist MP,
Edwin Scrymgeour, received for his draconian Liquor Traffic Bill in
1923, which included a five years jail sentence for trafficking in
alcohol, came from Scottish ILP MPs, such as James Maxton and
Tom Johnston.
The labour movement also encouraged the development of art
societies and clubs in order to promote greater cultural awareness
among workers, expecting that this would unleash the beginnings of
a proletarian renaissance in Scotland. The Glasgow Socialist Art
Circle's first exhibition in 1925 drew an attendance of between 6000
and 7000 Glaswegians. P. J. Dollan claimed that it marked the
'dawn[ing] of the revolution in culture' .[45 ] This initiative added to the
already impressive list of labour organisations offering wholesome
entertainment and outdoor activities to young workers. The pre-1914
Socialist Rambling Clubs and ILP Cycle Scouts continued to attract
respectable numbers of young socialists. Additionally, there were
Socialist and Labour football leagues. For the less energetic there
were vocational classes, such as the Girls' Handicraft Classes run by
the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP) in the 1930s, and various choirs -
the most famous being the Glasgow Orpheus Choir under conductor
Hugh Roberton. [4]6

_Working-Class Culture and the Labour Movement in Scotland_

However, not all these healthy life activities were initiated by
socialist bodies. Hill-walking and mountain climbing among the
unemployed became popular in the 1920s and 1930s with clubs such
as the Craig Dhu, Ptarmigan and the Lomonds being established on
'democratic' lines. [47 ] Cycling was also a popular pastime with
employed and unemployed workers alike. David Phillips, in his auto-
biography, said that in Dundee on Saturday afternoons 'like great
flocks of colourful birds congregating in preparation for migrating
the cycling clubs gathered ... at the imposing gates of Camperdown
Park'. [48 ]

As much of the sporting and other activities were geared towards
protecting youth from corruption and vice a crucial element in this
project was the encouragement of stable family life. Capitalism was
attacked by socialists because 'it played havoc with the rich blessing
of family life'. [49 ] In practice, what this meant was the virtual subor-
dination of women both in the home and the labour movement. The
constant problem of keeping cramped living space tidy and clean,
providing meals cooked on open hearths, doing the washing by
hand, dealing with the endless demands of young children, made
housework an arduous full-time occupation. For those women in work
the situation was even more burdensome. Margaret Brooksbank, a
mill worker in Dundee, claimed it was 'a common sight to see women,
after a long ten hour day in the mill, running to the steam wash-
houses with the family washing'. [50 ] The patriarchal structure of the
working-class home meant that males were absolved from contribut-
ing to the daily chores. As a stonemason's daughter recalled: 'They

[father and brothers] didn't have to do anything in the house. We
used to have to wash out their gloves and clean their patent shoes to
let them away to the dancing'."

Even in the labour movement the role mapped out for women was
little different. As Harry McShane remarked, most socialists envisaged
no alterations in the sexual division of labour or in contemporary
family arrangements. [52 ] Free love and casual relationships were con-
sidered a threat to the family. Labour leader, Tom Johnston, after
visiting the Soviet Union in 1934, was able to reassure readers in
_Forward that, in spite of easy divorce and casual unions, 'the majority_
of couples in Russia ... live all their lives together', and concluded
'that is a great good fortune to the world, is it not?'. [53 ] As a result of
this attachment to traditional family structures, birth control was
strongly opposed, and Forward itself refused to take advertising copy
from advocates of providing information and advice on the subject.

Dora Russell, of the Workers' Birth Control Group, excoriated the
Clydeside MPs for opposing Thurtle's Local Authorities (Birth
Control) Enabling Bill of 1926, which would have allowed local
health boards to disseminate information regarding contraception
among working-class women, blaming their reluctance on 'the shadow
of threatened religious opposition'. Indeed, the Catholic Church
placed pressure on Labour candidates by sending them questionaires
regarding their attitudes to moral questions. JohnS. Clarke, Labour
MP for Maryhill and noted Marxist, had to give the Church an
assurance in the 1929 general election that he 'would oppose any
legislation on Birth Control'. [54 ]
The stress on family values was in many ways the result of the
continuing influence of religion in Scottish society. Research into
attendance and membership of religious institutions in the inter-war
period by Callum Brown has shown that, in spite of a dip in affiliation
in the aftermath of the General Strike, the Protestant churches suf-
fered no significant loss of adult members, with the Catholic Church
making steady gains. Moreover, if 'active' church membership is
measured by those taking communion at least once a year, then Brown
sees a marked rise in active membership in the Church of Scotland in
the period 1918-25, and again in the economic downturn of
1937-38. The labour movement in this context was eager to prove
its Christian credentials and in 1922 _Forward_ assured its readers
that, contrary to claims by Tory churchmen, 'Atheism avowed or
otherwise has no place in the ILP policy or programme'. [55 ] This was
underscored during the service of dedication held in St Andrew's
Hall, Glasgow, following the electoral victory in the 1922 general
election, when the crowd sang the 124th psalm - 'Had not the Lord
been on our side'.
The strength of religious conviction was bolstered by the continuing
existence of sectarian rivalries in Scotland. Any hope that the expe-
rience of the war would have marginalised these religious hatreds
and tensions was lost as competition for work intensified after 1920
and provided fertile soil for the resurrection of sectarianism. Catholic
workers were still faced with adverts in the job columns of the
press saying that they need not apply. [56 ] However, rivalry could be
expressed in more innocent, but no less revealing, ways in local
communities. In Craigneuk, Patrick McGeown said that the amateur
football team he played for - Cowie Square Wanderers - had a red
strip which represented a 'compromise; the Irish section wouldn't
wear the blue of Scotland, and the Scots wouldn't wear the green of

Ireland'. Community rivalry in this area intruded into the arena of
industrial relations during the 1921 miners' dispute. Locked-out
Catholic miners built a holy shrine at Carfin near Motherwell,
which attracted tens of thousands of pilgrims.[57 ]
Churchmen and Protestant rabble rousers, such as John Cormack
and his Protestant Action Society (PAS), as well as nationalists and
political commentators, fuelled these sectarian rivalries by claiming
that the Catholic Irish were denying native Presbyterian Scots the
opportunity of finding work. The Tory Lord Scone summed up the
position of the anti-Irish coalition when he claimed that: 'If the Irish
in Scotland were reduced to even a quarter of a million, the unem-
ployment problem in this country would be so small as to be negli-
gible'.58 In 1923 the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland
published a pamphlet entitled The Menace _of the Irish Race to_ _Our_
_Scottish Nationality, and the influential Scottish intellectual Andrew_
Gibb, in his book, _Scotland in Eclipse,_ underscored the feelings of
the church when he claimed that the Irish were 'responsible for most
of the crime committed in Scotland, which otherwise would be the
most law-abiding [country] in the world'. [59 ]
Religious and racial propaganda was taken further by the PAS in
Edinburgh and in Glasgow by the Scottish Protestant League (SPL).
Both organisations saw as their political task, as the leader of the
SPL - Alexander Ratcliffe - put it, to 'Kick the Pope! That is our
job! It is our programme!'. [60 ] However, in Edinburgh this led to riots
in 1935 in which Catholic conferences were attacked by angry mobs
and priests and parishioners alike were spat on and beaten up in the
streets. [61 ] The small beleaguered Catholic community of Edinburgh
located in clearly defined areas of the Old Town was unable to resist
the extremist tactics of the PAS, and it was only the onset of war in
the late 1930s that saw these attacks diminished as hatred was turned
towards the Italian community, and the authorities began to take a
tougher stance on sectarian violence. In Glasgow, the SPL pursued a
more constitutional strategy, preferring to work through regular
political channels. Any violence that did occur in the west of Scotland
tended to be between rival sectarian gangs. Part of the reason for this
may have been due to the fact that Glasgow had a more varied resi-
dential pattern, as well as the obvious fact of the size of the Catholic
community. Nevertheless, the emergence of Protestant extremism in
the 1930s demonstrates the continuing strength of sectarianism among
workers in Scotland, and the way that mass unemployment produced
irrational patterns of social and political behaviour even among the

skilled stratum and the better educated members of Scottish society.

Perhaps the level of hostility between Catholics and Protestant
workers was also fuelled by the educational system. Catholic schools
were absorbed by the state through the Education Act of 1918. This
put 'Rome on the rates', according to the Protestant churches, as reli-
giously segregated schools were established. However, all denomina-
tional schools operated within the meritocratic culture inherited
from the nineteenth century. A typology of education was developed
in the inter-war period which was closely linked to job orientation and
social class. For the child deemed 'academic' and 'endowed by nature
with the mental equipment' a secondary education was provided as a
preparation for the professions or university; for the 'non-academic'
an elementary schooling in advanced divisions for older pupils was
all that was on offer until leaving school at fourteen. In 1936 all
post-primary educational establishments were renamed secondary
schools and were divided into three year junior secondaries for
those of 'distinctly limited intelligence'' and five year elitist senior
secondaries. As late as 1951, 87 per cent of young Scots between the
ages of 20 and 24 had left school at fifteen or younger. [62 ] However,
the existence of a ladder of merit provided social mobility for the
gifted working-class child and confirmed middle-class male stereo-
types of the dullard worker and the mentally inferior woman.
The provision of mass education and the development of mass
commercial leisure pursuits, such as the cinema, which made the
older forms of community entertainment and the wholesome activities
of the labour movement, with its self-improving ethos, seem outdated
demonstrated a culture in transition. The cheapness of it all, including
the radio, even allowed the unemployed to participate in a limited
fashion in the new mass culture. Something corresponding to a
homogeneous national working-class experience began to emerge in
this period. Indeed, Carnegie investigators found that there was little
to distinguish the lifestyles of unemployed youths in Glasgow with
similar groups in England and Wales. [63 ] However, although converging,
it was still a masculine culture in which wives served husbands and
daughters fathers and brothers. Moreover, sectarianism continued to
act as a divisive force within the working class and the wider society,
disturbing the solidarities of class based on common or shared expe-
riences. The homogenisation of culture was, therefore, by no means
all-pervasive, but the movement towards it was also underscored by
changes occurring in the labour process, which to a large extent was
breaking down the barrier of skill, although, as we shall see, not that
of gender.

##### TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AND THE SKILLED WORKER, 1914-1945

Overall, the period 1914-1939 was marked by a large-scale accre-
tion in employer power as mass unemployment and a decline in trade
union membership weakened worker resistance to the imperatives of
capital and the impact of technological change on the distribution of
skills in the workplace. Employers took advantage of favourable
conditions to reorganise working methods and introduce scientific
management regimes, such as the Bedaux system, all of which threat-
ened the integrity of craft and workshop control over production
built up during the First World War. As part of this trend almost all
trades were subject to an intensification in industrial discipline and to
general speed ups in production. However, like other periods of change
in the labour process, the impact was unevenly experienced. Some
trades, such as engineering and coalmining, which lent themselves to
greater mechanisation experienced a more profound restructuring of
skill than others. Shipbuilding, for instance, remained wedded to
labour intensive methods of production and as a result continued to
place a premium on skill. Moreover, even in trades subject to intense
reorganisation of working methods, inherited work practices and
customs acted to obstruct attempts by employers to establish complete
domination of the labour process. Therefore, in spite of the enhance-
ment of employer power in the 1920s and 1930s, deskilling was
limited and changes in the social relations of production proved on
the whole to be incremental rather than revolutionary.
Among the large employers of labour, coalmining and engineering
probably experienced the greatest number of changes, although the
same could be said of smaller and less studied trades, such as jute.
They too underwent a profound reorganisation of production
processes. However, because of the high levels of industrial conflict
which characterised workplace relations in coal and engineering in

the 1920s, the historical spotlight has been more directly focused on
them. Indeed, coalmining has been the subject of inumerable studies
into the changing nature of skill and work practices. All of them
point to the increasing mechanisation of coalmining and the impact
this had on the traditional skills of hewers. The mechanisation of
coal-getting had been developing since the 1900s, but during the
inter-war years increased competition and falling profit margins
drove the coal companies in Scotland even further down this road. In
1925, 50 per cent of coal output in Scotland was mechanically cut
compared to only 20 per cent for Great Britain; ten years later the
respective figures were 71.6 per cent and 59 per cent. Additionally
the use of mechanical coal conveyors was more advanced in Scotland
than in the rest of Britain, although still someway behind France,
where mechanised production in the Nord rose from 4 per cent in
1913 to 86 per cent in 1927.[64 ] As a result of the application of
machinery output per miner was higher in Scotland than in the rest
of Britain. Even in areas where mines were small output per man
year was higher than the British average until the 1930s. In Clack-
mannanshire output was 20-30 per cent above the Scottish average
and 35-40 per cent higher than the British; and, in spite of serious
physical problems in extracting coal, miner productivity in
Lanarkshire remained higher than the Scottish average for most of
the inter-war years. [6]5
The gains in productivity did little to increase the profits of the
Scottish coal companies; [66 ] however, the way they were manufactured
had devastating effects on the skill and the health of miners. A study
of the impact of mechanisation on mining skills carried out in the
1930s concluded that physical strength had replaced skill in the coal
industry. As a consequence, 'the skilled miner- hitherto one of the
most independent of workmen in the country, is now reduced to
the status of a living tool' .67 The elimination by machines of the old
hewing skills of holing and undercutting coal and the widespread
introduction of a twenty-four hour production regime allowed the
coal companies, as Stuart Macintyre has argued, to 'replace older
miners with unskilled, but more vigorous, men, and lent itself to

"speed ups" and general intensification of the work process'. [68 ]
However, Macintyre's pessimistic view has been challenged by Barry
Supple. In his official history of the coal industry, Supple argues that
mechanisation did not so much reduce mining skills as change their
nature, and that the operation of the new machinery, such as coal
cutters, and its maintenance called for a high degree of 'proficiency

_Technological Change and the Skilled Worker_

and training'. [69 ] Underscoring this view to some extent was the fact
that the traditional 'pillar and stoop' method of coal-getting persisted
in parts of Clackmannanshire, West Lothians and over most of
Ayrshire right up until the outbreak of war in 1939.7° The smallness
of many pits in the west of Scotland made it uneconomical to adopt
the new technology of coal-getting and, thus, traditional hand-got coal
methods still found favour. Thus, deskilling was far from complete
and the changes that occurred involved a recomposition of old and
the introduction of new skills.
However, in spite of the incompleteness and incremental nature of
technological change, Supple appears to have gone too far in playing
down the degeneration of skill and health encouraged by mechani-
sation. Even he admits that intensive machine mining altered the
'character of pit work. Strength rather than dexterity or experience
was becoming paramount' .7 [1 ]Moreover, the impact of mechanisation
turned the miners and their families from being among the healthiest
of sections of the working class to one of the least. Health reports for
coalmining in the period 1932-39 reveal an abnormally high incidence
of acute and chronic sickness among the workforce. Doctors also
reported unusually high rates of psychosomatic and pyschoneurotic
illness among the minersJ[2 ]

Another result of the adoption of mechanisation was the creation
of a new division of labour in the mines. Under the 'pillar and stoop'
method small teams of workers under the leadership of the indepen-
dent collier were responsible for the whole operation of coal-getting.
Mechanisation, on the other hand, called for a multiple shift system
employing larger teams of workers, each performing a specialised
part of the mining process. A hierarchy was formed rising from the
lowly unskilled 'oncost' men, employed on such tasks as haulage,
through to intermediate groups of drawers and roadmen, to the elite
groups of hewers and machine setters.7[3 ] While under the traditional
system the team leader was responsible for the discipline, hiring and
payment of the team, in the new system the 'oncost' men were paid
by the day and the elite groups of miners by the piece. The potential
for inter-work and inter-community rivalry was implicit in the new
division of labour, particularly when set against a background of
intense competition for work; however, this was offset by the fact
that under the shift system workers became dependent 'not only on
each other but on workers on other shifts' .7[4 ] Moreover, as Macintyre
points out, the mechanised form of longwall mining fostered griev-
ances uniting different grades of the workforce in common hostility

to the company.7[5 ] Therefore, the new system of coal-getting, in spite
of its generally degrading and divisive character, contained within it
the basis of a new form of miner solidarity based on dependency and
shared grievances.
Engineering also experienced a redistribution of skills; a process
which had begun during the war years. The firm of Mavor and
Coulson was of the opinion that what it had learned in the production
of munitions could be applied to industrial production once the war
was over. The lesson, which was boldly stated in the firm's in-house
magazine, was that the post-war engineering industry would require
a new division of labour which involved 'highly specialised machinery
and a staff of skilled supervisors and tool makers ... total operations

[however] are reduced to so simple a character that they can be per-
formed by unskilled labour' .7[6 ] This production strategy was put into
operation in the inter-war years by the larger firms and significantly
altered the balance between skilled and semi-skilled workers in the
industry, and also led to a new division of labour among time-served
men. In 1914 skilled workers made up 60 per cent of the total work-
force in the engineering industry, while semi-skilled workers accounted
for 20 per cent, with the unskilled making up the rest. Seventeen
years later the respective figures were 32 per cent skilled, 57 per cent
semi-skilled and 15 per cent unskilled. Additionally women workers
were more prominent, rising from 3 per cent of the total number of
operatives in 1907 to 13.2 per cent in 1935. Interestingly Noriel's
study of the distribution of engineering skills in the Renault plant in
France arrived at similar conclusions with the number of skilled
employees falling from 70 per cent of the total workforce in 1914 to
under half in 1927.7[7 ] However, as Alan McKinlay points out, these
national figures were in some ways misleading, distorted by the
severity of the depression. It was, he claims, 'widely recognised that

[on Clydeside] the overwhelming majority of semi-skilled workers
were in fact time-served engineers'. [78 ]
In spite of this qualification, the inter-war period saw engineering
craft workers experience downward mobility as the distinctions
between them and semi-skilled workers became increasingly blurred.
Although McKinlay puts this down to a recategorisation of skill
rather than mechanisation/[9 ] this fails to recognise adequately the
degree of deskilling the two most important branches of the trade -
fitting and turning - were subject to in this period. Engineering fitters
were becoming more specialised as long-run batch work encouraged
repetitive forms of manufacturing and limited the need for the all-round

206


-----

_Technological Change and the Skilled Worker_

skills of fitting. Even in the tool-rooms, where the highest degree of
skill was practised, specialisation, as Yates notes, was on the 'increase,
and the range of work encountered [by the fitter] ... is less'. [80 ] In
turning, the introduction of better machine tools after 1918 lowered
the range of skills and severely reduced the number of lathe operations
performed by the turner. [81 ]
Specialisation also had two important knock-on effects: firstly, on
apprenticeship; and, secondly, on the hierarchy of the workplace.
Throughout the 1920s apprentices were used as 'cheap labour for the
bosses', according to the Amalgamated Engineering Union (AEU). A
charge given substance by the employers who recognised 'that large
numbers of boys and youths are not apprenticed but are learning and
eventually taking their places in the skilled categories in the same
way as apprentices. This movement ... will be encouraged by the
tendency of the industry towards simplification and sub-division of
operations'. [82 ] Ten years later an enquiry by the AEU found that only
16 per cent of 1332 'fair sized' engineering firms engaged appren-
tices. [83 ] Such was the degree of specialisation that striking engineering
apprentices on Clydeside in 1937 not only demanded higher pay,
but also the opportunity 'to become brilliant mechanics, a chance
which their employers denied them'. [84 ] The AEU was powerless to
prevent the drift towards 'picking up' as the numbers of apprentices
on Clydeside in membership declined from 20 per cent in 1920 to
only 4.5 per cent in 1929 and were still falling. An attempt to arrest
the decline in apprentice membership by the Glasgow AEU ended
in failure when its Guild of Youth, established in 1928, collapsed
within a year of founding. [85 ]
The increase in the number of learners accompanied the creation
of a new hierarchy within the engineering workforce. In the fitting
trade an elite cadre of workmen, comprising around a third of fitters,
was evolving, centred on the tool room. Below this elite group, fitting
became a trade divided into 'a multitude of sub-divisions none of
which utilised the full range of fitting skills and techniques'. [86 ] In the
turning trade a distinction was made between the 70 per cent of
'rough' turners and the 30 per cent of 'finishers'Y As McKinlay
also recognises, the progressive deskilling of the engineering worker
was underscored by a more intensive regime of industrial discipline
which only served to reinforce the engineer's sense of loss and impo-
tence. After the 1922 lock-out Clydeside employers abolished the
traditional convention of 'minutes of grace' at starting times and
meal breaks; and in Edinburgh 'speeding up and time-checking even

for the lavatory has been brought to a fine art'. [88 ] Additionally petty
restrictions were introduced, such as bans on smoking at work,
designed to reinforce supervisory authority. Movement within the
workplace was also restricted by utilising labourers and specialist
workmen to prepare and deliver the jigs and fixtures required for
forthcoming work. One engineer serving his apprenticeship in the
1930s with Brown Brothers, Leith, caught the essence of the new
disciplinary regime when he recalled that:

###### If I went and spoke to someone away from my bench you would
get a tap on your shoulder 'Go away up to the Gatehouse'. And
by the time you got there they had phoned up the time keeper,
he used to stand and go like that, 'three days suspension' ...
You weren't allowed your tea break in the morning and you
used to have your piece in your food box- hide it under the
bench and if you were caught ... 'Up to the Gatehouse'. Two or
three days suspension depending on the mood. [89 ]

Another engineer recalled that in the 1930s security of employment
in the engineering industry had become so tenuous that: 'Men were
starting on Monday at eight o'clock and being dismissed at nine-thirty
as being of no use'. [90 ] Macho management also featured as foremen
and managers roamed around the shop floor raising machine speeds
at will. [91 ] Buttressing the discipline was the increasing use of payments
systems, such as Premium Bonus Rate (PBR), to break collective con-
trols on output by promoting individual incentives. Although of little
use to small jobbing engineering firms, who were interested in quality
rather than in the volume of output, PBR became the favoured
method of payment in the larger firms. By 1927 just over 63 per cent
of turners and 51 per cent of fitters were on piece rates; by 1941 this
had increased to nearly 70 per cent for fitters and 80 per cent for
turners. [92 ] The spread of PBR decisively broke the system of district
rates, which had been the 'cornerstone of the AEU's job control strat-
egy'.93 However, while it violated the principle of equality of reward
and status in favour of payment according to employer evaluation of
task worth and individual ability, PBR encouraged a system of con-
tinuous bargaining over piece rates. [94 ] But this did not strengthen the
power of the workers or their union as the negotiations over rates
were conducted on an individual basis and rarely involved group or
mass protest over grievances.
Thus, engineering workers, while experiencing a greater levelling

208

_Technological Change and the Skilled Worker_

process in terms of skill, found themselves emasculated by changes
in the labour process which rendered them incapable in times of
economic depression of registering meaningful protest against the
tightening of industrial discipline, technological change and new
payments systems.
The same could also be said of smaller trades. The failure of the
jute strike in 1923 provided employers with a free hand to proceed
with plans to rationalise and modernise the production processes.
Spinners were forced to work two as against one frame and high
speed spinning was further advanced in the 1930s.[95 ] Weaving was
subject to little change in the 1920s; however, in the following decade
weavers were subject to much higher levels of exploitation. In 1931
they were operating two 80-inch looms; two years later two three-
yard looms were being tolerated. [96 ] As the new machinery had to be
run continuously to obtain maximum returns on the investment a
three shift system was introduced. This involved a restructuring of the
labour force. Legislation preventing the use of women and juveniles
on night shift meant that there was an increase in the number of male
operatives and a corresponding reduction the amount of juvenile
labour employed as piecers and shifters. [97 ] By these methods there
was a 10 per cent increase in output achieved in the jute industry in
the 1930s by a much smaller workforce of 24 000 compared to
35 000 in 1930.98

Other trades less affected by technological change and deskilling,
nevertheless experienced more intensive working regimes. Motormen
engaged in the heavy goods traffic in the 1920s were expected to
drive continuously without a break for ten to twelve hours a day,
although it was not uncommon for them to spend up to nineteen to
twenty hours at work. In the passenger vehicle sector inter-company
competition was so fierce that drivers were forced to operate at
excessive speeds to capture passengers. [99 ] In spite of the passing of
the Road Traffic Act of 1930 which made it illegal to employ drivers
for more than eleven hours a day, or without a break for rest and
refreshment after five-and-a-half hours continuous driving, employers
in the road transport sector generally ignored this provision. [1]0° Thus,
motormen were exposed to excessive hours of work, something
which took a heavy toll on their ability to resist employer control of
working time.

Of the major industries to be crippled by the collapse in world
markets in the inter-war period, shipbuilding was the least able to
reorganise production on the basis of new technology and/or scientific

209

management techniques. The barriers to economies of scale, such as
cyclical instability, which existed in the nineteenth century continued
to limit the scope for standardised production systems; therefore,
reductions in costs in the 1920s were sought in the area of wages. [101 ]
Most of the investment went into improving the capacity of the yards
by increasing the size of berths and improving the layout of the plant.
The only technical improvement of any significance was the univer-
salisation of machine riveting. [102 ] However, this by no means meant
technological paralysis. An assault was made on the skills of the
platers and there were attempts to introduce welding on a much
more extensive scale. The 'piano', or multiple, punch was capable of
perforating steel plates without, as McKinlay notes, 'the labour
intensive method of shouldering plates into position', and by 1926
ten Clyde yards had installed one. [103 ] The piano punch also held out
the possibility of increasing the level of prefabrication in the ship-
building industry, since the plates could be assembled under cover; a
development which would almost certainly have increased the level
of direct supervision and the awarding of semi-skilled status to the
plater. Implicit in its introduction was also the destruction of the
gang system in plating as the new machine had less reliance on helpers
than the old labour intensive methods. However, few members of
the Clydeside Shipbuilders' Association (CSA) were prepared in an
atmosphere of intense international competition to challenge the
Boilermakers' union over these issues, and the piano punch was
appropriated as with other technology by the men. [104 ] The only men
to suffer were the helpers who saw their numbers decline and their
wages reduced. [105 ]
In spite of the ability of the boilermakers to appropriate new
technology in the 1920s, they were subject to encroachments into
traditional working practices and customs. 'Tossing the brick'- a
ritual which symbolised the independence of labour and was per-
formed on the day of restarting work after a holiday- involved on
the sound of the yard whistle throwing a brick in the air, and only if
it landed in a certain way would the men resume work; for the first
few days it rarely did. By 1922 the manager of John Brown's was
confidently claiming that the ceremonial of 'tossing the brick' was a
dead letter, pointing out that 'members of the ironworkers' union
started promptly to work instead of walking up to the Yard gates and
then going away in their customary senseless fashion' .[106 ] Therefore,
depression effectively undermined these symbols of worker indepen-
dence in the shipyards and their demise buttressed and enhanced
managerial authority.

210


-----

The 1930s saw a more important challenge to union control of the
production process in shipbuilding emerge. Simpler, more standardised
ships began to dominate world production; a development which made
prefabrication a much more feasible proposition. Prefabrication
called forth the skills of the welder, a prospect which threatened to
undermine the position of platers and riveters alike. A direct indica-
tion of this was given when in the early 1930s the SEF reclassified
the welding of plates to the ship frame as semi-skilled work. However,
a combination of craft resistance and the platers' control of pre-
existing welding work on the bulkhead, allowed the workers, as
Richard Price points out, to establish 'their claims to all welding' .[107 ]
The stranglehold the Boilermakers' Union had on the labour process
meant that welding failed to make significant progress on Clydeside
in spite of the general weakness of labour in the 1930s. By 1939
welders only accounted for 2.8 per cent of the total workforce on
the Clyde. [108 ]
In the allied trade of steelmaking the element of craft mystery
which went into the making of steel placed an impregnable fence
round the labour process. As one steel smelter put it: 'Management
couldn't take over a furnace. Only the first hand could do that job,
with an apprenticeship of twenty-five to thirty years'. [109 ] The know-
ledge of the process was possessed by the members of the craft
community, in particular the foremen, who kept the foundry 'Bible'.
The 'Bible' recorded all observations which had a bearing on the
final product, such as temperature, and this was handed to the next
senior hand on the retirement or death of the foreman. If the next
senior hand did not progress to leading hand, then, in the words of
an official of the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation, the union
'wanted tae no why'.tto
All this points to the fact that mass unemployment and the general
weakness of trade unions in the inter-war depression did not result in
universal domination of the labour process by employers, and neither
did it lead to sweeping technological change. Worker resistance con-
tinued to impede change in the workplace, but, arguably, employers
were more restricted in modernising plant and machinery by their
reliance on labour intensive production methods. It was only in those
trades amenable to technological change and increased supervision
that employers were able to assume the unrestricted right to manage
their enterprises as they saw fit. However, even here, as the engineering
industry shows, the sheer variety of the product market impeded the
march towards Taylorist goals of rationalisation and standardised
production. Deskilling and managerial control of the work process

211

were to remain distant, but, as yet, unrealised ambitions. However,
almost all workers experienced some loss of control over their labour,
and were subject to a more intense form of discipline and working
rhythm.
These changes in skill and work rhythms were in some ways related
to the shifting managerial strategies for maintaining control in the
workplace. As we saw in the last chapter those strategies developed
in the nineteenth century by management were coming under pres-
sure from changes in the social relations of the workplace and by the
increasing bureaucratisation of production systems. The inter-war
period intensified these pre-1914 trends in both areas of direct and
indirect control.
As one might expect the industries which experience the greatest
degree of organisational and technological change were also at the
frontier of shifting forms of labour control. In engineering the position
of the foreman came under serious threat during the First World War.
Temporary state ownership of munitions factories led to a narrowing
of differentials between skilled workers and foremen due to excessive
overtime working, as well as increasing the supervisory role of the
former as the number of dilutees increased. [111 ] The enhancement of
collective bargaining saw the number of state officials responsible for
welfare and personnel and production issues increase, which further
eroded the authority of the foreman. However, the most telling blow
to the authority of the foreman came in the removal of his discre-
tionary powers to organise labour and production on a day-to-day
basis. Firms under the Munitions Act found that, as Keith Burgess
says, 'all aspects of workplace organisation, including manning levels,
the choice of operatives ... and the more general "ordering of work"
were subject to state control' . [112 ] The engineering foreman was thus
transformed into a supervisor exercising a more restricted role relating
to discipline and training. The organisation of labour and production
lay with specialist categories of management. However, in spite of the
reduction in their privileges and power, foremen in the engineering
industry were increasingly drawn into the management camp and
away from their men and their institutions. Membership of the
Foremen's Mutual Benefit Society, established by the employers to
attract foremen away from the ASE, only boasted 6819 members in
1919. However, after the collapse of the immediate post-war boom
membership more than doubled to 13 500 in 1922, and increased to
16 500 by 1930. [113 ]

The shift in status of the foreman and his progressive institutional
distance from workers in the engineering industry was symptomatic

212


-----

of the increasing influence of Taylorite philosophy among the larger
employers. In the coal industry there was also an increase in the
number of supervisory or 'oncost' men to intensify work discipline.
This drew class lines even more acutely as the blurring between
ownership and authority which had existed in the nineteenth century
was removed, making it very clear to the workers the source of
their grievances and oppression. However, in other trades, such as
shipbuilding and clockwork, which were less amenable to direct
supervision, the traditional forms of direct control acted to diffuse
authority over a range of figures.
In shipbuilding the 'bastards in bowler hats', as the foremen were
described by the workers, continued to exercise a large degree of
discretionary power. They continued to perform all the routine tasks
of organising labour and production. During the depression years
their power was, as one shipbuilding worker put it, that 'of life and
death .... He could stop you putting bread on your table'. [114 ] In less
skilled trades, such as clockwork, the power of the foreman was
even greater. One Edinburgh dockworker said that during the 1930s
'there were some awfae bad foremen. They didnae treat you as
human beings. You were there for their convenience'. [115 ]

Of course, not all firms used direct methods of control associated
with foremanship. Internal subcontracting which, as we have seen,
placed the responsibility for hiring, disciplining and paying the
workers with key employees, was under threat before 1914 from the
increasing bureaucratisation of production. Thomas Bell, in his evi-
dence to the Board of Trade Committee on Shipping and Shipbuilding
in 1916, laid bare the disadvantages for management in the squad
system when he stated that:

In shipyards it was thought that by giving the work out to
squads you reduced the general charges and did the work more
economically, forgetting that these squads were a number of
men banded together who in time got worse and worse. By
having only squads like that you play into their hands .... If a
squad refused to do a job you were at your wits' end if you did
not give way to them. Even if you offered some sum, no other
squad in the shipyard would take their job up. You were in the
hands of the squads instead of having proper discipline. [116 ]

The internal subcontracting system, therefore, acted as a source of
worker autonomy and solidarity in the yards and made managerial
control problematic. [117 ] However, it was in the process of gradually

being reformed; but the initiative came from the men rather than the
bosses. The boilermakers were weary of the disputes with their
helpers over wages and after the war acceded to employers' demands
to pay them through the office. The more democratic spirit of the
post-First World War era also made it more morally offensive to
employ other workers in such an exploitative manner. One plater's
apprentice articulated the distaste he felt when asked by his foreman
to hire casual labourers, remarking that: 'It would have been an odd
sight ... a couple of kids casting a quizzical eye over the dilapidated
group of men old enough to to have fathered both of us and then
having decided, saying "You"'. [118 ] Thus a major impediment to work-
er solidarity in the shipyards was removed as the platers shed part of
their authority over their helpers. In the other centre of internal sub-
contracting - the coal industry - the demise of the independent col-
lier and the 'pillar and stoop' method of coal-getting brought an end
to the system in most pits. However, it survived in certain areas up
until the Second World War. The Lothian Coal Company used the
contracting system as a means of divide and rule, or as one miner put
it, as a 'means of puttin' the workin' man against the workin' man'. [119 ]
The other main strategy for manufacturing consent among the
workforce was paternalism. As we have seen, the system of pater-
nalism was breaking down due to the advancement of state provision
of welfare. State welfare schemes expanded enormously during the
inter-war years as the prolonged existence of unemployment on a
mass scale appeared to defy the logic of supply side economics; the
existence of low wages did not price workers back into work. Added
to this was the massive increase in public sector accommodation which
undermined to a large extent the employers' use of housing as a
means of social control. Paternalism was confined to a few outposts
of industrial capitalism in Scotland. Mungo MacKay, managing
director of the Lothian Coal Company, used the threat of eviction to
discipline the miners and to ensure that the process of reproduction
functioned in the interests of the employers. One miner, whose son
wished to take up an apprenticeship away from the pits, was told by
MacKay to 'Either bring him up, stand him on Monday, or hand in
the keys o' the house'. MacKay also fined those miners who failed to
keep their garden in good order. [120 ] Similarly, as Morris and Smyth
have shown, in the industrial village of Prinlaws in Fife 'everything
was provided by the firm. Not only the houses ... but [also] the
church hall ... and the water supply and street lighting' .[121 ] However,
even these strongholds of the paternalist system collapsed after the

_Technological Change and the Skilled Worker_

Second World War as nationalisation and the welfare state changed
the nature of social relationships in the workplace and society. Control
was increasingly to be had through the wage packet and the spread
of payments by results systems in this period was a reflection of this.
From this examination of the labour process in the inter-war
period it would appear that with certain reservations the social rela-
tions of production were increasingly resembling the Marxist idea of
class struggle. The locus of authority was far clearer than it had been
in the nineteenth century when it was dispersed over a number of
figures. Moreover, the distinctions between the skilled and unskilled
were disappearing if wage differentials are any guide. A greater
homogeneity was evident within labour and this in many ways
underscored the emergence of a more universal working-class cultural
experience through the greater commercialisation of leisure, the
growth of the media, and the large-scale expansion of state welfare
schemes. The question which emerges from these discussions is how
did this growing sense of class identity impact itself on trade unionism
and labour politics in the inter-war years?

##### TRADE UNIONISM IN A COLD CLIMATE, 1914-1945

Trade unionism in Scotland underwent several phases of develop-
ment in the period from the beginning of the First World War to the
outbreak of the Second World War. Firstly, there was the phase of
industrial militancy from roughly 1915 until the onset of depression
in 1920; secondly, there was the revival of militancy in the period
immediately prior to the General Strike; thirdly, there was the phase
of accommodationism following the defeat of the General Strike
and the onset of mass unemployment; and, finally, there was the
re-emergence of trade unionism in the late 1930s as a result of the
re-armament drive. Within these phases of change and development
the modern trade union movement in Scotland was created; its chief
characteristics being British, bureaucratic in organisation, and amen-
able to corporatist solutions to social and economic problems. The
underlying question which emerges from this is how did the principle
of 'cooperation', in the words of officials of the Boilermakers' Union
responding to the TUC report on the Mond/Turner talks of 1927,
replace 'class war' and 'Red Clydeside'? [122 ]
The period in Scottish labour history associated with 'Red
Clydeside' is perhaps the most debated and researched by historians
of modern Scotland. [123 ] There is, therefore, little that can be added to
the empirical knowledge amassed by historians concerning the events
on Clydeside during the war years; however, a brief resume is neces-
sary if the foregoing analysis is to make any sense. The industrial
unrest on the Clyde began in the shipyards and engineering work-
shops in early 1915 with a strike over wages. A much publicised
agreement prior to the war between the unions, employers and the
state to do nothing to undermine the war effort effectively shackled
the hands of the official trade union movement in representing the
grievances of the rank-and-file and as a result the leadership of the

strike fell to the local shop stewards. Many of them had attended
classes in Marxist economics run by the revolutionary anti-war
activist, John Maclean, and a large number were also members of
revolutionary organisations, such as the Socialist Labour Party (SLP).
Thus, the industrial unrest from the outset created the impression,
particularly in government circles, of a challenge to the state by polit-
ically motivated agitators. The success of the 'tuppence an hour'
strike in 1915 enhanced the reputation of the shop stewards with the
rank-and-file and this only served to strengthen the unease within
the state over Clydeside.
To protect the gains made in early 1915 and to provide for future
co-ordination of activity an unofficial Central Labour Withholding
Committee was set up. This proved to be a perceptive decision as in
the summer of 1915 the Munitions Act threatened the whole basis of
craft control of production. The Act was designed to boost production
of war materials; however, in achieving this it introduced dilution and
a form of industrial conscription in selected war related industries. A
system of 'leaving certificates' was included in the measures, which
shop steward and, later, Labour MP, David Kirkwood, branded a
'slave's clause' as workers could only leave their employment with
their employer's consent. [124 ]The other main source of discontent was
the introduction of semi- and unskilled labour on work which was
previously the preserve of skilled craftsmen. It was in the response to
these measure that the _ad hoc Withholding Committee became the_
more organised and permanent Clyde Workers' Committee (CWC) in
October of that year.
The CWC organised stoppages against the Munitions Act and
demanded that if dilution was to be introduced it was to be under
workers' control. Lloyd George, then Minister of Munitions, to
assuage the fears of the labour force on these issues addressed them
and the shop stewards of the CWC at a meeting in December 1915 in
Glasgow and was given a hostile reception, being referred to previ-
ously by _Forward_ as the 'best paid munitions worker in Britain' .[125 ]
Failure to pacify the workforce over dilution led the government to
decide on a series of measures designed to destroy the ewe and end
the industrial unrest. William Gallacher, the chairman of the CWC,
along with John Muir and Walter Bell, was arrested on charges of
sedition and the CWC journal - The Worker - was suppressed after
only four issues. This signalled a general crackdown on the activities
of the shop stewards and some, like Kirkwood, were arrested and
deported to Edinburgh. With the imprisonment and deportation of

217

the leading shop stewards, the ewe collapsed, although it revived in
the immediate aftermath of the war to lead a campaign for a forty
hour week in industry; a campaign which ended in the famous George
Square riot in Glasgow in 1919.
The question which arises from this brief narrative account of the
industrial unrest on elydeside during the war years is: Did the state,
by suppressing the shop stewards' movement, prevent a revolutionary
situation breaking out in Glasgow?
To answer this one must first of all appreciate the realities of
artisanal workplace culture. As James Hinton points out, in his study
of the shop stewards' movement on elydeside, skilled workers in
shipbuilding and engineering were noted for their craft conservatism
and sectionalism. In his view it was the defence of skill and wages
which motivated them in their struggles with the state, rather than
wider class considerations. [126 ] Their opposition to the Munitions Act
was precisely because it offended their notions of independence and
their right to sell their labour at the best possible price they could
obtain for it. As David Kirkwood put it:

The outstanding feature of the Munitions Act was that it denied
the men the right to sell their labour to the highest bidder. This
cut clean athwart the political economy of the hour, and to the
men of elydeside it appeared little short of slavery. I felt it like
that. I was happy in Beardmore's as a free man. I resented being
in Beardmore's as a slave. I was part of the Forge by inclination.
I would not be part of it by compulsion. [127 ]

The preservation of skill and independence was at the heart of the
engineers' struggle and because of this the revolutionary shop stewards
failed to link the struggles against the Munitions Act with the activ-
ities being pursued outside the yards and workshops by the likes of
John Maclean and James Maxton against the war. Indeed, Maclean,
in his famous 'I accuse' speech from the dock in May 1918, attacked
the leaders of the ewe for this very reason. [128 ] Those shop stewards
who were brought to trial apologised to the court and made it clear
that they had no desire or intention of hindering the war effort. At his
trial Gallacher insisted that he had 'no desire to impede production'
and a fellow worker was called to give evidence that both he and
Muir had opposed strikes. [129 ] Kirkwood also claimed that he was in
favour of dilution and for his efforts when his deportation order was
lifted in May 1917 he was made a foreman at Beardmore's Mile End

shell factory. As foreman Kirkwood, with Gallacher and Arthur
McManus under him, introduced a bonus scheme which doubled
production. As a reward Beardmore presented him with the 'best hat
in Glasgow' .[130 ]

Kirkwood's qualified support for the war and his unwillingness to
link the industrial struggle with the political struggle to bring a halt
to the hostilities was, perhaps, understandable given his membership
of the moderate ILP; however, even among the more revolutionary
elements within the CWC the war posed a real dilemma. To actively
oppose the war meant consciously accepting the risk that one's
country might be defeated. Since the CWC was never prepared to
take that risk, it was unable to utilise its industrial power to bring
Britain's participation in the war to an end. What politicised the
industrial disputes on the Clyde and created an image of red revolu-
tion was the fact that the state had assumed control of the munitions
industry. As a result, each strike was a political one. Each protest by
the workers brought them into conflict with the state; thus, even
straightforward economic demands for higher wages and better
working conditions became political issues. Workers began to realise
that bargaining with one's skill, as had been the situation before the
outbreak of war, was useless as it could only be represented collec-
tively. As the official trade union movement was circumscribed by
the wartime industrial truce from representing the interests of the
rank-and-file a space developed in the area of representation which
was filled by the revolutionary shop stewards. But the bargaining
remained concerned with traditional issues and, as we have seen,
there was a general failure to politicise the industrial struggle by the
shop stewards.
For these reasons John Foster has argued that the climax of
industrial unrest on Clydeside was not 1915 but at the end of the war.
The strikes of 1919 overshadowed those of 1915 as they included far
more workers and involved a greater loss of working days. Forty
thousand workers were on strike in January 1919 in the shipyards
and engineering works on the upper Clyde; and 36 000 miners were
out in Lanarkshire and Stirling, along with 10 000 iron moulders. [131 ]
Over one-and-a-quarter million working days were lost, and there
was strong support for the strike among demobilised soldiers, as well
as women and young people. m Glasgow was ringed by tanks as
striking workers clashed with police in the famous George Square
riot. It seemed as if the whole of the working-class community of the
west of Scotland had been mobilised in demand of the Forty Hour

219


-----

week; indeed, as Foster points out, 'no other place in Britain wit-
nessed industrial action of anything like the general strike proportion
seen in the west of Scotland in January 1919'. [133 ] Moreover, the
movement was led by shop stewards in the ewe and had the sup-
port of key elements of the Scottish labour movement, including the
STUC, GTC and the Glasgow District Committee of the AEU. [134 ]

However, in spite of evidence of greater industrial militancy, and
violent clashes with the authorities, Foster's attempt to paint Clydeside
revolutionary red is a little misleading and, at times, exaggerated.
Firstly, the moderate ILP played a more important role in the strike
than any of the other parties on the left. ILPer Patrick Dollan was
responsible for the publication of the strike news sheet - Strike
###### Bulletin- which was circulated among workers at meetings and
street corners. [135 ] Among those labour leaders charged with incitement
to riot after the clashes in George Square were David Kirkwood,
later found not guilty, and Emmanuel Shinwell of the ILP, sentenced
to five months imprisonment, and William Gallacher of the CWC and
the BSP, sentenced to three months. Secondly, the much vaunted
solidarity of the Forty Hours struggle was only paper thin. Hugh
Lyon, leader of the carters' union and chairman of the STUC, played
an opportunist role throughout the strike. As spokesperson of the
STUC at a meeting with the CWC on 18 January 1919 Lyon argued
for the forty hour week but opposed strike action. When the decision
to strike went against him, he contradicted his former position and
joined the strike committee, becoming responsible for drawing up the
strike manifesto. Yet on 27 January, three days after the strike had
began, Lyon led the carters back to work, having made separate and
secret negotiations with the transport employers for a forty-eight
hour week. [136 ] Finally, the strike was confined to the west of
Scotland and there is little evidence to suggest that it was respon-
sible for engendering more widespread discontents and solidarities
among workers in the rest of Britain. In the end the failure of the
1919 Forty Hours strike marginalised the shop stewards' movement
and brought to a close the phase of unofficial representation of
workers' interests. However, in the engineering industry the
wartime struggles confirmed the shop steward as an integral part of
the bargaining process and this was recognised by the employers and
unions alike. [137 ]
The re-establishment of control over their members by the official
trade union leadership saw a new phase of worker organisation open
up. The war and its aftermath witnessed a tremendous increase in the

220


-----

number of union members in Scotland. An STUC survey of 1924
showed that around a third, or 536 432 Scots out of a total population
of 1655 656 over the age of twelve, were members of a trade union,
of which 14.6 per cent were female. Corrected estimates, which use
the number of insured workers rather than age as the basis of calcu-
lation, however, place the figure somewhat higher at 41.1 per cent. [138 ]
Even accepting the corrected estimates union density in Scotland
remained below the UK figure, with eleven trade unionists in Scotland
for every 100 in the population compared to 12.6 for the UK. [139 ]
Moreover, in major cities such as Aberdeen union density at only 27
per cent was well below the Scottish national average. [140 ]These trade
unionists were organised in 227 unions which would appear at first
sight to suggest that the average Scottish union was small, but this is
misleading as the thirty-six largest unions accounted for four-fifths of
total membership.I [41 ]
The rise in union membership in Scotland was accompanied,
however, by a decline in the number of exclusively Scottish unions.
By 1924, 60 per cent of organised workers in Scotland were members
of British trade unions, and but for the fact that the autonomous
county mining unions were included in the figures for independent
Scottish organisations, the proportion organised in British unions
would have been overwhelming. [142 ] Iron moulders in Scotland joined
the National Union of Foundry Workers after the war; the Scottish
tailors joined the National Union of Tailor and Garment Workers in
1919; the Scottish Amalgamated Society of Steel and Iron Workers
joined the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation in 1921; the Scottish
plumbers and cabinetmakers amalgamated with English unions in
1919 and 1920 respectively; the Scottish dockers merged with the
TGWU in 1923- only to secede, however, in 1931; and the gas-
workers, municipal employees and National Union of Women
Workers joined the General and Municipal Workers Union (GMWU)
formed in 1924. By 1938 trade unionists organised in exclusive
Scottish unions were to be found mainly in textiles, some building
trades, such as painting and slating, printing, clockwork and baking,
although the bakers' union was affiliated to the TUC. [143 ]

The growing nationalisation of the labour movement inevitably
drew Scottish workers into national disputes. The industrial battles
surrounding the mining industry, the engineering lock-out, and other
large-scale industrial conflicts which characterised the period 1921-26
all involved Scottish trade unionists and promoted a greater sense of
class consciousness. The anti-English sentiments exhibited by Scottish

221

unions before the First World War, and which were articulated as late
as 1919 in the forty hours strike against 'the dictatorship of the
London juntas', [144 ] broke down as worker supported worker in Britain
in these epic struggles between labour and capital and the state. The
outcome, however, was generally unfavourable to labour.
The engineering lock out of 1922 over the vexed question of man-
agerial functions led to the near collapse of the AEU. The union's
financial reserves fell from £3.25m in 1920 to just over £35 000 and
it was forced to suspend all its benefits with the exception of sickness
and superannuation. [145 ] By 1923 over a quarter of the AEU's member-
ship in 1920 had been lost. In Scotland the loss was even greater as
numbers fell from 52 151 in 1920 to 25 030 in 1923, or by 52 per
cent, reaching an all time post-war low of 15126 in 1933. [146 ] The
abolition of the district rate and the introduction of PBR systems
undermined solidarity among engineers after the lock out and
increased the trend towards the 'individualisation of shopfloor bar-
gaining' .[147 ]Workshop organisation broke down as employers sacked
activists and the AEU executive dismantled lock out committees to
prevent them becoming a focus for rank-and-file discontent. From
between thirty to forty shop stewards under a full-time convener
operating in Beardmore's Parkhead Forge in 'normal times', the
number dropped to zero in 1923. The same was true of John Brown's
on Clydebank. [148 ] Such was the level of demoralisation within the
engineering workshops that the executive of the union complained in
1932 that for the last ten years the 'organisation had not functioned
as a Trade Union' .[149 ]
However, the victory of the employers forced the AEU to make the
transition from craft to industrial union. In October 1922 skilled
trades such as sheet metal working, pipe fitting, and pipe bending
were incorporated within the membership of the AEU. Four years
later the union opened its doors to all ranks of male, but not female,
engineering workers irrespective of skill. Indeed, the new industrial
unionism in engineering was organised around preventing the exten-
sion of female labour. As Kibblewhite has noted, in the 1930s, and in
spite of 'lethargy in the face of continuing dilution, as soon as the
threat was posed by women entering the trade, the workers on the
shop floor swung into action with remarkable speed'. Not surpris-
ingly on the eve of the Second World War, engineering unions were
still refusing to admit females into membership, which left the field
open to the TGWU and the National Union of General and Municipal
Workers to organise the bulk of the women. [150 ]

_Trade Unionism in a Cold Climate_

Similarly in the mining industry, the record of industrial success
was, on the whole, disappointing, in spite of the fact that Scotland
along with South Wales was the most strike-prone region in Britain,
being ten times more strike-prone than Lancashire and twenty times
more strike-prone than the Midlands. [151 ] There had been a radicalising
period during and immediately after the First World War while the
mines were under state ownership. Younger miners, and those with
Marxist sympathies were dissatisfied with the accommodationism of
the Lib/Lab old guard of miners' leaders such as William Adamson,
Labour MP and leader of the Fife county union; [152 ] they set up Reform
Committees, mainly in the large mechanised pits around Blantyre in
the west of Scotland, and Bowhill in Fife. Indeed, one-fifth of the
Lanarkshire union's branches became affiliated to the Committee and
campaigned against conscription and (successfully) for the removal
of the pro-war secretary of the county union. [153 ] The return of miners
from war in 1918 only intensified the general discontent with the
existing leadership and a protracted campaign led by left-wingers
such as David Proudfoot and Philip Hodge, for a more militant policy
and greater democracy within the mining unions was initiated. This
development effectively split the Fife miners and two rival unions
represented the men until reunification in 1927. In spite of this Fife
miners participated in the major disputes in the industry in 1921 and
1924. Defeat in the vicious 1921lock-out, which saw running battles
between miners and police, many acts of industrial sabotage and van-
dalism, such as burning haystacks intended as feed for pit ponies, led
to demoralisation and redundancies; membership of the Lanarkshire
county union fell from 50 000 to only 15 000. [154 ] Although within
three years the losses had been made good and the miners' unions,
boosted by the success in 1924 of 'Red Friday' saw a revival of mili-
tancy, which culminated in the 1926 General Strike, this does not
disguise the fact that even before the crucial conflict in 1926 the
miners were deeply divided. During the General Strike there 'were
even rival soup kitchens', and in spite of the fact that between 1921
and 1926 successive miners' conferences passed resolutions favouring
a national union, the county unions, particularly Ayrshire and the
Lothians, refused to give up their autonomy. [155 ] After the failure of
the 1926 dispute the NUSMW faced almost total collapse. Between
July 1925 and July 1929 only £40 140 had been received in dues,
levies and affiliation fees from the districts to the General Fund, and
membership nose-dived from 50 000 in 1926 to 25 000 one year
later. The NUSWM only survived by severely pruning back its

223

administration, running up arrears with the MFGB and ceasing to
affiliate to the STUC. [156 ] Moreover, younger militant miners were
'weeded out' and the age profile of the mining industry in Scotland
underwent a profound transformation. By the early 1930s one in five
miners was over fifty, whereas in 1921 a third were under twenty-
five and 60 per cent were under thirty-five. The changing age profile
of the labour force only increased the trend towards conciliation
with employers. [157 ]
However, it would be wrong to see the period running up to the
General Strike of 1926 simply as one of industrial conflict and mili-
tancy. There were other forces at work designed to extend corporatist
structures aimed at emasculating trade union militancy throughout
Britain. By 1920 most manual workers were covered by national
agreements regarding such matters as pay, hours of work and over-
time.158 As well as the establishment of national agreements, joint
councils were set up with employers, of which there were seventy-
three in 1921. There were also thirty-three trade boards established
in the years 1919-20 covering around 3 000 000 employees, mostly
female, in industries where wages were unregulated. [159 ]
This move in the direction of corporatism was intensified after the
defeat of the unions in the General Strike. The events surrounding this
moment of class struggle are too well-documented to need further
articulation, but the consequences for the state of industrial relations
in Scotland, and in Britain as a whole, are of vital importance. The
General Strike of May 1926 collapsed within nine days amid cries of
sell-out from the left and the rank-and-file. The idea of betrayal is,
however, somewhat misplaced. The union leadership believed in the
parliamentary road to social betterment and had no time for syndi-
calist strategies for capturing state power. Thus, once the state had
declared the strike as unconstitutional, and faced with the prospect
of class war or an honourable settlement, the General Council of the
TUC eagerly accepted the terms laid out in the Samuel Memorandum.
Thus, their actions came as no surprise, although the climbdown by
the TUC was interpreted as a humiliating defeat. The miners deserted
by the labour movement were left to shoulder the burden of conflict
on their own, which they did for eight months until starvation forced
them back to work on the employers' terms. In other industries
employers weeded out militants and effectively quietened resistance
in the workplace. The state taking revenge on the unions passed the
Trades Disputes Act of 1927, which forced civil servants into isolation
from the rest of the labour movement and forbade public authorities

224

_Trade Unionism in a Cold Climate_

from demanding union membership of employees. It also stipulated
criminal liabilities for strikers involved in attempts to 'coerce' the
government, restricted the right to picket and made union members
'contract in' to support the Labour Party. As late as 1939 more than
half the workers in unions affiliated to the STUC were outside the
Labour Party, having failed to 'contract in' .[160 ]

Notwithstanding these measures, the state tended to adopt a non-
interventionist policy towards industrial relations. As H. B. Betterton,
of the Ministry of Labour, put it to a delegation from the National
Union of Manufacturers on 12 October 1926 advocating reform of
labour laws, 'the one thing that is desirable is not to do anything
which would tend to bring in the State automatically into every trade
dispute'. [161 ] But it could be argued that the State had no need to inter-
vene as the unions and the employers reacted to the collapse of the
General Strike by adopting a more conciliatory attitude towards
each other.
The new mood was symbolised in the Mond/Turner talks of
1927/28 between the employers and the TUC. The idea of round-
table talks was initiated in 192 7 in a letter of invitation from Lord
Melchert (Mond) of ICI to the chairman of the TUC, Ben Turner.
The talks proposed to discuss the whole issue of industrial organisa-
tion and industrial relations, focusing specifically on such matters as
the management of industry, new developments in technology, and
the setting up of a National Industrial Council and conciliatory
machinery for settling disputes, as well as programmes of industrial
rationalisation. The first meeting took place on 12 January 1928 and
a further twelve followed.
The recommendations of the talks were endorsed overwhelmingly
by the TUC at its 60th Congress. [162 ] However, the initial response of
the STUC was one of opposition. A Woodworkers' resolution at the
1927 Congress condemned the 'propaganda of industrial peace con-
ducted by leading officials, whether individually or in cooperation
with leading employers' and called instead for the 'elimination of
capitalism'. It was carried with only one dissenting voice, although
the general secretary, William Elger, decided not to raise the question
of opposition at the British TUC later that year. [163 ] The employers
themselves adopted a more sanguine attitude and failed to commit
themselves to the proposals emanating from the talks.
As unemployment grew to alarmingly high levels following the
Wall Street crash in 1929, the movement towards a tripartite con-
sensus between labour, capital and the state became more irresistible.

225

Although Ernest Bevin of the TGWU had stated as late as 1928 at the
TUC that he 'would rather discuss unemployment with capitalists
than with government' the existence of millions out of work changed
the minds of even the most entrenched union leaders in a short space
of time. [164 ] By 1930 the STUC was calling on the state to introduce
permanent schemes of arbitration and conciliation, arguing that 'the
time was now past when the state should merely keep the ring and
allow powers to fight out their quarrels because industry was now
organised in such a fashion that the State was involved willy-nilly in
every large dispute'. [165 ] As the depression reached a climax in 1932
the problem of making, rather than controlling work became the
primary focus of trade union deliberations, and the demands on the
state increased. The STUC acknowledged the need for greater inter-
vention by the state and centralised planning of the economy to
regenerate Scottish industry. A list of demands was drawn up which
included: the relocation of industry to depressed areas; public works;
and the nationalisation of basic industries.
But state ownership did not mean workers' control of industry;
nor did the STUC envisage the unions having an input into economic
policy-making. Speaking as a member of the General Council,
C. N. Gallie made clear at the Scottish Labour Party's annual con-
ference in 1933 that the labour movement was opposed to attempts
to 'conscript wealth', and that they were not 'prepared to saddle
workers with responsibility'. He further asked: 'What side would
they take in a dispute? Who would they be accountable to? ... If
they went on to argue for workers' control they would cease to be
socialists and would become syndicalists' .[166 ] Nationalisation, there-
fore, was not the pathway to the socialist commonwealth but a
mechanism for improving the efficiency of industry in the interest of
the nation and making it more socially accountable. Moreover, further
nationalisation beyond the basic industries was only to be undertaken
if enterprises failed to meet the criteria of a 'well-distributed and
properly planned industry'; only then, as William Elger put it, would
the 'industry ... be reorganised on Socialist lines' .[167 ]A minimalist role
was also envisaged in the area of economic planning and research,
with the STUC calling on the Secretary of State for Scotland, Walter
Elliot, to set up a body for this purpose 'equipped by an expert staff'
and 'financed directly by Government' .[168 ]

Such moderation made it possible for Scottish labour to come to
an understanding with business leaders in the 1930s over issues of
mutual concern. Scottish businessmen were equally concerned at the

226

depressed condition of industry, and some of the more prominent
established quasi-official bodies aimed at creating a broad consensus
on the needs of the economy. The first of these initiatives was the
Scottish Development Council set up in 1931 under the chairman-
ship of shipbuilder Sir James Lithgow. But, as Michael Fry notes,
while Lithgow wished for voluntary state intervention in regenerat-
ing the Scottish economy, younger industrialists 'raised in decades of
stronger state apparatuses' pushed for the provision of state finance
and close 'involvement of the state in industry'. [169 ] By 1936 both
sides of industry had come to see planning as a 'bipartisan ideal'. [170 ]
This view was endorsed in the founding of the Scottish Economic
Committee (SEC) in that year, which had strong representation from
the STUC and the Co-operative movement, as well as local govern-
ment. In its evidence to the Barlow Commission on the industrial
location of the population, the SEC showed itself to be 'a strong
advocate of economic planning under an autonomous Scottish
body'. [171 ]
These developments in many ways presaged the construction of
political consensus in Britain in the decades after the Second World
War, but they also forced the leadership of the trade unions in
Scotland to redefine its relationship with the rest of Britain and its
own rank-and-file. The STUC and some individual unions had tra-
ditionally favoured the idea of Home Rule for Scotland. Indeed, it
was the STUC, because of its conscious separate identity from the
British TUC, which was the standard bearer of nationalist aspirations
within the Scottish labour movement. In 1919 it passed a resolution
calling for separate Scottish representation at the Paris Peace talks. [172 ]
However, the organisational amalgamations of the 1920s and the
increase in unemployment saw the STUC cool its stand on Home Rule.
When the question of 'the principle of Dominion Self-Government
for Scotland' was discussed at Congress in 1931 delegates affirmed
that they had no wish to 'cut the Scottish people off from England
or to erect a barrier between them' . [173 ] The solution to Scotland's
economic problems was to be achieved by the state in partnership
with labour and capital operating in a UK-wide context committed
to economic growth and physical planning of the economy.
The move towards adopting corporatist solutions to the economic
problems of Scotland also led to an ever widening space developing
between labour leaders and the left, particularly the Communists. As
early as 1924 the STUC at its Ayr Congress refused to read a letter
from the Communist front organisation, the National Unemployed

Workers' Movement (NUWM), regarding affiliation. By 1925 'there
was positive hostility to the NUWM in some quarters', and affiliation
was rejected by 116 votes to 36. Attempts to allow NUWM com-
mittees to affiliate to local trades councils were also defeated. [174 ] All
through the secretaryship of William Elger, the STUC remained
implacably 'opposed [to] working with the NUWM' even to the
point that in 1936 following the mass hunger march it rejected a
proposal to initiate a joint campaign with the latter. [175 ] One dissatisfied
delegate to the 1936 Congress attacked the attitude of Elger and the
General Council, claiming they were 'apparently prepared to recog-
nise Sir James Lithgow and Lord Elgin and go knocking at their doors
while refusing to associate with a genuine working class body, even to
the extent of receiving a delegation' .[176 ] But this kind of impassioned
class rhetoric went unheeded within the leadership and instead of
co-operating with the NUWM, the STUC established Unemployed
Associations (UAs) at the Hawick Congress in 1932 under the auspices
of the trades councils. The UAs were intended to campaign for jobs
and improved scales of relief, as well as to prevent blacklegging dis-
putes. However, by 1934 only four had been established, a further
nine councils had reported that they had been unsuccessful in their
attempts to form unemployed sections, and another twenty-three,
including Glasgow, Edinburgh, Paisley and Dundee, had ignored the
STUC instruction. [1]77
Another initiative to stimulate employment was overtime bans and
campaigns for shorter hours, and while they were successful in the
jute industry in Dundee in 1933, and also in the engineering trades
in Aberdeen, as Kibblewhite points out, 'in conditions of mass unem-
ployment in the 1930s overtime bans were unrealistic'. [178 ] Similarly,
the campaign conducted by the metal unions for shorter hours in
the early 1930s was a flop. A meeting held in Edinburgh in 1933 on
this issue only attracted sixty people. [179 ]The recognition by the rank-
and-file that a shorter working week could only be successful if there
was an increase in the hourly rate, something which the employers
would not accede to, acted to kill the campaign before it got started.
In opposing the NUWM, the STUC and individual unions could
not come up with anything appealing to the unemployed or anything
challenging to the orthodox line on unemployment. Indeed, given the
half-heartedness of the support of the unions for the unemployed, one
cannot but conclude that the employment initiatives emanating from
the STUC were more concerned with protecting the living standards
and the working conditions of those in work from competition from
those on dole.

228

Hostility was also expressed towards the parent of the NUWM,
the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB). Shortly after the TUC
ruled in 1928 that no person associated with the Communist front
organisation, the Minority Movement, would be eligible to attend
the annual conferences of trades councils, James Doonan, of the
executive of the National Union of Scottish Mine Workers
(NUSMW), said of the CPGB that 'Their policies and methods were
alien to the traditions and desires of the British workers' .[180 ] This was
the signal to begin removing Communists from official positions
within individual unions. The Scottish Carters, the Jute and Flax
Workers, the Boilermakers, the Engineers and the GTC, which had
been an affiliated organisation in 1925, all initiated procedures to
exclude from office members of the Communist Party and its affili-
ated organisations. [181 ] The resolution of the Carters stating that 'no
communists or members of the Minority Movement can be eligible
to hold any official position in, or be part of any delegation acting for
the SHMA', was typical of those unions proscribing Communists. [182 ]
In response, the Communist Party set up rival unions, but the only
one to enjoy a measure of success was the United Mineworkers of
Scotland (UMS).

With the support of the large, highly mechanised pits in Fife and
Lanarkshire, the UMS exploited the mineworkers' dissatisfaction
with the reformist leaders of the county unions and the deteriorating
working conditions. A number of the leading members, like first
president William Allan, had been active in the earlier Reform
Committees and as such from its launch in 1929 the UMS had some
credibility with the miners. None the less the UMS never recruited
more than 4000 members and by 1932 this had fallen to 2000, 65
per cent of which were located in Fife. The organisation eventually
disbanded in 1935 when its existence became an embarrassment to
a party trying to build a united front with other labour organisations
against fascism and unemployment. Success was in any case always
problematical, not simply because of the geographical marginalisation
the UMS, but also, as Alan Campbell points out, the UMS support was
based on pits with a history of militancy and a high level of Catholic
Irish workers. Protestant Larkhall was a weak area of communist
support, whereas Catholic Blantyre and Craigneuk remained districts
where support ran high for the CPGB. [183 ] Unemployment and defeat
in 1926 saw strike levels fall and Catholic miners were always wary
of offending the local parish priest. Abe Moffat recalled that during
a strike in the Shotts coalfield in 1930 a decision to hold a demon-
stration against the fact that the miners were receiving no relief from

229


-----

public authorities was thought impossible as it would pass the priest's
house and 'if he happened to be in the garden, the Catholics would
fall out from the demonstration'. [184 ] However, in spite of these
handicaps to growth, reunification in 1935 did little to improve the
relations between the miners' leaders and the CPGB and they con-
tinued to be bitter. A resolution in July 1938 proposing to send a
Scottish miners' delegation to the USSR for the occasion of the 21st
anniversary of the Republic was defeated 4-11. [1]85
The winding up of the UMS once more reunited the mining unions
in Scotland and they, like unions in other industries, began to expe-
rience growth as the rearmament drive of the late 1930s began to put
Scots back to work. The AEU saw membership in Scotland grow
from 15126 in 1933 to 34476 and rising in 1938, and this was
reflected in the increase in the number of engineering shop stewards.
During 1937, the Glasgow division of the AEU alone gained nearly
150 shop stewards, and by June 1938 it was estimated that more than
this number were attending stewards' quarterly meetings. [186 ] The
NUSMW also recovered some ground and affiliated membership
stood at 30 000 in 1935, although the largest increases were experi-
enced in the general industrial unions of the unskilled, such as the
GMWU and the TGWU which saw membership grow in large part
through amalgamations from 16 830 in 1932 to 42 806 in 1939 and
from 26 000 to 56 983 respectively in the same period. [187 ] The state,
perhaps mirroring the growth of corporatist sentiments, was also
responsible for the increase in union membership. The Road Haulage
Act of 1938 forced union recognition on employers and obliged
them to accept collective bargaining and agreements, which saw
membership of the SHMA increase from 7596 in 1932 to 10 500 in
1939. [188 ] The Agricultural Wages (Regulations) Scotland Act of 1937
did much the same in the previously disorganised agricultural
industry. [189 ]
By the outbreak of war in September 1939, the labour movement
in Scotland had recaptured much of the ground ceded to employers
during the inter-war depression. However, the depression years had
witnessed a sea change in the outlook of the unions towards important
issues such as Home Rule, industrial relations and the economy. The
defeat of the General Strike in 1926 had proved crucial as syndicalism
became a dead letter and a new spirit of conciliation with capital
began to emerge and deepen as the economic situation worsened.
The acceptance of an all-British solution to mass unemployment saw

230


-----

_Trade Unionism in a Cold Climate_

Home Rule become the politics of the 'parish pump' as far as Scottish
trade unionists were concerned. [190 ]The move towards a nascent form
of corporatism was irreversible and this involved detaching the
extreme left from positions of power within the labour movement.
The final _coup de grace_ came in 1939 in the 'Memorandum on the
Role of Trades Councils' which in combating the influence of the
CPGB and promoting greater centralisation destroyed the old Trades
and Labour Councils and divorced the industrial and political wings
of the labour movement.
In spite of these changes the Scottish labour movement remained
deeply patriarchal. Although female trade union membership had
grown during the inter-war years, craft unions still refused entry to
women. Moreover, the workplace concerns of women workers
remained marginalised within the labour movement despite the fact
that the STUC set up a Womens' Advisory Committee in 1927. Thus,
while the momentous changes occurring in the industrial wing of the
labour movement would have important knock-on effects for labour
politics in this period, amounting to a virtual remaking of the Labour
Party in Scotland, the peripheralisation of women in the trade unions
also ensured that their concerns remained neglected in the political
struggles of the 1920s and 1930s.

###### Chapter 24

##### THE REMAKING OF THE
 POLITICAL CULTURE OF THE SCOTTISH WORKING CLASS,

#### 1914-1945

Almost reproducing the experience of the industrial wing of the
labour movement, Labour in inter-war Scotland underwent signifi-
cant changes in ethos and ideology which resulted in the destruction
of its links with popular Liberalism and the evangelical socialism from
which the party had evolved. Keir Hardie had defined socialism as 'a
People's cause' and 'when it is won it will be their fight which has
won it' .[191 ] The role of Labour in this cause was principally, in the
words of Willie Stewart, Hardie's biographer, 'To inspire the people
with ... faith ... in themselves'. [192 ] However, after 1918 Labour
moved in a relatively short period of time from being a party which
strongly identified with Hardie's unshakeable belief in the ability of
the people to act as the agent of social and economic transformation,
to one which relied on the bureaucrat and the planner to change
society through the construction of a strong technocratic British
state. The key turning point in this process was the departure of the
ILP in 1932, but there had already been signs prior to this that the
political traditions of the early Labour Party were failing to resonate
with the concerns of workers faced with continuing levels of high
unemployment after 1920 and newer generations of Labour activists,
radicalised in the turbulent years of the First World War.
Indeed, the war years proved to be a watershed for the political
fortunes of Labour in Scotland as not only did they sow the seeds of
Liberal decline, but they also forced the party in opposition to far left
organisations to define its political position on important ideological
issues such as gradualism versus revolution, direct action versus the
parliamentary road to socialism, and so on. These doctrinal questions

232

_Remaking of the Political Culture of the Scottish Working Class_

were never resolved at an intellectual level, as few on the Scottish
left, outside of John Maclean, were given to political theorising;
instead they owed their resolution to lessons learned in day-to-day
struggles over socio-economic issues, in conflict with the state, and
in debates with political opponents.
All these issues were pushed to the forefront of Scottish politics
during the First World War and its immediate aftermath. As we have
seen the west of Scotland became the focus of industrial conflict;
however, it was also the scene of anti-war protest and rent strikes.
Much has been written about this dimension of 'Red Clydeside' and
to reconstruct the political narrative of this phenomenon, or to engage
in the various acrimonious historical debates over whether these
years represented a missed revolutionary opportunity, would serve
little useful purpose. What is important to the analysis offered in this
chapter is not the chronicalling of the events which constitute 'Red
Clydeside', but interpreting their outcomes for the development of
Labour in Scotland, particularly as they affected the party in the

1920s, from where the political narrative begins.
The industrial struggles on Clydeside led engineering and ship-
building workers to appreciate the ambiguities of their relationship
with the capitalist state; similarly the rent strikes in Glasgow which
led to the passing of the Rent Restrictions Act of 1915 also showed
working-class women the possibilities within a democratised state
for social reform. As R. J. Morris points out, in his article on 'Red
Clydeside', the passing of the 1915 Act and the subsequent housing
legislation which followed the end of the war smashed the free
market in urban housing rents. [193 ] Those activists opposing the war,
although a small minority even within the labour movement in
Scotland in the initial phase of hostilities, not only experienced the
oppressive side of the state through incarceration in His Majesty's
prisons on charges of sedition, but also developed a critique of the
role of the state in running the war effort on the home front. Few were
instinctive pacifists like Keir Hardie; what motivated their opposition
to the war was the inequality of sacrifice demanded of the working
class. Socialists argued that the war was being used as an occasion
for arms manufacturers to make obscene profits, while at the same
time the state allowed employers to press down on workers' wages,
housing factors to evict war widows from their homes, and in its own
right introduce a socially unfair system of military conscription. Tom
Johnston, editor of Forward, caught the essence of socialist protest
in his pamphlet - The Huns during Three _Years_ _of the Great War_

233


-----

###### (1918)- in which the 'Huns' were war profiteers. The demand of the
anti-war movement, therefore, was not the unilateral declaration of
peace by Britain, but the conscription of all social groups and
resources: a socialised war effort underpinned by a socialised economy.
As working-class casualties mounted the left opposition began to
receive widespread popular support. By 1917 it was claimed that:
'The strength of hostility to militarism in Scotland may be gathered
from the fact that the War Party is a discredited minority in nearly
all the Trades and Labour Councils north of the Tweed'. [194 ] Even
the moderate Scottish Wholesale Co-operative Society gave support
to Patrick Dollan and Emanuel Shinwell in their refusal to do military
service and generally opposed conscription. [195 ] However, in spite of
growing opposition to the war and the success of the February Revo-
lution in Russia, few members of the anti-war movement articulated
a strategy aimed at politicising the war in the direction of overturning
the existing social order. Only John Maclean of the BSP and those
grouped around him saw the war in this light, but crucially, although
popular with the Glasgow working class, Maclean failed to create a
mass movement. [196 ] While there was talk of establishing soviets to
the extent that even moderate ILPers, such as Ramsay MacDonald,
spoke in favour of the idea at the Leeds Convention in June 1917,
few on the British left understood the significance of the role soviets
played in Russian politics and fewer still had any idea how to link
them with existing working-class organisations. As John Wheatley
perceptively remarked, 'Everyone pointed to the Russian road, but
none was ready to lead the way'. [197 ] The ILP's brief flirtation with
Bolshevism was finally ended in 1921 when the Scottish ILP confer-
ence voted by 93 votes to 57 to reverse support for the Third
International. Motions favouring 'Soviet' style workers' control and
direct action, moreover, received only a handful of votes. [198 ]
The war years confirmed the ILP as the genuine expression of
working-class political aspirations; an achievement which was the
result of the party understanding more clearly than any of its left-wing
rivals the possibilities and limitations of working-class political mobil-
isation at this time. It was thus able to translate these insights into
policies which accurately reflected the alternative political economy
of the workers on Clydeside and elsewhere in Scotland. They were
summed up in the party's May Day Manifesto of 1918 which called
for a 'living wage for all', the abolition of the food profiteer and
'justice for our soldiers and their dependants' .[199 ] Political insight led
to gains in membership and support which saw the ILP increase its

234


-----

_Remaking of the Political Culture of the Scottish Working Class_

membership during the war years by 300 per cent and the number of
branches by 50 per cent. By September 1918 Scotland was the largest
ILP region with nearly 9000 members. [200 ] After the disappointment
of the 1918 general election, which was fought out on a restricted
franchise in extremely jingoistic circumstances, the ILP also enjoyed
spectacular electoral success in 1920 when it won 45 seats on the
Glasgow Town Council and two years later when it sensationally
won ten out of city's fifteen parliamentary divisions.
The electoral breakthrough in 1922 emphasised the shift to the
left which had taken place within the Scottish working class. The
formerly divisive issues of gender, ethnicity and religion were laid
aside as both Catholics and Protestants, men and women, voted
overwhelmingly for Labour. Women were especially inclined to vote
Labour and Forward noted that 'women's meetings were marked by
a religious fervour for social reform and justice'. [201 ] The women had
put down the Rent Restrictions Act of 1915 to Labour's efforts and
had rewarded the party, particularly so when a judgement of the
House of Lords in a test case sponsored by Labour forced landlords
to reimburse tenants for past paid rent. Labour activists in Aberdeen
in the 1922 general election shouted at workers entering polling
stations to 'Vote for [Frank] Rose [Labour] and you'll get your rent
money back'. [202 ]
Similarly, the Catholic Observer advised its readers to vote Labour
as it had proved most sympathetic of all the political parties to pro-
viding resources out of local taxation for separate Catholic schooling
within the state system. The Catholic press, however, had little choice
but to urge its readers to opt for Labour as the partitioning of Ireland
in 1921 removed the question of Home Rule from the political
agenda until the 1960s. After 1921 the Liberals had little to offer the
Irish Catholics, and, rather than see them move in the direction of
the atheistic CPGB, the Catholic hierarchy advised its flock to vote
Labour as the lesser of the two evils. Tensions did emerge between
the Catholic Church and Labour, particularly over the Spanish Civil
War, but on the whole, the Catholic community proved loyal and
enthusiastic supporters of the party. [203 ]

From 1922 Labour became the main political party in Scotland,
peaking in 1929 with 43.5 per cent of the total votes cast in the
general election. However, if looked at from the perspective of urban
Scotland, Labour's dominance was all the more pronounced. From
the 1918 general election in which Labour polled 34.9 per cent of the
votes cast in the three largest industrial cities - that is, Aberdeen,

235


-----

Dundee and Glasgow - the party commanded a majority of votes in
1929 with 53.8 per cent of the poll. The position of Labour in the
burghs of east and west Scotland, which included Edinburgh and
Leith, Kirkaldy, Paisley and Hamilton, was equally dominant, rising
from 26.7 per cent in 1918 to 48.7 per cent in 1929. [204 ] Class identity,
as witnessed in the rising support for Labour in the 1920s, had it
seemed become more important and manifest in voting choices than
identities grouped around allegiances and feelings associated with
ethnicity and religion. This was, in large part, the result of the wider,
homogenising social and economic forces mentioned above, but it
was also due to the improvements in Labour's electoral organisation.
However, Labour's electoral popularity masked growing discord
within over the role of the leadership and the political direction of
the party, particularly when in government. The 'Red Clydesiders'
from their arrival at Westminster in 1922 showed themselves to be
impatient with the slow pace of parliamentary reform and the need to
rely on other parties to push legislation through the Commons. They
were men in a hurry; the poverty of their constituents meant that
they could not be anything else. Political impatience with established
institutions gave the Clydesiders the image of being wild men;
however, the evidence points to another interpretation, one which
emphasises the conventionality and social conservatism of their
world view. It would also point to their remoteness from the Scottish
working class. Indeed, the class alliances that made up the Scottish
ILP operated around traditional values of the radical political tradi-
tion: teetotalism, pacifism, Home Rule and a Christian socialist
morality. They were the twentieth century's embodiment of the spirit
of the Covenanters, and often referred to themselves as such. As John
Paton put it: 'All of them could and did claim to be "rebels" against
evil social conditions and the inequalities and injustices of
Capitalism, but of not one of them could it be said in any literal sense
that he was a "revolutionary"'. Indeed, socialism was to most 'a
remote ideal of little practical importance'; what really mattered were
policies to ameliorate poverty such as 'an increase in old age pensions
and other small-change proposals'. As one commentator put it: 'These
Glasgow men have put at the base of their hard practical minds
the two dogmas: "Everyone must work", "A sufficiency for every
worker"'. [205 ] Few, if any, of the Clydesiders accepted Marx's materi-
alist conception of history, even those like Neil Maclean, William
Leonard and James Maxton, who had acted as tutors in John
Maclean's Marxist economics classes. People were more spirit to
them than the product of changing material circumstances. Most

236


-----

of the Clydesiders 'studied the works of Robert Burns, and not a
few ... found their inspiration in the Bible'; a view supported by
Patrick Dollan, who claimed that John Wheatley used to coach young
agitators in his home 'in collectivist policy and propaganda always
based on the teaching of the early Christian fathers'. [206 ]

There was little, then, in the ideological baggage or educational
background of the Clydesiders that set them apart from other members
of the Labour Party; indeed, as said above, in many ways they could
be described as socially conservative. What distanced them from the
MacDonald was their determination to resolve the issue of mass
poverty. However, the MacDonald leadership placed a greater prior-
ity on making Labour part of the mainstream of the British political
system than resolving the problem of poverty. In practice this meant
conciliating the middle classes and pursuing a moderate programme
of social reform. To the Clydesiders this policy was incomprehensible
as they tended to view parliament as 'territory occupied by the class
enemy'. [207 ] MacDonald's stress on the primacy of representational
politics over other forms of political or industrial protest also alien-
ated the left-wing MPs and the rank-and-file in the Scottish ILP. To
the Clydesiders the war on behalf of the poor was to be fought on
all fronts and include all sections of the labour movement, including
communists. James Maxton, MP for Bridgeton, Glasgow, was con-
vinced that 'capitalism could be brought to its knees by a well-
organised standstill ... in a few weeks'. [208 ]

Not all in the ILP shared Maxton's views. A powerful group with-
in the party which included Emmanuel Shinwell, Tom Johnston and
Patrick Dollan emerged emotionally and politically attached to
MacDonald and his political practice and ideology. This axis showed
its colours during the short-lived Labour government of 1923-24,
which had increasingly drawn criticism from even warm supporters.
Dollan defended MacDonald from his critics in the pages of
_Forward,_ claiming that 'No man has worked harder for any cause
than MacDonald has worked for the Socialism of the ILP'. [209] Dollan,
underlining the primacy of politics, also attacked the idea of using
extra-parliamentary forms of protest as vehicles for social change,
arguing that the 'walls of Capitalism are more likely to collapse as a
result of the patient sapping and organised efforts of the ILP'. [210 ] As
the CPGB, since its formation in 1920, was the foremost proponent
of direct action Dollan opposed its affiliation to the Labour Party
and was instrumental in pulling the Scottish ILP and the GTC round
to this view. [211 ]
The growing chasm between these political tendencies widened

237


-----

even more in the aftermath of the General Strike of 1926. As far as
MacDonald and his supporters in the Labour Party were concerned
the failure of the Strike marked the triumph of parliamentarianism
over direct action. From then on it was to be parliament, and not the
industrial struggle or street protest, which was to be the motive force
in bringing about economic and social justice. Ramsay MacDonald
summed up the new political direction of Labour when he declared
that 'the weapon of the General Strike is no good - even less now
than ever'. [212 ] However, the triumphalism of MacDonald's declaration
was in stark contrast to the interpretation of the left, who saw the
defeat as marking not the end of mass working-class action, but
rather its beginning. Maxton, for example, saw defeat and the series
of repressive state actions which followed it, including the Trades
Disputes Act of 1927, as creating conditions which 'made revolution
inevitable'.[213 ] While trade union leaders launched the Mond/Turner
talks, the left in the Scottish ILP along with miners' leader A. J. Cook
responded by issuing the Cook/Maxton Manifesto of 1928, calling for
the working-class to engage in an unceasing war against capitalism
and collaboration.
The publication of the Manifesto ended any pretence of unity
within the ILP in Scotland and the rest of the country. The experience
of the Labour government of 1929-31 put the seal upon it. As far as
Maxton and his supporters within the ILP were concerned, staying
in the Labour Party meant 'creating in the public mind the idea that
the capitalist system in all its essentials must be preserved at all
costs'. [214 ] This view was endorsed at the local level. The annual meet-
ing of the Glasgow ILP Federation in April 1932 expressed dissatis-
faction at the 'slow progress being made to achieve "municipal
socialism"' and accused Labour conveners of council committees of
becoming 'so much engrossed with the technicalities and business-
side of committees that they had forgotten their main objective on
the Town Council, which was, Socialism'. [215 ] The only option was
disaffiliation. After several heated internal debates in 1932 the ILP
by a clear majority opted for a clean break from the Labour Party.
This led to political suicide for the ILP as its membership and influ-
ence dwindled in the 1930s. However, its departure was felt in other
ways within the labour movement; indeed, it could be argued that
until very recently disaffiliation was the singular most important
event in the history of Labour, particularly so in the case of Scotland.
Disaffiliation did not simply mean a loss of members and the
establishment of a rival political organisation; it also involved the

238


-----

virtual remaking of the Labour Party in Scotland in terms of its
organisation, ethos and ideology. For until that historic event the ILP
was in many ways the Labour Party in Scotland. In the 1929 general
election, out of 68 Labour Party candidates all but one were members
of the ILP, thirty of them directly sponsored. According to the 1928
Labour Party conference, three-quarters of party speakers were ILP
activists.[216 ] The ILP was also responsible for propaganda, which if
the _Times_ report of 1922 is anything to go by was prodigious, with
'152 meetings held in Glasgow' alone in one week in August.[217 ] The
reporter was also 'struck' by the sheer volume of cultural activity
underpinning the more overt political work of the ILP. There were:

Socialist study circles, Socialist economic classes, Socialist musical
festivals, Socialist athletic competitions, Socialist choirs, Socialist
dramatic societies, Socialist plays ... Socialist Sunday schools ...

[and] Socialist newspapers. [218 ]

The list was by no means exhausted as there existed a great many
more cultural and social associations and organisations connected
with the labour movement in some way or another. [219 ]
The influence of the ILP was also enhanced by the lack of interest
shown by trade unions in the Labour Party in Scotland in the 1920s.
Few unions paid more than a nominal affiliation fee to the Scottish
party; indeed, only the TGWU, the miners, the National Union of
Distributive and Allied Workers, and the railwaymen and railway
clerks paid more than one pound in affiliation fees. Many trade
union branches failed to affiliate to the local constituency parties.
The mining unions were the most active of industrial organisations
in the Scottish Labour Party, and in some ways constituted a 'party
within a party', employing five full-time political agents in 1921. In
places where there were no party branches, but where there was a
union branch, the miners' branch 'functioned as the local Labour
party'.[220 ] However, the late 1920s saw the membership of the
NUSMW decline because of recession and the split between the old
unions and new reform movements; a phenomenon which only
further strengthened the political influence of the ILP within the
Scottish labour movement. Indeed, Dollan claimed that he did 'some
"ghosting" for those [miners' officials] who were shy about writing
drafts for orations or making researches for economic and historical
facts'. [221 ]
Although many of the pro-affiliationists, such as Dollan and

239


-----

Johnston, went on to form the SSP in 1932 to maintain the ideals
and the cultural life of the ILP within the Labour Party, this did little
to improve the organisational structure of the latter. Indeed, by setting
up a parallel organisation, it only led to duplication of effort. As
Arthur Woodburn made clear on his appointment as secretary of
the Scottish Labour Party in 1932: 'There was practically no Labour
Party in Scotland. The Labour Party was still a federated body and
the real drive was in the ILP ... my job was practically to build from
sera tch'. [222 ]
The political task was, then, awesome, particularly as Labour had
been reduced to just three parliamentary seats in Scotland in the 1931
general election. Moreover, in the nerve centre of Labour in Scotland

      - Glasgow - the party was at its weakest. Most of the Glasgow ILP

branches, including Shettleston, Govanhill, Hutchestown, had
favoured disaffiliation and their departure meant whole constituency
Labour parties ( CLPs) lost their organisational structure. In the
Bridgeton and Hutchestown district parties all the officials resigned
because of their support for the ILP. [223 ] According to _Forward,_ the
biggest Labour Party branches were now in West Lothian, Aberdeen,
Dundee and West Edinburgh;[224 ] all places which had strongly been
in favour of affiliation. [225 ] The cutting edge of Labour policies was
now being sharpened in places with a history of political modera-
tion, rather than in Glasgow with its radical and Marxist traditions.
The building of the new Scottish Labour Party was largely the
work of Woodburn and Elger, of the STUC, but also Labour coun-
cillors for Glasgow's Ruchill ward. Both were from lower middle-
class backgrounds and were members of the National Union of Clerks,
as well as officials of the Scottish Labour College - Woodburn as
secretary and Elger as treasurer. These links, according to the former,
created a close working and 'harmonious relationship' between the
two men. [226 ] As to political questions they both favoured an essen-
tially bureaucratic, non-ideological approach. As such they acquired
expert knowledge of party procedure, and were committed as much
by temperament as anything else to centralisation and tight party
discipline. Elger had in his time as secretary of the STUC sought to
reduce the powers of the trade councils, considering them undemo-
cratic, and increase the influence of the General Council within the
Scottish labour movement. [227 ] With the assistance of charasmatic
figures like Patrick Dollan, Woodburn and Elger were able to trans-
form Labour from a radical, almost messianic party of idealists into
a social democratic organisation run on mechanistic lines; a process

240


-----

_Remaking of the Political Culture of the Scottish Working Class_

which, although successful, at least after the electoral debacle of
19 31, in enabling Labour to win votes, led to disillusion among
party activists.
The process of building of the Labour Party in Scotland in the
1930s involved, as far as the leadership was concerned, the eradication
of anti-centralising tendencies within the constituencies, parties and
branches. Branch discipline did constitute a major headache for the
centralisers within the party. As the unit of organisation was the
Trades and Labour Council, communist infiltration was a constant
problem, as was the participation of Labour members in demonstra-
tions organised by or with the NUWM. Once the CPGB abandoned
its 'social fascist' campaign in 1935 the call for a United Front against
fascism and unemployment appealed to a number of activists, whose
participation led to their expulsion. Those expelled included leading
party activists: Arthur Brady, secretary of the SSP, was expelled for
taking the chair with Harry Pollitt of the CPGB at a United Front
meeting. Members of the Dundee Trades and Labour Council were
also expelled for acting with communists; and Edinburgh was warned
that it would be disaffiliated if it co-operated with the United Front. [228 ]
The issue of party discipline was resolved in two ways: firstly, by
Woodburn issuing a summary of the party constitution for the
acceptance of all candidates for local councils and parliament, which
created, he admitted, a 'furore' and led to fruitless appeals to the
National Executive Committee (NEC) of the Labour Party, although
'they could hardly object to my enforcing the conditions of the
constitution';[229 ] and secondly, when in May 1938 the Scottish Labour
Party conference decided by a vote of 51 to 31 to separate Trades
and Labour Councils from the local party organisation. The decision
was overwhelmingly reaffirmed by the STUC later that year,[230 ] and,
in practice, meant that union delegates from outside the Labour
Party would no longer vote in the selection of Labour candidates,
which was now the sole province of the constituency parties.
The crushing of internal debate and freedom of action was but-
tressed by changes in the composition of the NEC of the Labour
Party falling in the electoral debacle of 19 31. The dominant trade
union leaders of the 1930s used the weakness of the parliamentary
party to extend their influence within Labour in key areas of policy-
making. The fact that half the Labour MPs were sponsored by the
Miners' Federation made the task somewhat easy. [231 ] The consequence
of this was to strengthen the tendency towards even greater manage-
rial centralism within the party. From 1931 the NEC consciously

241


-----

used Labour's regional organisation to police constituency politics.
The Scottish executive was thus left with little discretion in policy or
organisational matters. Its subordinate role was graphically illustrated
by the NEC's high-handed appointment of Woodburn as secretary
without even considering nominations proposed by the Scottish
leadership, and by its imposition of former National Liberal candi-
date for Bethnal Green in 1922 and Liberal MP for South Hackney
1924-29, G. M. Garro-Janes, as Aberdeen North candidate in
1935.[232 ] But the fragmented Scottish Executive, with its eighteen
members drawn from the unions, constituency parties, and socialist
societies, lacked the cohesion to challenge its subordination effec-
tively. Its powers were so severely reduced that Woodburn claimed
that SECLP was only 'a piece of internal machinery providing the
movement with advice on Scottish affairs, and the movement in
Scotland with a coordinating authority to review, advise and coop-
erate [sic] the membership and organisation'. [233 ]
Nationally emasculated by an increasingly powerful NEC, itself
subject to greater trade union control, Labour in Scotland found its
declining independence had important ramifications for the values
and principles upon which it had been founded and which had done
much to shape its development. This was in line with the changes
taking place across a wide spectrum of Scottish opinion which, as
we have seen, emphasised the collaboration of labour and capital
and assigned a higher priority to state intervention and planning in
economic and social affairs than to the older radical idea of popular
control of work. Initially, this involved a reassessment of Labour's
attitude towards the state, but it was also to have significant conse-
quences for its traditional championship of Home Rule for Scotland.
The absence of an industrial policy was a noted weakness of
Labour in the late nineteenth century as it failed to politicise the links
between workplace and the political system. Much of this was the
result of Labour's belief in the infinite productive powers of capitalism
and in the historical and moral inevitability of socialism. As Woodburn
put it 'Economically, Socialism is the child of Capitalism .... [it] is
the logical outcome of the economic tendencies of Capitalism .... I
believe Socialism to be inevitable'. [234 ] Capitalism, it was believed, had
solved the problem of production in that it had created the possibility
of achieving and abundance of wealth. However, it had failed to solve
the problem of distribution because it had created a selfish society
based on profit rather than need, disfigured by many people 'starving
in the midst of plenty', as John Wheatley put it. [235 ] To remedy the

242


-----

situation all socialists had to do was to gradually take over the means
of production and distribute the wealth of the nation on a more equi-
table and rational basis. Such evolutionary views, espoused earlier by
MacDonald, not only minimised the role of human agency in bringing
about social change,[236 ] but also were naively based on the ability of
capitalism to engender continuous economic growth, something which
proved impossible during the inter-war depression. In these circum-
stances, the problem of distribution became secondary to the problem
of production, to which Labour had given little thought.
The paralysis of Labour thought on how to stimulate growth in
the economy and put the unemployed back to work, saw the political
leadership drawn, like the industrial wing of the labour movement,
towards the idea of consensus solutions. This had already been
envisaged by Tom Johnston as early as 1926, when he called for un-
employment to be treated as an issue standing above party politics. [237 ]
As Under-Secretary of State for Scotland in the second minority
Labour government, Johnston held 'weekly conferences of MPs from
all parties to discuss Scottish issues' ,[238 ] and a few years later he was
a signatory to the manifesto of the Liberty and Democratic League
(later the Next Five Years Group). The League was non-partisan and
included men of diverse background and opinion, such as Julian
Huxley, Lord Rutherford, Harold MacMillan, and Hugh Dalton;
significantly it advocated physical planning as the primary means of
economic regeneration. Johnston was clearly of the opinion that only
through consensus could the Scottish economy be regenerated and
he counselled his colleagues in the labour movement to enlist the
'goodwill' of 'industrialists and agriculturalists' in this endeavour. [239 ]
This plea by Johnston was echoed a few years later by Dollan in an
address to the Glasgow Junior Chambers of Commerce in which he
stated that he found 'young capitalists more sympathetic and under-
standing to Collectivism than their fathers and grandfathers', and
called upon socialists to modernise their thinking in similar ways. [240 ]
Commitment to planning the economy was further boosted by the
experience of the Soviet Union, whose rates of economic growth
appeared to defy western economic trends in the 1930s. This only
enhanced optimism among the Labour leadership about the possi-
bilities of economic and social planning. As Woodburn said of his
visit to the Soviet Union in the early 1930s, 'here is a land of hope' .[241 ]
This type of uncritical admiration of the Soviet Union grew in
strength during the Second World War to the extent that Christopher
Harvie could claim that 'Russia's resistance and planning gripped the

243


-----

imagination of the left in Britain'. [242 ] The overall effect, however, was
to make planning acceptable not only on the left but also to 'middle
opinion'.
Support for a strong centralised state meant an end to Labour's
commitment to Home Rule for Scotland and an acceptance of the
permanency of the Union. Previously, the demand for Home Rule by
Scottish Labour was expressed in language which bordered on racism.
George Buchanan, ILP MP for Glasgow, argued in introducing his
private members' bill to the Commons in May 1924 that Scottish
nationalism was derived from the fact that:

Our historical and cultural traditions are different; our racial
characteristics are different. The Celt has long memories, the
Englishman forgets quickly. There are members on these
Benches ... who fight their electoral battles upon, say, the battle
of the Boyne .... We have members of these Benches who fight
them on the battle of Bannockburn .... We can never obliterate
these national characteristics. [243 ]

However, from the late 1920s, and especially with the founding of
the National Party of Scotland in 1928 by old ILP stalwart Roland
Muirhead, and the onset of severe depression in the early 1930s,
commitment to Home Rule began to waver. The changing outlook
of Tom Johnston and James Maxton on this the question of home
rule is instructive as they represented the two wings of the movement.
During the 1920s Johnston had supported George Buchanan's
Government of Scotland Bill in 1924 and James Barr's Bill of 1927,
which demanded dominion status for Scotland and the removal of
Scottish MPs from Westminster. However, his stance on Home Rule
underwent a significant revision by the mid-1930s and he became
simply an advocate of administrative devolution. While serving on the
1936-37 Gilmour Commission on Scottish administration Johnston
only went so far as to support the rationalisation of Scottish depart-
ments. By the time he took office as Secretary of State for Scotland
in the Churchill coalition in 1941, his Home Rule programme con-
sisted of no more than 'increased administrative autonomy, the
segregation of Scottish business in parliament and the development
of ad hoc executive and consultative bodies'. [244 ] From a more left-wing
perspective, Maxton had by the mid-1930s come to associate nation-
alism with fascism and to argue that the real struggle for the labour
movement was between capitalism and socialism, rather than between

244


-----

competing models of social democracy. In this apocalyptic struggle
there was no role for Home Rule as the 'time had gone past for purely
Nationalist struggles. A struggle for National independence and
against Imperialism can only be justified if it combines with it a
struggle for the overthrow of capitalism as well'. [245 ] From both left
and right, Labour had come to the conclusion that self-government
offered no solutions to the economic problems facing Scotland.
Speaking for the official wing of the party, Arthur Woodburn
argued: 'The mere separation of Governments gives no power under
capitalism to prevent industry growing in England instead of
Scotland ... National Socialist planning of Britain would, by coor-
dinating industrial production and social need'. [246 ] Home Rule was
thus abandoned in favour of administrative devolution of economic
and industrial powers. This led to a new relationship between Scottish
Labour and the British state based on the understanding, as Michael
Keating and David Bleiman point out, 'that Scottish interests were best
promoted by a strong UK government'. [247 ] By 1937 self-government
as a political issue was moribund. Labour's immediate programme
contained no mention of it. When some die-hard Home Rule Labour
MPs complained, Hugh Dalton, speaking for the NEC, told them
that it was not 'an urgent reform' as the party 'in its first parliament'
would be 'too busy ... bringing the Socialist Commonwealth into
existence to spare time to give Home Rule to Scotland'. [248 ]
The decline of Home Rule sentiment among Labour leaders in
Scotland was part of a wider assault on the cultural traditions of the
movement itself. Idealism, the hallmark of the old ILP, was being
kept alive in the party by SSP activists; however, it soon came into
conflict with Labour's evolving commitment to consensual politics.
Repeated clashes were experienced over issues relating to fascism and
war. The SSP had inherited the pacifism of the ILP, as its first chair-
person, Patrick Dollan, made clear in 1935 when he declared it to be
an 'anti-war party'. There would be, he claimed, '1000 conscientious
objectors in Scotland for every score in 1914'. [249 ] However, as war
broke out in Spain, and later threatened to engulf the whole of
Europe, a rift developed within the SSP and soured its relationship
with the Labour Party. As Labour procrastinated over the issue of
intervention in Spain, the SSP called for an end to the British embargo
on the supply of arms and munitions to the Spanish government.
While DoHan and other leading members of the Labour Party and
STUC General Council were endorsing civil defence and air raid
precautions, as well as supporting Chamberlain's National Voluntary

245


-----

Service Scheme, the SSP was condemning such actions as 'a betrayal
of the working class'. 2so

By 1939, however, the SSP had all but collapsed. At its conference
that April it was admitted that 'diminution in membership in recent
years ... is plain', and that there was 'a great deal of apathy within
the SSP itself'; and although responsible for about 25 Glasgow town
councillors, 'no more than three or four came near the conference'. [251 ]
The pacifist position of the SSP alienated leading Labour figures.
Woodburn, who had been a conscientious objector during the First
World War, argued that pacifism was leading Hitler to believe that
the 'morale of our people is giving way'. [252 ]
Labour's abandonment of pacifism took place in the context of
the struggle between democracy and fascism, as did its rejection of its
republican past. As far as the leadership was concerned, the defence
of democracy necessitated not only the building of a cross-class
alliance, but also involved the rarification of monarchy as bulwark
against right-wing extremism. As James Middleton, secretary of the
British Labour Party, put it at the Scottish conference in May 1935:
'people were making comparisons between our own nation and the
nations who were suffering abroad and were thanking God for a
constitutional monarchy'. [253 ] Writing on the death of George V in
January 1936, Patrick Dollan underscored Middleton's views, when
he attacked the ILP 'republicans', claiming that 'the workers have
made more progress in Great Britain in the last 25 years than in any
other country', which proved to him 'that the constitutional monarchy
doesn't interfere with the progress of Democracy'. [254 ] Later that year
the Labour-controlled Glasgow Town Council organised celebrations
for the Coronation of the new king, Edward VIII; interestingly as it
turns out a crypto-fascist!
The idealism of the ILP which had manifested itself in the moral
conduct of its members and in its encouragement of healthy pursuits
for young workers as the living embodiment of the potential of
socialist society, also experienced decline in commitment. The Socialist
Art Circle, part of the labour movement in Scotland's attempt to
create a counter-culture to the commercialised world of capitalist
entertainment, collapsed amid general apathy in the 1930s.[255 ] The
same was also true of support within the labour movement for
Socialist musical festivals. A correspondent in _Forward_ remarked
that at the recent concert of the William Morris Choir there was
'only a half-hearted turn out of Socialist Glasgow'. [256 ]
The relevance of temperance to socialism also became unclear.

246


-----

_Remaking of the Political Culture of the Scottish Working Class_

Although the British Labour Party had ceased to debate the subject
of temperance from the 1921 conference, the ILP throughout the
1920s kept up a fight against what it considered the growing menace
of the drinks trade. Forward criticised the Daily Herald for failing to
'register its first fearless condemnation of the drink evil', and argued
that Labour's policy of municipal control was 'an easy expedient of
weakening the opposition to the drinks trade ... the problem is not
_ownership of an evil,_ but the best method of abolition'. [257 ] As late as
1929 a number of Labour magistrates in Glasgow who voted in
favour of granting drinks licences to certain publicans were instructed
by the Glasgow Trades and Labour Council (GTLC) to resign from
the town council Labour group and banned from attending its meet-
ings.258 However, the departure of the ILP in 1932 saw temperance
become increasingly irrelevant to Labour's social values. Patrick
Dollan, a former fierce opponent of the drinks trade who had at the
1923 ILP Conference described alcohol as an 'insidious poison',
abandoned teetotalism in favour of an environmentalist position on
alcohol abuse, saying:

Give people a healthy environment, decent employment and a
regular income, and they will practice a form of self-government
which will demonstrate how capable and worthy they are of a
higher order of society than capitalism ... an upwards standard
of life is more helpful for temperance than preaching or exhor-
tation .... The [Labour] Party is not committed to prohibition
any more than it favours intemperance. It believes in public
ownership and control of the Liquor Trade.[259 ]

The abandonment of the values of the older political tradition from
which Labour had emerged was part of the process of remaking the
party; that is, transforming it from a morally eclectic, idealistic and
almost millenarian organisation into a bland, professional, electoral
machine, capable of winning votes but incapable of infusing its
members with the kind of emotional zeal to confront the evils of
capitalism possessed by the old ILP. In many ways these changes
were overdue; the older Labour tradition had its weaknesses, not
the least being elitism and social puritanism which alienated it
from many members of the working class. ILP organiser, John Paton,
remembered that as a young party member he 'glowed with right-
eousness', and acquired like other ILPers the 'air of men set apart'.[260 ]
Robert Selkirk, miner, said that the 'puritanical and moralistic

247


-----

temperance advocacy of Scottish miners' leaders ... antagonised min-
ers and other workers'.[261 ] The decline of moral sentiment within the
political wing of the Scottish labour movement allowed the party to
represent a larger constituency of working-class people than simply
the respectable. It allowed, in the words of Eleanor Stewart, Labour
candidate for Edinburgh North in the 1929 general election, the party
to reach the 'poorer districts', not just those inhabited by 'artisans,
civil servants and the lower middle class' .[262 ] But in widening the social
bases of party support a price was paid in respect of membership and
political vision.
The building of a mass party capable of mobilising working-class
aspirations on a variety of levels beyond simple parliamentarianism
was ditched in favour of electoral mobilisation. As activism declined
it impacted itself on membership. After an initial increase in 1932,
membership began to decline in the late 1930s, falling from 29 510 in
1935 to 29159 in 1939, making Scotland the smallest regional Labour
Party in Britain.[263 ] Moreover, Labour's vision of the 'new social order'
amounted to little more than a meritocracy 'in which the children of
workers', according to A. B. Clarke, miners' leader and Labour MP
for North Midlothian, 'will have equal opportunity with the children
of the wealthy'. [264 ] As Christopher Smout put it: 'Labour in Scotland
became synonymous with the defence of council housing, jobs in
heavy industry and sectarian schools: it had nothing whatsoever to
do with participatory democracy, enthusiasm for socialism or hope
for the future' .[265 ] In a period in which class identity was becoming
more pronounced Labour proved itself incapable of articulating an
alternative political economy to the capitalist cycle of boom and
bust, or providing a credible challenge to entrenched power and
wealth in Scotland and the rest of the UK. Failure in these spheres
made Scottish Labour defer to a much greater extent than previously
to 'middle class ideologies', [266 ] and to rely on the bureaucrat and
planner rather than the people as agents of social and economic
change. The outbreak of war in 1939 accelerated this process as
Labour and the unions became integrated into the wartime version
of the corporate state.

 INTERPRETATIONS

The 1930s represented a transitional period in the history of the
labour movement in Scotland. The remnants of the older radical
tradition and the values associated with popular Liberalism were
discarded as Labour remade itself as a statist, technocratic party,
seeking cross-class support for the planned economy. This process
reached its apotheosis in the Attlee government with its policy of
large-scale nationalisation of major industries and utilities and the
establishment of the welfare state offering 'cradle to grave' coverage.
The widespread approval these measures received from all social
classes created the basis of a settlement between labour and capital
which lasted into the 1950s and 1960s. The long economic boom of
these years provided the basis for full employment and a more gen-
erous system of welfare provision which satisfied the labour move-
ment and, at the same time, rising profits appeased capital. However,
gradually the economy began to falter under the weight of foreign
competition and rising inflation. With the spectacular hike in the price
of oil in 1973, anti-inflationary politics revolved round the successful
implementation of incomes policies. But as they were only really
applied with any vigour in the public sector, incomes policies created
a perceived sense of unfairness among state employees. A groundswell
of opposition emerged in the state's backyard which ultimately led to
the breakdown of consensus politics.
Industrial warfare reached a crescendo in 1978-79 in the so-called
'winter of discontent'. The level of industrial strife in this period
combined with lengthening dole queues created the conditions for an
electoral breakthrough by the Tories in 1979 under the leadership of
Margaret Thatcher. Her electoral success began an unbroken sequence
of eighteen years of Tory rule and heralded the end of the craft culture
which had dominated the Scottish labour movement since the begin-
ning of the nineteenth century. The rolling back of the frontiers of the

251


-----

state, the ending of state subsidies to ailing firms, the large-scale pro-
gramme of privatisation, and the judicial attacks on the trade unions
knocked away the economic and legal supports of the predominantly
masculine culture of time-served men. The blight of manufacturing
and primary industries in these years also led to the break up of the
close-knit working communities which had provided bedrock support
for Labour and the unions. The social policies of the Tories encour-
aged a greater sense of individualism as more people were given help
to own their homes and a market system was introduced in almost
all branches of the welfare services. Within the social and political
milieu created by the Tories a 'new labour' ethos emerged, committed
to the politics of consumption rather than production. Its constituency
was formed from a new coalition of workers, both male and female,
in the professions and service sector. These work groups had different
aspirations and expectations from those workers in heavy industry
whose experiences had generated past solidarities in working-class
communities. The year of 1979, then, marked the beginning of the
end for the male, skilled industrial, Protestant worker in Scotland
and represented a climacteric in the political development of working-
class politics north of the border.
These changes in the economic structure and in the nature of
political discourse and practice were, of course, not confined simply
to Scotland; they were part of a British-wide, one might argue global,
process of economic transformation and political realignment. In this
respect Scotland's experience appears no different to that of other
parts of Britain and the rest of the advanced economies. However,
there is a regional dimension to consider in this cross-national
restructuring process. The diverse characteristics of Scotland's eco-
nomic and social development produced a different configuration of
political behaviour. Economically, Scotland has experienced a more
thorough dismantling of manufacturing industry and at a greater
speed than other comparable regions. At the same time, it has been
the recipient of a greater volume of inward investment from overseas
firms, particularly American, than any other part of the UK; a process
which has led to most manufacturing output being controlled by
companies based outside Scotland.
Socially, the profound rupture of past social relationships and
lifestyles has resulted in Scots workers enduring higher rates of
unemployment, and experiencing more privation and ill-health than
their English counterparts. Given the numbers receiving some form
of welfare benefit and living in public sector housing, the reliance on

252


-----

_Interpretations_

the state as a provider of resources is much more pronounced in
Scotland. The decline of the economy and the emigration of large
numbers of young and talented people has created a more skewed
social structure, with proportionately more working-class voters
than middle class, than is the case south of the border. Politically, the
reliance on heavy industry and the prominence this gave to skilled
workers and their interests meant that, while for most of the post-war
period England has been decidedly Tory, with even trade unionists
voting in overwhelming numbers for Thatcher in 1983, Scotland has
since 1959 consistently voted Labour. However, what is interesting is
that the decline of the skilled man's culture has not led to a shift in
political allegiances throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Scotland stub-
bornly refused to converge with voting behaviour south of the border
and continued to vote Labour in increasing numbers. By 1997 there
were no Conservative-controlled district councils or MPs. In Fife as
late as 1995 the CPGB had two councillors, while the Conservatives
had none. Scotland is now a Tory-free zone. What challenge there is
to Labour's hegemony north of the border comes from a resurgent
radical nationalism; a phenomenon which threatens to lead to the
break-up of the British unitary state.
In the light of Scottish peculiarities, a deeper investigation into the
changing nature of the economy, the social life, the workplace and
industrial relations is necessary before we can understand why polit-
ical loyalties have been maintained in spite of the changing nature of
the economy and society since 1945. However, it will also be impor-
tant to look at how the Scottish labour movement itself has changed
in terms of ethos and ideology if we are to understand the process of
remaking which has gone on in the movement in recent years.

##### 'FROM SHIPS TO CHIPS': ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CHANGE IN SCOTLAND, 1945-1990s

The outbreak of war in September 1939 provided a lifeline for the
badly ailing Scottish economy. War meant ships, munitions, uniforms,
fuel and energy, all the things that industry in Scotland was adept at
producing. The restocking boom which followed the end of war in
1945 and the Korean War in the early 1950s sustained industrial
growth. Employment in shipbuilding stood at 27 000 in 1951, the
same as it had been in 1900, and Scottish yards were producing an
impressive 12 per cent of world output between 1951 and 1954.
Similarly, the railway engineering industry in Scotland remained a
world force in the production of locomotives. [1 ] It all seemed a far cry
from the depressed 1930s. War production had allowed Scotland a
brief economic honeymoon of full employment and rising living
standards. However, reality soon set in and the economic trends
observable in the inter-war period reasserted themselves with even
greater ferocity in the decades after 1945.
From around 1960 there was a general attrition of Scottish manu-
facturing; then, in the 1980s, a holocaust. Between 1960 and 1975,
10 000 men a year were losing work in the productive sector and this
rate nearly doubled in the period 1979-87. Rather surprisingly, with
the exception of Strathclyde, Grampian region lost more jobs in the
decade 1971-81 than any other region in Scotland. [2 ] Skilled occupa-
tions were particularly badly affected with 80 000 jobs lost in the
decade 1961-71 alone; a loss larger than that in the previous fifty
years. [3 ] By the mid-1980s the new electrical and electronic industries
were employing more than double the numbers employed in steel,
coal and shipbuilding in Scotland. [4 ] Although each industry had its
own particular story of collapse and closure, some factors were

254

_Economic and Social Change in Scotland_

common to all. Foreign competition, low productivity and high
transport costs saw a decline in orders and jobs as Scottish industry
lost out to more competitive firms both in England and abroad.
Looking at the pattern of deindustrialisation in a more specific
manner, the most spectacular decline was witnessed in the former
most important industries in Scotland - coal and shipbuilding. The
coal industry was already in trouble by the end of the 1940s. In spite
of the general depression in the coal trade in the inter-war period, the
output of Scottish coal mines averaged 30m tons; however, in the
years 1948-52 this had fallen to 23-24m. The average output of
Scottish collieries in 1950 was 120 000 tons; the lowest for any division
of the National Coal Board (NCB). [5 ] From that date the industry's
fortunes continued to decline and by 1981-82 output had fallen to
7.1m tons and employment only stood at 20 000, whereas in 1939 it
had been 90 000. [6 ] By the end of the 1980s the Association of University
Teachers could boast having more members than the National Union
of Mineworker (NUM) in Scotland. Falling productivity and higher
extraction costs, combined with the general switch from coal to other
domestic energy supplies, saw the Scottish coal industry collapse,
until today there is only one working mine.
Similarly, shipbuilding experienced a catastrophic decline. The shift
from warships and cargo ships to oil tankers in the post-1950 era
found Scottish yards ill-equipped to compete with the emerging pro-
ducers in the Far East. Shipyard berths were too small and narrow to
cope with these monster ships and the technology used in Scotland
was too weakly developed to establish the type of flow line methods
of construction involved in building oil tankers.? As a result contrac-
tion set in; yards closed and jobs were lost. The workforce in
shipbuilding and marine engineering declined from 77 070 in 1950,
to 41 000 in 1978, reaching a distinct low of 14 000 in 1991. [8 ]
The decline of shipbuilding was particularly devastating for the
economy of the west of Scotland, as along with metals and engi-
neering, it accounted for around 57 per cent of total employment
compared to 42 per cent for the UK as a whole. As much of its mate-
rials were purchased within Scotland other industries soon felt the
cold draught of its decline. Steel was an obvious casualty since most
of its production was destined for local markets. Indeed, 20 per cent
of output in 1950 was earmarked for Clydeside shipbuilding. From
producing 20 per cent of British output in 1907, the share of Scottish
steel fell to only 12 per cent in 1960; then total collapse set in in the
1990s. [9 ]

255


-----

Other industries also faced massive decline. Unable to hold on to
its traditional exports markets and powerless to stem the flood of
cheap imports from the Far East, the textile industry in Scotland con-
tracted at an alarming rate. In 1950 it had employed 165 000 work-
ers in Scotland, but lost 109 700 jobs in the next 28 years, with the
bulk of them being jettisoned between 1960 and 1978. [10 ] More craft-
based industries also followed suit. The number of firms in the
Aberdeen granite industry fell from 51 in 1935 to 32 in 1960; the
number continued falling, until the industry completely collapsed in
the 1980s. Having always been a dirty and unhealthy industry, the
rise of the service sector saw few boys wish to enter an apprentice-
ship in the granite industry. The crisis in the supply of labour brought
the industry to the point of collapse. [11 ] The white fishing fleet at
Aberdeen also suffered as a result of a general failure to invest in new
trawlers and port facilities; in consequence the size of the fleet
declined from 161 boats in 1958 to just 25 in 1980. [12 ]
As primary and manufacturing industry began to slide there was a
general shift of the economy towards services and light engineering.
Services, of course, had always been an important part of the econ-
omy, but in the decades after 1945 they assumed an even greater role.
In 1936 services accounted for 32 per cent of output, but by 1958
they reached 49 per cent, and by 1984 they accounted for 60 per cent
of Scotland's gross domestic product and employed some two-thirds
of the total labour force. [13 ] Even in traditional industrial cities services
became the major employer of labour. In 1981, 72.8 per cent of the
Glasgow and 69.6 per cent of the Dundee workforces were employed
in the service sector compared to 80 per cent in Edinburgh and 74.2
per cent in Aberdeen. [14 ] Seventy years previously Glasgow had 48 per
cent of its occupied population engaged in manufacturing, Dundee
had 67 per cent, while Aberdeen had 36 per cent and Edinburgh 32
per cent. [15 ] This restructuring process reached a peak in the 1970s
and 1980s as heavy industry after industry collapsed, considerably
weakening Scotland's industrial base. Indeed, in the year September
1979 to September 1980, 61 000 jobs were lost in manufacturing
industries in Scotland, the worst hit being textiles, engineering and
metal manufacturing. [16 ]

One consequence of deindustrialisation has been the rise in foreign-
owned firms and the decline of the indigenous family-owned firms,
so long a feature of Scottish industry. By 1973, 59 per cent of Scottish
manufacturing workers were employed by companies based outside
Scotland. In that year a quarter of these companies were American-
owned; by 1984 US-controlled plants accounted for 68 per cent of

256

employment in foreign-based firms in ScotlandY Although the plants
established by American and other nationals are little better than low
level assembly production units, they have produced a revolution in
the labour market by reversing hiring policies based on gender and
religion. The electrical and electronics industries have increasingly
turned to female labour. By 1971 women workers in these industries
accounted for between 42 and 50 per cent of the total workforce. [18 ]
Indeed, the structural changes taking place in the economy has led
to a significant growth in the numbers of working women, especially
married women. The trend towards earlier marriage and smaller
families, alongside the increasing ownership of labour saving domestic
appliances, meant that married women found it easier to cope with
the demands of work and family; thus, they faced less impediments to
entering the labour market in large numbers and soon outnumbered
single females. The introduction of the contraceptive pill in 1964
allowed women to plan their reproductive cycle and this further
increased the incentive to find work. By 1971 it was estimated that
56 per cent of women between the ages of 20 and 29 in Aberdeen
were on the pill. [19 ] This changed the marital structure of the female
labour market. In 1911 married women accounted for only 5.3 per
cent of females in waged employment in Scotland; however, seventy
years later there was a complete reversal with single women only
accounting for 30 per cent of the total and married women 62 per
cent, the rest being either widowed or divorced. [20 ]

Overall, the percentage share of the labour market designated
female has increased from 39.1 per cent in 1976 to 48 per cent in
1992.[21 ] However, much of this share is located in part-time work
(under thirty hours a week) in the service sector. From accounting for
only 5 per cent of total female employment in 1951, the numbers in
part-time work grew to over 40 per cent and rising in the decade
1981-1991; only 7 per cent of males were in part-time work at the
later date. [22 ] In spite of the oil boom, three-quarters of jobs created
for married women in Aberdeen in the decade 1971-81 were of a
part-time nature. [23 ] At the level of occupation, over 40 per cent of
female shop assistants and 80 per cent of cleaners were part-time in
1981.[24 ] This employment trend has not only had a major impact on
the working-class household, it has also significantly altered the dis-
tribution of female employment. At the beginning of the twentieth
century women were employed in three major sectors: agriculture,
domestic service, and textiles and clothing. By 1981 over 75 per cent
of females were employed in the service sector, particularly in local
government, teaching, nursing and shopwork. Most clerical work

257


-----

has become the domain of women as between 1961 and 1981 male
clerical labour declined by 20 per cent to 60 000, while females
increased by 50 per cent to 181 000. Between 1951 and 1981 there
has been a doubling of the number of female nurses and teachers in
Scotland. [25 ]
The growth of female employment and the dominance in the econ-
omy of the service sector did not compensate for manufacturing
decline. The service industries proved incapable of absorbing all the
surplus labour. As a result Scotland's out-migration rate remained
exceptionally high in the decades after the end of the Second World
War. According to Slaven, three-quarters of the natural increase in
the population of the west of Scotland in the decade 1951-61left the
region. Consequently, there was only a modest growth in the eco-
nomically active portion of the population from 1 053 000 in 1951
to 1 071 000 in 1961.[26 ] The Toothill Report on the Scottish Economy
(1961) pointed to the fact that in 1801 the population of Scotland
was 18 per cent that of England and Wales; however, in 1961 it had
fallen to only 11 per centP Many of those who left were among the
most productive and talented workers and managers; indeed, the
vast majority of emigrants were in the age group 15-44, with the age
cohort 15-29 accounting for 68 per cent of outmigrants in 1986-87;[28 ]
a phenomenon which further compounded the problems of the
economy. As the potentially higher earning groups left Scotland in
droves for more congenial and better paid work elsewhere, incomes
declined which had a knock-on effect on the level of demand in the
economy.
Despite an improvement in earnings in the 1960s, by 1970 GDP
per head in Scotland was just over 90 per cent of the UK level; sev-
enteen years later, and, in spite of the oil boom, per capita GDP had
only improved marginally to 92 per cent of the UK average. [29 ] Not
surprisingly, Scots male workers earned around 96 per cent of the UK
average in the 1980s.[30 ] However, there were within Scotland existing
regional inequalities. Wage rates in Aberdeen in the early 1960s were
90 per cent that of Edinburgh and Glasgow and significantly below
that of Dundee, although this has been reversed in the last decade or
so. [31 ] By the early 1980s Scotland was estimated to be 'the worst
region in Britain for its disproportionate share of all low paid workers',
with 16.4 per cent of manual and 8.1 per cent of non-manual men
and 60.7 per cent of all women paid less than £85 per week. [32 ] As in
the 1960s, more low paid workers were to be found in Strathclyde
than in any other region of Scotland, although high rates of low paid

258

males were to be found in Tayside and Dumfries and Galloway. [33 ] But
for extensive overtime working, the figures for those in low paid
employment would have been higher. By the late 1980s and 1990s
the situation was little better, particularly for males, as Table 26.1
shows.

The situation was so desperate at the lower end of the skills market
that the Institute for Fiscal Studies was moved to say in 1994 that
'some men can no longer provide for themselves'. The trend towards
part-time work for men and women only compounded the problem.
In 1996 over 76 per cent of all part-time workers earned less than
the low wage threshold figure of £5.89 per hour; at the beginning of
the decade the figure for women on low wages (£4.92 per hour) in
part-time work had been 77.7 per cent. [34 ]
Thus, although the economy went through a modernising phase in
line with that occurring south of the border and throughout the
advanced economies of western Europe, there were aspects of this
transformation which were peculiar to Scotland. Firstly, in a very
short space of time Scotland went from being a producer of capital
goods to a provider of services. The collapse of the industrial economy
was at a faster rate than that experienced by England and the social
trauma resulting from it all the greater. Sylvia Clark, in her history
of Paisley, reinforces the quite extraordinary magnitude of socio-
economic changes experienced by Scottish workers and their families,
and the urban blight which resulted from them in the last few
decades, when she writes:

So the labour force in the Paisley factories was scaled down to
the hundreds, and then to dozens, and finally in the case of
Ferguslie Mills to nil. ... The area once occupied by Ferguslie
Mills is at the moment of writing [1988] not unlike a shell-
shattered No-man's-land m some war .... The older male

259


-----

inhabitants find it equally hard to accustom themselves to the
disappearance of the engineering works .... There are no brass-
founders or rope-makers. There is one cloth-finishing works ...
but no marmalade or potato crisps, or textile factories; no soap-
making; no smelly glue factory. The Linwood [car] works ...
finally died in the 1980s .... Even the Co-op ... the 'Big Co'
has gone ... there are no grocer's shops in the town centre ....
The latest departure in 1988 is Woolworths. [35 ]

Secondly, the manufacturing sector has become dominated by over-
seas capital; a phenomenon which has created unstable conditions of
employment. Thirdly, the growth of part-time work, particularly for
women, and higher levels of unemployment have had a corresponding
impact on Scottish incomes which have generally been below the UK
average. Finally, large scale out-migration has created a higher level
of dependency in the economy and a lower number of middle-class
occupations; only 31 per cent of economically active heads of house-
holds in Scotland were defined as middle class compared to 3 7 per cent
for Great Britain.[36 ] These changes have not only created difficult
challenges for the labour movement in Scotland, they have also led
to important changes in the social fabric of the country.
Throughout the inter-war period and the decades following the
end of the Second World War Scotland has experienced higher and
more enduring levels of deprivation than the rest of Britain. One
factor contributing to this situation in a major way has been unem-
ployment. Through the boom years of the 1950s and 1960s Scotland
experienced an unemployment rate twice that of the average rate for
the UK as a whole. Indeed, in 1961 with little more than 10 per cent
of the UK's population Scotland had more than 25 per cent of
long-term unemployedY During the years 1967 and 1979 the level
doubled, and in the period 1979 to 1983 it doubled again to stand at
14.6 per cent in May 1983, around one percentage point higher than
that for Britain. [38 ] Although in the 1990s the level of unemployment
in Scotland fell from 9.4 per cent in 1989 to 7.6 per cent in January
1997, part of this is due to the state altering the criteria of classifica-
tion from those looking for work to those claiming unemployment
benefit. [39 ] However, unemployment has been more prevalent among
males than females. Over the same period male unemployment
remained at more than twice the figure for females; a phenomenon
which, if the trend continues into the new millennium, will significantly
alter gender relationships within the household and the wider society. [40 ]

260


-----

There is, of course, a regional dimension to consider. Someone of
working age in Strathclyde in 1980 was twice as likely to be out of
work as someone in Grampian. However, the contrast is even more
marked if we examine unemployment by parliamentary constituen-
cy. Glasgow Provan had an unemployment rate of 35 per cent for
males aged 16-69, while Gordon in Grampian only had 3.8 per cent
of males in this age group out of work. [41 ] Many of the unemployed
had been out of work for more than six months; indeed, three out of
five men claiming benefit in May 1983 were in this category. [42 ] Once
unemployment grew to these proportions the effect was multi-depri-
vational as people's lives became blunted and restricted on a whole
series of different levels. A report by Strathclyde Social Work
Department in 1980 graphically showed the impact the closure of
Singers' Springburn factory had on welfare services in Glasgow.
Closure saw unemployment increase by 27 per cent in the city, rent
arrears by 21 per cent, clothing grants by the DHSS by 23 per cent,
reports to children's hearings by 38 per cent, as well as significant
increases in the rent and rebate awards. [43 ]
Thus, low pay and unemployment, as well as the increasingly age
dependent structure of the population, has led to a greater reliance
on social security. Between 1979 and 1982 the numbers claiming
Supplementary Benefit (SB) in Scotland increased from 450 000 to
770 000, or by nearly 70 per cent.[44 ] By 1991 just over a quarter of
Scottish households had a gross weekly income of less than £100 a
week to live on. [45 ] Much of the increase can be accounted for by the
growing numbers of OAPs and single parents on SB. In 1991 OAPs
accounted for 18 per cent of total population compared to 6 per cent
in 1901; indeed, female pensioners now outnumber girls under the
age of sixteen. Pensioners constitute one-third of those in poverty,
or around 240 000 people. [46 ] Family breakdown has also increased
the number of single parent families since 1945; in 1960 there were
only 2000 divorces in Scotland, but thirty years later the number had
increased to 12 400.47 Kay Carmichael estimated that, in the early
1980s, 31 per cent of single parent families were living below the
poverty line, and 50 per cent of them were on SB. [4] g

The upshot of all this is that one in five people in Scotland are living
in poverty and the low income of many Scots has had a significant
impact on the type and quality of housing available and their health. As
we have seen, most Scots in the inter-war years lived in cramped and
squalid housing supplied mainly through the private rented market.
Although there had been an increase in public sector housing with

261


-----

the construction of peripheral estates in the inter-war period, it was
really only after the Second World War that local authority building
programmes took off in a significant way. Jimmy Allison, Scottish
organiser of the Labour Party in the 1970s and 1980s, recalled in his
autobiography that at the age of 53 and 47 respectively his father
and mother were given their first council house which had an inside
toilet in Glenburn, Paisley, in 1954.[49 ] Indeed, the level of private
housing building after the war was negligible in Scotland, as in the
period 1946 to 1966 over 90 per cent of new housing stock was in
the public sector. However, due to expenditure cuts this fell to 49.4
per cent in the period 1976-80, and to 29.7 per cent in 1981-85
because of Tory government policy. 5°

The extent of public ownership of housing in Scotland was truly
phenomenal. David Niven points out that between 1967 and 1970
public housing construction in Scotland accounted for over 80 per
cent of housing completions which exceeded quite considerably the
rate in the Eastern bloc countries of Czechoslovakia and Poland. The
only Communist country to reach anything like the figure in Scotland
was Romania at 57 per cent. 5 [1 ]As a result owner-occupation, at only
31 per cent of total housing stock, was at much lower levels in the
1970s in Scotland compared to England and all of Western Europe,
although in the 1980s this had increased to around 42 per cent. [52 ] If
viewed more specifically by city, then, in the mid-1980s, 63 per cent of
Glaswegians, 57 per cent of Dundonians and 48 per cent of Aber-
donians lived in municipally-owned accommodation in, generally,
peripheral estates. In the cases of Drumchapel and Easterhouse in
Glasgow these housing estates constituted small, low amenity towns
of around 50 000 inhabitants. 5[3 ] Labour activist, Tommy Sheridan,
vividly described in his autobiography how the initial hopes of a
generation of slum dwellers from Govan were crushed amid the
social deserts of the new estate of Pollok in Glasgow:

The scheme was considered a paradise when my family arrived
in 1966 ... it was a paradise on paper .... The adults missed
stopping for a chat at Govan Cross. They missed going to the
pictures, the dancing, the shops. In Pollok there was no centre ....
Nowhere to stop and chat. Nowhere to have a drink or a dance.
Only churches, schools and a bit of windswept turf. [54 ]

The community spirit of slum life was traded for an indoor toilet and
bath; an experience replicated throughout Scotland with perhaps

262

_Economic and Social Change in Scotland_

even greater intensity in the smaller industrial towns of east and west
of Scotland where the publicly rented sector is even more entrenched.
According to Richard Rodger, in 1981, in Bellshill, Clydebank,
Coatbridge, Irvine, Livingston, Motherwell and Wishaw, more than
80 per cent of households were renting from the local authority.
There was also a general enthusiasm for high rise among councillors
and town planners and by 1969 Glasgow had built 163 tower blocks,
with the 22 acre Red Road complex of 31 storey blocks, housing
4000 being the most of extreme example of this kind of residential
brutality. [55 ]
In spite of the large concentrations of state-owned housing stock,
living conditions are far worse north of the border than south.
Glasgow's overcrowding level (more than 1.5 persons per room) in
1961 was 34.3 per cent compared to 10.7 per cent for Birmingham
and only 6.4 per cent for Manchester. In twelve of the city's 37
wards, one and two roomed houses accounted for over 60 per cent
of the stock, while in 15 wards over 60 per cent had no fixed bath
or WC. [56 ] In Dundee, in 1961, 35 per cent of housing was of the one
or two roomed variety and a quarter of the city's housing stock was
classed as sub-standardY Although conditions have improved since
the early 1960s -for example, only 6 per cent of Dundee housing
was considered sub-standard in 1981, and the overcrowding rate in
Glasgow fell from 46.9 per cent in 1951 to 26.0 per cent twenty
years later - much of the public housing in Scotland has become a
byword for decay, drugs and vandalism. The more upwardly mobile
workers have bought into the housing market or purchased their
council houses, leaving behind a population made up young families,
single mothers and OAPs, who find work hard to come by and are
generally living off state benefit. An in-depth study of the Ferguslie
Park housing estate in Paisley in the late 1970s found that half the
resident population were aged under twenty and only 10 per cent were
of pensionable age. Forty per cent of households were dependent on
social security benefits and male unemployment was running at 22
per cent compared with 10 per cent for Paisley and 4 per cent for
Great Britain.[58 ]
The overcrowding and generally unsatisfactory condition of hous-
ing and high concentrations of poverty in Scotland have had a major
impact on health standards. Although life expectancy for Scottish
men and women has grown quite considerably over the course of the
twentieth century and the IMR rate has fallen significantly, health
standards in Scotland still lag behind those in England and Wales. In

263


-----

19 81 life expectancy for Scottish men was two years lower than in
England and Wales. [59 ] The IMR fell to 19 per 1000 live births in the
1970s, but in terms of Western Europe only Belgium, Italy, Portugal
and Austria had worse rates.[60 ] These are national figures, of course,
and take no account of the incidence of social class. Statistics show
that in the 1980s manual workers were twice as likely to die before
reaching retirement than professionals, and the IMR was twice as
high in unskilled families compared to professional families. [61 ] Such
glaring inequalities led one health economist to conclude that 'the
greater ill-health of the Scottish people is the result of a higher
concentration of working-class people and poverty'. [62 ]
What this brief examination of the economy and social life of
Scotland suggests is that large portions of the working and non-
working population are trapped in a cycle of poverty which leads
to a culture of deprivation and a high dependence on the state for
survival. For those whose earnings remove them from leaning on the
benefits system, the high levels of employment generated by the state
for most of the period after 1945 and the predominance of public
sector housing, particularly in the industrial cities and towns, brings
them into personal contact with the state as either employer, landlord
or both. Scotland, therefore, has a more intimate relationship with
the state than England and, perhaps, as we will see, this goes some
way to explaining why voting patterns were so divergent in the

1970s and 1980s. However, of more immediate importance is what
kind of culture did the so-called 'nanny' state help create in Scotland
after the Second World War and how far has it changed in recent
times?

###### Chapter 27

##### THE AFFLUENT WORKER? WORKING-CLASS CULTURE,

#### 1945-1990s

The cultural world of the Scottish worker underwent profound
changes after 1945. The poverty of the 1930s gave way to greater
relative affluence in the 1950s and 1960s which created a more pri-
vatised way of life and consumerist mentality. The old community
solidarities gradually declined as urban populations were broken up
and dispatched to peripheral housing estates or new towns such as
Glenrothes or East Kilbride: 200 000 people were transferred from
Glasgow alone to these kinds of places in the period 1945-75. How-
ever, in the 1950s and the early years of the 1960s aspects of popular
culture which reflected older community links still flourished: the
Co-op, cinema, bingo, miners' welfare clubs, pigeon racing, singing
competitions, accordion bands and dancing at the local _palais de_
_dance_ on Friday and Saturday nights. Technology incrementally
eroded these recreational patterns as did the growth of out-of-town
shopping facilities and other cultural innovations. The mass ownership
of televisions rising from only 41 000 in 1952 to 1200 000 in the
mid-1990s, and, later, videos and computer games, saw the vibrant
street culture which Edwin Muir depicted in his social report of the
###### 1930s- Scottish Journey (1936)- disappear indoors. Workers, taking
advantage of cheap package holidays, became more cosmopolitan; a
phenomenon also aided by television which brought an increasingly
shrinking world into the living room. The Spanish Costas replaced
the west coast resorts as the summer destination of Scottish workers,
even though the former was made to feel like the latter, only with
sun. Holidays abroad and the influx of ethnic minorities from the Far
East resulted in a change in eating habits; mince n' tatties gave way
to lamb curries and fried rice. Aberdeen's first Chinese restaurant

265


-----

opened in Union Street in the early 1960s and by all accounts 'created
a considerable stir';[63 ] but by 1996 there were ten such restaurants in
addition to fifteen Indian establishments, as well as Turkish, Thai,
Italian, Greek and French eating places. The motor car also allowed
families away day excursions and created a market for out-of-town
superstores, further assisting the process of inner city decline. By
1981, thanks to the oil boom, 53 per cent of Aberdeen's households,
and 41 per cent of council tenants, owned a car, whereas in nearby
Dundee the respective figures were 43.5 per cent and 31 per cent. [64 ]
All these developments, coupled with the rapid decline of tradi-
tional industry wrought a profound rupture in working-class life in
Scotland; a process which Ian Jack's nostalgic portrait of his father,
a time-served engineering fitter, brilliantly captures. His father, Jack
writes:

ended his working life only a few miles from where he had
begun it, and in much the same way; in overalls and over a lathe
and waiting for the dispensation of the evening hooter, when he
would stick his leg over his bike and cycle home. He never owned
a house and he never drove a car, and today there is very little
public evidence that he ever lived .... Few of his workplaces
survive. The cargo steamer went to the scrapyard a long time ago,
of course, but even the shipping line it belonged to has vanished.
The coal pit is a field. Urban grassland and carparks have buried
the foundations of the mills. The house he grew up in has been
demolished and replaced with a traffic island. The school which
taught him the careful handwriting has made way for a super-
market.65

One of the cultural casualties of these economic and social changes
has been the co-operative movement. Once a recognised and essen-
tial part of working-class material and political culture- indeed, the
instant recall of one's share number was similar to remembering
one's telephone number today - the Co-op has ceased to play any
role in shaping the consciousness of workers in Scotland or elsewhere
in the UK, although it still has formal, if ever declining, links to the
Labour Party. As a result of the growth of cut-price supermarket
shopping, the share of the retail market in Britain held by the co-
operative societies declined from 11 per cent in 1960 to only 5 per cent
in 1986. The annual share dividend- 'the divvy'- has been abol-
ished and redundancies, deteriorating wages and market-orientated

266

_Working-Class Culture_

management have undermined even the loyalty of staff to the princi-
ples and ideals of the co-operative movement. Nowadays, the Co-op
is seen as just another High Street retail outlet and its former role as
one of the essential building blocks of working-class communities
has dissipated accordingly. [66 ]
All these developments have unhinged individuals from communi-
ties and allowed for a more privatised lifestyle which focuses on the
self and the nuclear, rather than the extended, family. One consequence
of the growth of more privatised lifestyles has been the gradual
reduction in the importance of voluntary social agencies, such as the
churches, in working-class areas. Religious observation remained
strong in the 1950s, with the Church of Scotland reaching its peak of
membership in 1956, and Sunday School enrolment rising by 41 per
cent in the years 1945-56.[67 ] Comparatively speaking, Scots in this
period were also more liable to be members of a Christian church
and attend services more regularly than the English or the Welsh. In
1951 only 23 per cent of the adult population of England and Wales
were church members, whereas in Scotland the figure was 59 per cent,
and attendance north of the border was around 26 per cent of adults
compared to 10-15 per cent in the south. [68 ] However, since then
church-going in Scotland has declined quite rapidly. According to
Calum Brown, church adherence in 1963 had reached a nadir. [69 ] By
1984 only 9 per cent of non-Catholics in Scotland attended church on
Sundays. However, the Catholic Church has maintained, until only
recently, quite a strong pull on its religious constituency. Its policy of
building churches in working-class housing estates has allowed the
church to maintain a constant dialogue with its parishioners. By the

1970s the Catholic Church had of all Christian churches in Scotland
the highest proportion of council tenants in membership.7° Since then
the number of parishioners has fallen, not simply because of falling
birth rates among Catholics, but because of the impact of the same
forces of secularisation which had undermined the ability of the
Presbyterian churches to resonate with the aspirations and experiences
of their constituency. The growth of scientific explanation and the
perceived establishment bias of the Protestant churches alienated
young people in the 1960s. Religion was dismissed as superstition
and out of touch with social realities. Although the churches have
taken a more active social and political role in addressing contempo-
rary concerns, and played an important part in the campaign for a
devolved assembly for Scotland, it has made little difference to
membership or attendance rolls. Perhaps, then, the main reason for

267


-----

the decline in religious observation among Scottish worker house-
holds is to be found in the fact that the churches have lost their social
role to the state. The marginalisation of the churches in the process of
dispensing social welfare has led people in times of acute distress to
turn to the state rather than to the gospel for solace.
Although the churches might blame materialism for falling mem-
bership rolls, the growing secularisation of the working class, indeed,
of all social classes, has had one important and beneficial consequence
in Scotland in as much as it has led to a diminution in sectarian rival-
ries and tensions. Although ritual battles are still fought out on the
terraces of Parkhead and Ibrox, sectarianism has been gradually
marginalised in modern Scotland due to economic and social change.
However, in the 1950s and 1960s sectarianism still played an impor-
tant role in determining one's life's chances. Unspoken embargos still
existed on employing Catholics in occupations, such as engineering,
printing, and, further up the occupational ladder, in banking, fire
service, quantity surveying, among others.7 [1 ] Sectarianism also per-
formed an important role in cementing industrial communities
together in opposition to the other. To be a 'Billy' or a 'Tim' provided
a sense of belonging as well as status to otherwise drab and increas-
ingly alienated forms of existence. That sense of belonging and of
hatred of the other was evocatively caught by Meg Henderson, in a
recent newspaper article, when she recalled that her grandmother, in
spite of the fact that half her grandchildren were Catholic, was 'a
bitter Orange woman'. When she died in the 1950s 'the plate on her
coffin carried her lodge number beside her name'. [72 ] It also was cap-
tured rather farcically in an incident in Singers factory in Springburn,
Glasgow. The engineering unions had negotiated an extra day's holi-
day in 1956 to be taken on Christmas Day. Alex Ferry, president of
the AEU, recalled that 'all hell broke loose' at Singers as Protestants
felt that 'catholics would be the chief beneficiaries since for them it
was a more significant occasion on which they were required to attend
mass'. The issue had to be put to a ballot and it was only carried by
a small majority 'despite the fact that more than half the workforce
were women' .7[3 ]

The decline of heavy industry and changing residential patterns,
however, have severed sectarian ties for much of the working popu-
lation, in as much as they led to the destruction of the kind of
close-knit industrial communities which previously had nurtured sec-
tarian loyalties and traditions. Economic transformation has ensured
that the grip or the right religion are no longer passports to an

apprenticeship or a job. Consequently, the association of generations
of families with a particular kind of employment through a system of
patrimony has broken down. The sons of formerly skilled workers
are forced to find work in the newer foreign-owned plants and service
industries whose hiring policies are religiously blind. Indeed, employers
in these sectors are generally more concerned to screen out trade
unionists than to discover the religious affiliation of a job applicant.
Therefore, the economic supports of sectarianism have been knocked
away and there seems little to be gained financially from adhering to
a sectarian tradition which is increasing seen as a sign of unsophisti-
cation. Socially, changing marriage patterns, due to a relaxation of
the Catholic Church's ban on mixed marriages in 1973, have led to
greater integration between Catholics and Protestants. The number
of mixed marriages in the Glasgow archdiocese involving a Catholic
was 44 per cent of total marriages in 1977, whereas in nearby Paisley
it was 48 per cent; these figures were 20 per cent higher than in
1966.7[4 ]

Because of these economic and social changes sectarianism has
been pushed to the margins of Scottish society, thriving mainly in the
small communities of east and west Scotland where solidarity and
conformity are easily enforced. A recent study of Orangeism in
Scotland pointed to the fact that two-thirds of the membership of the
Orange Order was over 45 which suggests that younger men and
women are turning away from sectarianism.?' Indeed, in the major
towns and cities religion plays little part in governing one's life
chances, or in finding a place to live, or, as we will argue below, in
determining political affiliation. The degree to which sectarianism
had become marginalised was effectively demonstrated in the failure
of paramilitary groups of both sides of the conflict to export the
'troubles' in Northern Ireland across the water, in spite of the fact
that the west of Scotland had strong historic links with Ulster, a large
Catholic population, and a history of sectarian strife.
The decline of religious influence and the traditional patterns of
leisure in favour of market-dictated recreational activities raised issues
for the authorities in Scotland and in the rest of Britain concerning
social control. Previously, voluntary agencies, such as temperance
societies, had performed a quasi-policing role over working-class
activities. However, their importance declined markedly in the
decades after 1945 and the lacuna which developed was filled by a
massive increase in local and national state intervention in the social
lives of workers and their families. Since the Second World War the

state has increasingly been responsible for the widespread provision
of recreation, including community centres, youth and sports organi-
sations, as well as traditional municipal facilities such as playing fields,
public baths, and so on, in order to, as a circular from the Scottish
Education Department put in 1946, avoid 'juvenile delinquency and
other social weaknesses'.7[6 ] By 1988, 65 per cent of voluntary sporting
activities in Scotland were being taken by state-sponsored youth
leaders and trained coaches.7[7 ] Additionally, legislation was passed
outlawing much of the 'rough' street culture, indeed, criminalising it,
which flourished even in the decades after the war, and making
aspects of it, such as gambling, legal and respectable. Although there
remain pockets of resistance to state control and market forces in
the form of alternative lifestyles, these are only subscribed to by a
minority of people and gradually, like punk rock, become assimilated
in time, in a highly modified manner, into mainstream culture.
Education has also played an important part in this process of
homogenising culture and ensuring greater influence of governing
bodies in shaping social attitudes. The Education Acts of 1945 and
1946 did not represent a major departure in educational philosophy,
although the school leaving age was increased to fifteen. The disparity
between educational provision and attainment between junior and
senior secondary schools continued to prevail; indeed, only 20 000 out
of 50 000 schoolleavers in the former had actually completed the full
three year course.7[8 ] The rising tide of juvenile delinquency perceived
by the authorities to be the result of alienation and failure among
young people, led to the introduction of major reforms in education.
The '0' level was introduced in 1962 to stem the tide of wastage and
was successful in raising the number of pupils achieving certification;
a phenomenon which led to a call for the abolition of the educational
divide and the establishment of a comprehensive schooling system.7[9 ]
This was duly introduced in 1965 and, as Andrew MacPherson
remarks, it involved the creation of a system based not on equality
of 'opportunity, but of treatment; that is, giving all individuals the
conditions in which they could continue to develop. And, because it
was universal, it implied policies that could and should be directed
at whole communities, and not just at individuals'. [80 ] But in the inner
cities the new schools fragmented along the lines of residence and
class and less working-class children benefited from the universalist
philosophy. It was only in new towns and rural areas that the new
system of schooling achieved the desired social mix.
Interestingly, standardisation of conditions introduced as part of

270

_Working-Class Culture_

comprehensive education provided the basis for greater solidarity
among teachers and this manifested itself in various industrial disputes
in the 1980s. However, although the system of education in Scotland
was nominally designed to improve relations between different social
classes and to create more socially responsible young adults, it still
failed a large number of working-class children and through religious
segregation maintains a level, if somewhat diminished, of sectarian
rivalry. It also has created ladders of opportunity for ambitious and
talented working-class children to attain higher qualifications and
achieve professional status. In 1868, the class profile of students in
Scottish universities was one-sixth working-class; in 1961, it was a
quarter, and by the year 2000 it is estimated that it will reach 40 per
cent. [81 ] This development, however, further entrenches the process of
fragmentation within traditional industrial communities as highly
qualified sons and daughters move elsewhere in search of employment
and homes.
With the disappearance or break-up of these traditional industrial
communities and the fragmenting impact of changes in the economy
and society, it becomes increasingly difficult to speak nowadays of
the existence of a working-class culture. Indeed, the CPGB, in the
light of these developments, was moved to declare in May 1989 that
the 'fact and language of the working class as the main agent of
political change is a thing of the past'. [82 ] To the new left the mentalities
of consumption and the culture of spectacle, rather than those asso-
ciated with community and participation, had come to dominate
working-class consciousness. The power to consume was seen as
more than anything else the social cement of late capitalism. For
those unable or unwilling to be a part of the consumer society, the
abyss of the underclass awaits with a never-ending cycle of poverty
and social isolation. While in many ways this is true, it would be
myopic to ignore the values of democracy, fairness and social justice
which still influence in profound ways the social outlook of most
workers. Moreover, fragmentation has not diminished the efforts of
the authorities to control the activities of workers and their families;
in many respects this has increased. As in previous eras, control is
never absolute and is subject to a constant process of negotiation
and re-negotiation among the controllers and the controlled. For
this study the question which arises from the cursory discussion of
working-class culture is how far cultural fragmentation has mirrored
changes in the nature of work and workplace relations?

##### THE END OF SKILL? WORK AND WORKPLACE RELATIONS
 IN SCOTLAND, 1945-1990s

The shifting structures of the economy and the labour market, as
well as working-class culture, were related to the pace of technolog-
ical change. Normally, innovations in techniques and machinery will
occur more extensively and rapidly in conditions of rising demand
in an economy, and will decline or stagnate in conditions of falling
demand. Scotland in the inter-war years experienced declining demand
for capital goods and other products and this acted as a disincentive
to producers to improve the methods and machinery of production.
Thus, employers mainly concerned themselves with extending and
refining existing machinery and techniques throughout industry. The
post-Second World War economic boom, however, created a more
optimistic climate among employers and investment in new technol-
ogy grew rapidly.
In the building industry, the process of prefabrication had devel-
oped so extensively that as early as 1947 the president of the
Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers (ASW) considered that many
of the jobs could be done by 'mere process workers'. [83 ] As tanker
building began to dominate the output of the Clyde in the 1950s it
called for flowline methods of construction using the maximum
amount of prefabrication. This increased the demand for welding
skills; a development which 'led to the rapid decline in [the] numbers
of riveters' and the usurpation of some of the plater's functions in
rolling and shaping metal. [84 ] The simplicity of tanker construction
meant that there were few opportunities to exercise traditional skills. [85 ]
The allied steel industry saw key processes fully automated in the
1960s; this undermined the personalised system of steel-making which
in the past had depended 'on the closely guarded skill and judgement

272

of the men who ran the furnaces'. [86 ] Similarly, in the other great jewel
in the industrial crown - the coal industry - there was a profound
reorganisation of production methods with the introduction in the
1950s of power-loading machinery. The new machines stripped the
coal off the face layer by layer and simultaneously loaded it on to an
armoured conveyor which followed along the coal face. Coal could
now be cut on all shifts, whereas in the inter-war period only one
shift cut and the others prepared and cleared. By the 1960s the
Armoured Flexible Cutter had been installed in alllongwall faces in
Britain. [87 ]
These innovations did nothing to halt the decline of heavy industry
in Scotland; however, the shift from heavy to light manufacturing
industry also did nothing to enhance the skill base of Scottish
workers. The branch plants established by incoming overseas firms
placed emphasis on semi-skilled assembly work and a dispropor-
tionate small reliance on technical and skilled workers. Much of the
work involved the hand preparation of printed circuit boards; a task
seen as eminently suitable to women workers. The multinational firms
which set up in Scotland in the 1960s, and beyond, therefore, accel-
erated the deskilling processes already at work in the economy. These
developments also affected technical workers, such as draughtsmen
and designers, normally thought to be outside the industrial prole-
tariat. In 1963 the Technical and Salaried Staff Association listed
seven broad categories of technical worker. Ten years later this had
grown to 468 different categories which is evidence of the degree to
which the division of labour had affected this once privileged group
of 'office' workers. [88 ]
Technological change was also experienced by workers assumed
to be outside the dynamic sectors of the economy. The jute industry
of Dundee underwent a process of profound technological change in
the years 1949-55, with automatic machinery replacing manual
labour and increasing the workload of weavers. By 1946 the labour
force had shrunk to 13 000, or by two-thirds since 1929. [89 ] An outlay
of £11m in replacing obsolete spinning and weaving machinery by the
employers was rewarded with a 32 per cent increase in productivity. [90 ]
Farmwork was also becoming more mechanised as tractors replaced
horse-drawn implements. In 1939 there were 6250 tractors in use on
Scottish farms. By 1944 this had increased to 20 158 as wartime
demand and failing supplies of labour forced farmers to become
more capital intensive. [91 ] Another supposedly unskilled occupation to
have undergone profound change after 1945 was clockwork. Formerly

273

it was based on the muscle power of a largely casual workforce, but
the introduction in the 1960s of automatic methods of handling cargo
and containerisation eliminated the physical aspects of clockwork and
reduced the numbers employed in the industry. [92 ]
The service sector too has witnessed changes incurred through new
technological regimes which have revolutionalised working methods.
The growth of large retail outlets reduced much of shopwork to filling
shelves and running tills, and the increased used of prepackaged
goods led to the abandonment of the six years grocery apprenticeship.
As point of sale equipment became more sophisticated, even simple
addition skills became redundant. However, as shop workers were
progressively deskilled, the administration of their activities, and
those of other workers, were also subject to greater specialisation
and sub-division of labour. Crompton and Jones have shown that
clerical work is more easily deskilled than manual work since it is
conducted largely through the medium of paper. This makes it easier
to arrange and rearrange the office on the principles of scientific
management. [93 ] The advent of word processors and sophisticated
computer software programs has reduced the skill content of the
work performed by the majority of clerical workers, and this has
done much to encourage functional specialisation. The effect is to
narrow both the range and scope of clerical work and, at the same
time, enhance the power of the organisation over the individual. [94 ]
Have then clerks become the modern white-collar proletariat? If
we take a strictly Marxist definition of the working class as a section
of society producing surplus value, then clerks do not easily fit the
description, but as Richard Hyman points out, there are 'significant
affinities' since the clerk 'adds to the capitalist's income by helping
him reduce the costs of realizing surplus value'; thus, his work is a
source of profit to the employer. [95 ] From this we can build a theory of
exploitation and deskilling round the historical and actual experience
of the clerk. However, that does not mean to say that the conditions
of service in a capitalist enterprise between clerks and manual workers
are essentially the same. Historically, clerks have enjoyed access to a
promotion ladder, which some sociologists argue is a key difference
between both grades of labour, [96 ] and have experienced greater job
security and perks, such as different eating facilities. This view has
become somewhat less convincing in recent years as new research
influenced by the rise of women's studies has shown that since 1951
the vast majority of low level clerical workers are female, many
part-time, and are outside the sphere of promotion. [97 ] Increasing

274


-----

_Work_ _and Workplace Relations in Scotland_

feminisation has led to a narrowing of income differentials between
male white-collar workers and skilled manual workers and, in the
period 1970-78, a definite falling behind of the former.
Studies of the social origins of clerical workers also show an
increasing bias towards those from working-class backgrounds. One
study of London clerks showed that in 1935 one-in-three came from
working-class backgrounds; twelve years later the comparable figure
was one-in-two. [98 ] This was also true of the new breed of technical
workers who emerged in the 1960s and 1970s. Chris Smith found
that craftsmen in the engineering industry 'provided the main reser-
voir of recruits into the new technical occupations' and that most
had came through the apprenticeship system. Such training ensured
that white-collar technical workers had a craft, rather than a profes-
sional mentality, instilling in them a sense of collective identity. [99 ]
Thus, not only is the idea of a career ladder in white-collar work a
notional one, the process of family socialisation and workplace
experience also produced collectivist mentalities amenable to the
introduction of trade unions; something which will be discussed in
more depth later.
The motives behind the introduction of new technologies were
primarily economic as employers hoped that it would lower production
costs and/or increase output. However, it also created opportunities
to challenge skilled labour's independence in the workplace and open
skilled work up to intrusion from semi- and unskilled workers. Thus,
accompanying changes in technology were changes in the character
of supervision and industrial discipline. Indeed, it could be argued
that in the post-1945 era there took place a revolution in workplace
ideas on authority and discipline. New systems of control were
introduced as the older systems proved incompatible with greater
bureaucracy and increased workers' power. The power of the foreman
was markedly reduced as the introduction of time measurement for
jobs presumed that wages clerks and personnel departments in large
firms took responsibility for the recruitment and payment of workers.
Foremen were downgraded to supervisors responsible for discipline
and with some control over the pace and intensity of the work rhythm,
but no longer an indispensable part of the management structure of
a firm. The decline of family ownership also reduced the scope for
paternalistic control of labour. Although 34.8 per cent of Glasgow
firms surveyed in the 1950s claimed to provide welfare amenities of
some kind for their workers, [100 ] the extension of local authority
housing and the welfare state neutralised the attractiveness of these

275

benefits for workers. Morris and Smyth found that workers in the
autocratic firm of Prinlaws, Kirkcaldy, preferred the 'minimal level
of welfare capitalism provided by new firms to the demanding
involvement of paternalism' .[101 ]
The exercise of power by employers had to be achieved in other
ways. Some employers did continue to use high levels of company
welfarism as a means of promoting worker loyalty and non-unionism.
Studies of manufacturing firms such as IBM and various financial
institutions have shown how higher wages and certain fringe benefits,
such as cheaper mortgages, have been used to manufacture such
outcomes. [102 ] More recently, incoming Japanese firms have placed all
employees on staff conditions, which include a wide range of fringe
benefits; this does much to promote a greater sense of company
loyalty. [103 ] However, since 1945 the majority of firms have increas-
ingly resorted to the wage packet as the best way of securing power
over the workforce. The system of piece-rate payment which devel-
oped in the late nineteenth century and linked the level of wages to
output, as well as encouraging individual rather than collective bar-
gaining, was widespread throughout Scottish industry in the 1940s
and 1950s. Half the workforce in coalmining, including all face
workers, were on piece-rate, and it was nearly universal in engineer-
ing.104 However, the emergence of full employment and a stronger
trade union movement saw employers move away from piece-rate to
a measured day work system (based on hourly rates and performance
standards established by work measurement techniques) first in
coalmining in the 1960s, and, later, in engineering, shipbuilding,
clockwork and the motor car industry. [105 ] In any case, the old piece-
rate system was only found to be effective in enlarging management's
power in times when a reserve pool of labour exerted a downward
pressure on wages, conditions which did not exist in the long eco-
nomic boom of the post-1945 years. They were also highly complex
and the subject of recurring disputes over their interpretation. The
declining usage of piece-rate payments produced two contradictory
effects: firstly, it encouraged the growth of collective bargaining by
establishing uniform national rates for all workers in an industry;
and secondly, it increased the degree of supervision to which workers
were subjected. As a representative worker in a leading car manu-
facturer put it:

When you go back to the old piece work system the discipline
comes from the shop floor. There was certainly a great deal less

276


-----

supervision; but under the measured day work system the laws
are made at the top and there is supervision which I consider to
be 'policemen' in many ways to carry out these laws. This is the
vast difference between the old system and the new system. [106 ]

The motor car industry saw the number of supervisors increase from
three to run the plant along with a manager, superintendent and a
foreman, to a supervisor for every 25 men. This was also the experi-
ence of the coal industry. [10]7

The progressive deskilling of the labour force combined with a
tightening of industrial discipline would suggest that Scottish workers
were rendered powerless to combat the assault on traditional skills
and working practices by capital. However, as mentioned previously,
the nature of the product, the structure of the market and the degree
of worker resistance provide important barriers to deskilling. These
barriers are more obvious in the area of skilled work, but they are
also influential in occupations that are considered unskilled, or
labelled as white-collar. In the shipbuilding industry, the historic
reluctance of employers to add substantially to fixed overhead capital
because of the vulnerability of the industry to shifts in world demand
meant that they continued to rely on skill intensive methods of
production. As late as 1978 a shop steward described the Robb Caledon
yard in Aberdeen as an 'industrial museum', adding, 'we have a
shaping machine dated 1910, a borer that no one knows the age of
and a pipe-bending machine that was taken as reparations in 1918
from the Germans' .[108 ] Some years earlier a report by the SEF noted
that:

The present organisation of shipyard labour so far as skilled
trades are concerned, and the work that each trade may under-
take, is largely based on the pattern set when iron and, later,
steel ships were first built in this country. [1]0[9 ]

Where management was successful in introducing new machinery
and working methods, such as the multiple punch and welding, they
were appropriated by the boilermakers. Similarly, the unstandardised
nature of much engineering work meant that new techniques were
inoperable in many establishments. Moreover, in the modern and
increasingly computerised sector of the economy research has shown
that workers have greater freedom to organise their work and the
speed at which it is performed. Computerisation has increased the

277


-----

demand for high level skills in the areas of programming and systems
analysis, as well as in management information systems. [110 ]
Another consideration to take into account is that while techno-
logical change can result in the destruction of traditional skills, at the
same time, it can also change the nature of existing skills, or, indeed,
create new ones. In coalmining progressive technical change made
the old collier's skills redundant, but it also created a greater demand
for skilled maintenance staff and electricians. In 1957 maintenance
craftsmen accounted for 6 per cent of the total mining workforce in
Great Britain; by 19 81 the figure had increased to 20 per cent. [111 ] In
the highly automated electronics industry there has been an appre-
ciable rise in the level of skill; a phenomenon which poses a major
threat to the jobs of semi-skilled workers as hand preparation of
printed circuit boards declines sharply. [1 ][12 ] Therefore, the impact of
technological change can be contradictory and does not necessarily
presume an irresistible move in the direction of a defenceless and
deskilled proletariat of the kind envisaged by Braverman and others. [113 ]
However, what is clear from the discussion is that traditional craft
skills have disappeared over the course of the twentieth century and
with them the existence of a culture and system of values to which
they gave rise. The independent craftsman symbolised in the owner-
ship of tools, the extensive system of workplace rituals and cere-
monies, which served to emphasise his status in the workplace and
underpin the values of craft pride and solidarity, disappeared with
the arrival of the stopwatch, quality control, planning offices and
modern technology. In his place emerged the semi-skilled assembly
worker and the technician, more specialised and subject to greater
managerial discipline. Other workers outside the realm of skilled
work also experienced the passing of established working habits
and customs, indeed, a whole way of life. The National Dock Labour
Scheme and the decline in port transport destroyed the culture and
community of dockworkers as family employment networks disap-
peared. The same point could also be made in respect of mining com-
munities in the 1980s in Scotland. The disappearance of traditional
working-class communities, however, should not be seen as providing
justification for nostalgic longings for the 'old days'. The ownership
of skill was always exclusive and sectional. Outsiders such as women
and the Irish were always denied access to apprenticeships through
some form or other of trade practice. Moreover, deskilling can result
in increased opportunities for upward mobility, if measured in terms
of the wage bargain, for those workers classed as unskilled. Although

278


-----

_Work and Workplace Relations in Scotland_

specific figures for Scotland do not exist to any great extent, within
a British context the twentieth century has witnessed a narrowing of
wage differentials between skilled and unskilled workers. Between
1935 and 1955 average wages for unskilled workers increased by
337 per cent over their 1935 level, while the corresponding increase
for skilled workers was 319 per cent. From the 1960s onwards differ-
entials further narrowed; this was particularly marked in the 1970s
due to the egalitarian effects of incomes policies. [114 ] The main wages
divide nowadays is between men and women rather than between
skilled and unskilled. In 1981, the average earnings of a working
woman in Scotland was 60-62 per cent of the male average. In 1991
the gap had slightly narrowed to 68.1 per cent; a figure, however,
lower than that for England and Wales, where the differential was 71
per cent. [115 ]
The magnitude of these changes in the labour market, in the
nature and distribution of skills, and the social world of the worker,
has had, as one might expect, highly important consequences for the
character and development of trade unionism in Scotland since
1945. The question arises as to how far they influenced the growth
in union membership and whether this had any impact on the level
of labour militancy in Scotland.

###### Chapter 29

##### THE DEMISE OF CRAFT UNIONISM
 AND THE RISE OF WHITE-COLLAR UNIONS IN SCOTLAND, 1945-1990s

The inter-war years had witnessed important changes in the nature
of the trade union movement in Scotland. Amalgamations with
English unions destroyed the insularity and nationalism of trade
unions north of the border. By 1947 only 15.1 per cent of trade
unionists in Scotland were members of exclusively Scottish unions
and only one member of the General Council of the STUC repre-
sented a Scottish-based union; whereas in 1897 only one member of
the Parliamentary Committee had represented a British union. [116 ]
Amalgamation also led to the disappearance of smaller organisations,
and by 1947 the largest seventeen unions accounted for over 70 per
cent of members, making for higher levels of concentration in
Scotland than that for the UK as a whole. Occupationally, the bulk
of these union members were in 1947 located in coalmining, con-
struction, metals and machines, transport, including the railways,
and general labouring. The high representation of traditionally
male-dominated occupations in the Scottish labour movement
emphasised the sexual division of labour in the workplace. Although
there was a modest increase in the number of women trade unionists
in Scotland between 1924 and 1947, female members still only
accounted for 18.1 per cent of the total number at the latter date. [117 ]
However, since 1947 Scottish trade unionism has undergone a tran-
sition in keeping with that taking place in the wider economy and
society.
The chief characteristics of this process of transition are: firstly, an
increase in white-collar and a decline in industrial trade unionism;
secondly, an expansion in general unions at the expense of those based
on occupation; and lastly, an expansion in the number of women

280

_Demise of Craft Unionism_ _and Rise of White-Collar Unions_

becoming union members. Unfortunately, given the level of union
amalgamation taking place since 1945, accurate density figures are
not available separately for Scotland. In the absence of such data,
affiliations to the STUC have been used as the best way of estimating
the number of trade unionists in Scotland.

On this basis Laurie Hunter has estimated that in 1951 there were
85 unions affiliated to the STUC with a combined membership of
730 000; by 1980 the number of unions had fallen to 73, while the
total membership had increased to 1 070 000. The degree of union
concentration had become even more marked with eleven unions
accounting for over 71 per cent of the total membership in Scotland. [118 ]
Within this totality there was a massive shift in the occupational
composition of the membership. In 1960 the industrial section of the
STUC (mining and quarrying, railways, transport, metals and
machines, construction) accounted for 57 per cent of the total affili-
ated membership, while the service sector (distributive trades, public
employees and general workers) contained 26 per cent. Ten years later
the industrial section had declined to 48 per cent, while the service
section grew to 42 per cent, in spite of an alteration in classification.
By 1980 sections 8 and 9 (civil and public servants and non-manual
workers) alone were responsible for 45 per cent of the STUC's affili-
ated membership, and five years later the figure reached 51 per cent. [119 ]
The rise in the representation of non-manual workers was partly due
to the increase in the organisation of female workers in Scotland.
From accounting for 18.8 per cent of total STUC membership in 1951,
the number of affiliated female members grew to 35.2 per cent in
1979. [120 ] By the late 1970s, 40 per cent of female workers in Scotland
were union members, representing a higher organised density than
women in England had achieved. [121 ]

The broad changes in the occupational and gender profile of trade
unionism in Scotland raise further questions regarding the motive
forces behind such a transformation, and how the decline of craft
and/or manual unions and the rise of white-collar organisations has
altered the character of the labour movement north of the border. In
addressing the first, it is obvious that the economic and technological
changes discussed above are crucial as they significantly altered the
nature of white-collar work and created the objective conditions for
an increase in trade union membership. However, although the long-
term conditions for union growth in the service sector undoubtedly
existed, the realisation was problematic. During the inter-war years
white-collar trade unionism was negligible, and even in the 1940s

281


-----

and 1950s, and in spite of favourable union legislation, organisation
of the service sector moved at a snail's pace. Thus, short-term factors
must be explored before the question of union growth among white-
collar workers can be resolved.
As one might expect, it was in the public sector that trade unionism
first gained a foothold, but in the decade 1968-78 the growth in the
organisation of white-collar workers exploded in all sectors. By 1978
the number of white-collar trade unionists in Britain increased by
two million; a two-thirds increase on the 1968 figure. [122 ] In Scotland,
the National Association of Local Government Officers (NALGO)
saw its affiliated membership of the STUC grow from 24 409 in 1969
to 62 043 in 1979 and the Association of Scientific, Technical and
Managerial Staff (ASTMS) increase from 9036 to 32 629 over the
same period. [123 ] In the private sector, the Banking, Insurance and
Finance Union (BIFU) in 1968 became the first white-collar union to
gain national recognition independently of government help and
represented around 71 per cent of banking workers in Scotland. [124 ]
For the other white-collar unions the state was crucial to the creation
of a climate of expansion. The setting up of the Donovan Commission
in 1965 and the subsequent extension of collective bargaining rights
which followed its recommendation, along with the Industrial
Relations Act of 1971 and the Employment Protection Act of 1975,
were instrumental in securing recognition and bargaining rights for
white-collar workers. Economic stimulus was also important.
Historically high levels of inflation as well as prices and incomes
policies in the 1960s and 1970s led to an erosion of white-collar
workers' real wages and this led them to join trade unions in increas-
ing numbers to protect their standard of living. The success of the
unions in achieving this goal simply reinforced the process. However,
this raises the question of class consciousness. Did the growth of union
membership among white-collar workers alter the character of trade
unionism in Scotland to any significant degree? Was it a force for
moderation or militancy?
Before addressing these issues, it is important to examine the
gradual demise of craft-based industrial unionism in order to decide
whether, as the rising aspirations and interests of white-collar workers
increasingly came to dominate its outlook, the Scottish labour move-
ment experienced a sea change in attitude and ethos. As we have seen
in previous chapters, the position of the skilled male Protestant trade
unionist in industry was entrenched. It was his interests and values
which lay at the core of the concerns of the labour movement north

of the border. Although inroads into the hegemony of the skilled
workers were made by both the unskilled and women during the
inter-war years, craft unionism displayed a dogged resistance in the
post-1945 decades to the forces of change and transformation. It
took a very long time for craft workers to relinquish their control of
the leadership of the Scottish labour movement. In the struggle to
preserve craft privilege, labour leaders employed a variety of strate-
gies, varying from sectionalism, to sectarianism, to political influence;
sometimes in a subtle, and sometimes in a crude manner, but always
in an effective way.
In the shipbuilding industry unions employed an industrial strategy
based around control of the labour process to protect their respective
trades from the pressures of skill dilution. The traditional belief among
the labour force that once work was lost it would be lost forever led
to demarcation disputes in the 1950s and 1960s. Platers and burners
fought with each other to control flame-cutting and planing mach-
inery and, later, these disputes extended to computerised cutting
heads. [125 ] Welders restricted entry to the trade and refused to allow
unemployed members of other shipbuilding trades to operate welding
equipment. [126 ] Boilermakers used apprenticeship and separate agree-
ments governing their terms of employment to maintain differentials
with other shipyard trades. These differentials were maintained even
during the famous 1972 Upper Clyde Shipbuilders work-in. Payments
to those taking part in the work-in were made on the basis of take
home pay prior to taking industrial action. [127 ] Sectional strategies
such as these, however, failed as shipyard after shipyard closed in the
1970s and 1980s. But other craft unions followed the example of
the Boilermakers. In the building industry the ASW opposed the for-
mation of an industrial union for all construction workers, defeating
a resolution at its 1959 annual conference 'overwhelmingly' on this
question. The woodworkers naively believed that the organisational
strength of the union and the manual dexterity of the woodworker
would cushion it against the forces of change. [128 ] Like the shipbuilders,
they were severely disappointed.
Religion also played a part in maintaining craft exclusiveness.
Alex Ferry, later president of the AEU, recalled, as a young Catholic
male in the 1940s, that:

###### It was still much more difficult for aRC to be employed in the
craft trade than it was for others .... I discovered that myself
when I was trying to find an apprenticeship. The employer ...

283


-----

would ask you which school you had gone to ... if you tried to
cover it up, you were then asked about the Boy Scouts and the
Boys' Brigade .... Notwithstanding that, I managed to get an
apprenticeship in one of the less desirable engineering compa-
nies in Clydebank .... when I moved into the Singer Sewing
Machine Co. in 1954 ... the effects of discrimination were even
more glaring. The tool room, where I was, employed around
300 people ... You could have counted the Catholics on the
digits of your two hands and, in the shop in which I worked, I
was the only Catholic.l29

The power of the foreman to hire and fire, as well as the close-knit
occupational networks, made it possible to use religion to police
the boundaries of skill well into the post-Second World War era.
However, this brand of exclusionism broke down in the 1960s as
skill shortages emerged and the number of religiously-blind foreign
firms setting-up in Scotland began to increase.
A more subtle way of preserving the traditions of craft unionism
was through occupational transfer. Large numbers of redundant
engineering and shipbuilding workers found their way into car plants
and began to organise themselves around craft principles. This led to
mounting industrial unrest in the 1960s as traditionally autonomous
workers attempted to adapt to the routinised demands of assembly-
line production. [130 ] Between 1963 and 1969 there were 300 stoppages
in the car industry in Scotland. [131 ] Although the number of disputes fell
in the 1970s, the experience of the car industry is a potent example
of the difficulties created by cultural readjustment on the part of
skilled workers and the way patterns of industrial organisation were
transferred from a decaying industry to a rising one. By these means
craft attitudes were, at least for a time, kept alive in a totally different
working environment.
Yet another way of sustaining the craft culture and its material
base was through influencing government policy, particularly with
concensus-minded governments. Trade union policies regarding min-
imum wage fixing, legal immunities, health and safety standards,
and so on, have often needed government support in the past; thus it
could be argued that the post-1945 era was little different in regard
to state and labour relations. However, winning state assistance for
trade union economic and social policies was allied to the continued
support by the government for the staple industries in which most of
the craft unions were to be found. At the local level, Labour politicians,

284


-----

_Demise of Craft Unionism_ _and Rise of White-Collar Unions_

by ensuring that nationally agreed wage rates and conditions were
implemented on council contracts and that non-union firms were
denied work, also played a significant part in preserving the craft
culture. However, the main vehicle for providing the craft culture
with an influential voice in the policy-making circles of the local and
national state has been the STUC and its General Council. Since its
involvement in the early experiments of the 1930s in corporatism, the
relationship with the STUC and the state has grown. James Craigen
estimated that by 1973 well over 1500 trade unionists were serving
on boards and committees as diverse as the Scottish Postal Board, the
Parole Board for Scotland, and the Consultative Committee for
Edinburgh Airport, as well as the main government committees, such
as the National Economic Development Council. [132 ] The enhanced
economic and social role of the STUC brought trade unions leaders
into closer contact with leading civil servants and politicians, and
their co-operation and views on the running of the economy were
increasingly sought by governments. Obviously, those unions domi-
nating the General Council of the STUC were in a stronger position
to influence government policy than those outside it, particularly in
regard to the question of state subsidies to failing industries.
For most of the twentieth century the General Council has been
dominated by the numerically superior craft/industrial unions, and
even in the changing conditions of employment which emerged after
1945, the skilled men's unions were able to maintain their power
base within the STUC, as Table 29.1 shows.

Although the influence of the skilled workers' organisations has
undoubtedly declined since 1960, it must be remembered that in recent
years the numerically larger general unions, such as the TGWU, have,
due to mergers with craft unions, contained skilled sections. The
Boilermakers, for example, are now part of the General Municipal
and Boilermakers' Union and through it are still able to exercise an
influence, albeit a reduced one, on the wider movement. However,
it is clear that, until the 1980s when the Thatcher government fun-
damentally altered the relationship between the unions and the state,
the interests of the skilled workers were still paramount within the
labour movement in Scotland and that enabled them to win reprieve
after reprieve for their ailing industries from successive Labour and
Tory governments.
The final factor in delaying the decline of the craft culture has been
the ability of male trade unionists to resist successfully: firstly, to
resist the encroachment of female labour into the realm of skilled
work; and secondly, to marginalise women's issues within the labour
movement and to discourage them from taking an active part in the
running of the unions in which they form a substantial majority. The
labelling of women's work as unskilled and of lower value than that
performed by a man has traditionally been used by employers and
trade unions to justify keeping women in a subordinate and less
well paid position in the workplace. Little has happened to alter this
perception in the decades after 1945. The Equal Pay Act of 1975 was
passed to give women and men doing the same, or broadly similar,
work the same level of reward; however, this has done little to
improve the economic position of women. It has proven very difficult
in job evaluation schemes to show that men and women are doing
like work, and then there is the question of evasion and subterfuge by
employers. Perhaps, it is because of this that cases under the legisla-
tion in Scotland fell quite dramatically from 199 in 1976 to just 19
in 1978. [133 ]
Women might have been able to address these inequalities in the
workplace had they been in more influential positions within the
labour movement. However, statistics show that while their mem-
bership of trade unions grew in the decades after 1945, this has not
brought a commensurate increase in influence. According to Esther
Brietenbach, in 1979 over 40 per cent of women workers were
members of trade unions in Scotland, compared to just under 38 per
cent for Great Britain, and they accounted for 35.2 per cent of STUC
membership, compared to 28.4 per cent for the TUC; whereas in

286


-----

_Demise of Craft Unionism_ _and Rise of White-Collar Unions_

1951 the respective Scottish figures were only 21.0 and 18.8. [134 ]
During this period only two women served on the General Council
of the STUC- Louise Stein (1955-57) and Elizabeth Mcintyre as
chairperson in 1973 -a figure which compared unfavourably to the

1930s when, in spite of lower levels of membership, three
###### women- Agnes Gilroy (1932-34), Bell Jordan (1933-42) and Isabel
Binnie (1935-36)- were members of the Council. [135 ] The situation at
individual union level was no better. Although females in the health
service union- COHSE- in Scotland in 1981 accounted for 81 per
cent of total membership, only 27.6 per cent of branch secretaries
were women. The National Union of Public Employees had 65 per
cent of members who were female, yet only 4.4 per cent of branch
secretaries and 25 per cent of shop stewards fell into this category.
Ironically, in the engineering union - the AEEU - women have fared
slightly better: 3.39 per cent of branch secretaries are female, while
women only account for 13.8 per cent of the members. [136 ] A decade
later things had changed little in spite of more union amalgamations
and a greater level of awareness among women regarding gender
issues. Although women made up 61.2 per cent of the membership
of NALGO only 38.7 per cent of the union's elected officers were
female, and that was fairly typical of all the large unions, with the
exception of the TGWU and the shop workers' union- USDAW.
These organisations represented the nadir and the peak of female
representation in the ranks of elected officials. [137 ]
Thus, the ethos of the Scottish labour movement remains deeply
patriarchal and shifts in the occupational profile of the labour
market have done little to alter this. The idea that a woman's place
is in the home, although less compelling than formerly, is still a
strong and pervasive one in Scottish society. This was demonstrated
during the miners' strike of 1984 in which women were supposedly
accorded an important role in maintaining solidarity. However, oral
accounts of the strike suggest that involvement in the dispute beyond
'running bingo nights' and working in 'the soup kitchen' was all that
was acceptable to the men. As two wives of Dysart miners put it:

Some jist didnae want women around - they had the attitude
that it was OK for us to be in the strike centre washing dishes
and making meals - but let them do the 'men's work' .... a lot
of them were happy to see women involved, as long as the
women were doing things the men's way and for the men's
benefit. But as soon as we started wanting to do things for

287


-----

ourselves ... they didnae really like that very much .... They
didnae like us doing things without their permission .... men

[were] ... wanting the women to become involved as long as it
wasn't their wives because it was going to rock the domestic
boat. [138 ]

By marginalising women's issues and keeping them, even in disputes
that involved whole communities, in a subordinate position, the male-
dominated trade unions in Scotland were able to keep the focus of
industrial relations on the narrow concerns of craft and related
industrial workers. But what kind of system of industrial relations
did the largely misogynist Scottish labour movement produce in the
post-war decades?
###### It has to be appreciated that the tempo of industrial relations
was governed to a large extent by the profound restructuring of the
Scottish economy and social life which took place after 1945. The
decline of staple industries and working-class communities, and the
impact this had on the mentalities of craft and other industrial
workers, created a mood of bitterness and led to high levels of indus-
trial conflict. According to Laurie Hunter, during the period 1952 to
1980, the number of industrial stoppages in Scotland was twice the
UK rate, the workers involved averaged about 40 per cent above
the UK rate, and working days lost about 55 per cent above. [139 ] More
disputes occurred in the Scottish coalfields in the 1960s than in any
other district of the NCB, with the exception of South Wales and
Yorkshire. [140 ] Strike activity, as measured by working days lost, was
running at a much higher level in manufacturing industry than else-
where.

What caused this eruption in strike activity? The answer lies in a
combination of local factors, associated with worker fears, values

288

_Demise of Craft Unionism and Rise of White-Collar Unions_

and location, and national ones, associated with government eco-
nomic policies and labour market restructuring. Skilled workers,
particularly in the integrated heavy industries of the west of Scotland,
had developed a set of industrial attitudes towards capital forged by
decades of cyclical unemployment, economic hardship and workplace
conflict. These experiences created a climate of suspicion and mutual
loathing between the two sides of industry. Even during the post-war
boom in the shipbuilding industry men were still kept on two hours'
notice. [141 ] Oliver Blanford, the managing director of Fairfields ship-
yard in the 1960s, commented that:

###### If you look at the areas of British industry where there is con-
flict, it is car-making, shipbuilding, and coal, and they are all
industries that fired their people every so often. If people have a
long history of casual employment they are not loyal and cannot
be expected to be loyal to their employer. [142 ]

Insecurity of employment also led to the development of a set of
mentalities which can loosely be described as egalitarian. It has been
noted that workers on Clydeside have been historically less interested
in the level of absolute wages and more in the proportion of wages
to profits. They have also been very concerned as to the distribution of
earnings between groups of workers, particularly as regards regional
equity. This, as Sydney Checkland remarked, meant that Glasgow
could offer 'no advantage in terms of labour costs upon which to
build new firms and jobs' .[143 ] A more recent study of one of the major
overseas employers in Scotland showed that, in spite of the manage-
ment dividing the labour force into permanent and temporary
workers, the core workers 'articulated a powerful litany of com-
plaints at the unfair way in which they saw the temps being treated
inside [the factory)'. For Alan McKinlay and Phil Taylor the 'evidence
amounted to an impressive reassertion of the collective consciousness
which can develop at the point of production amongst workers who
are contractually divided but whose shared work experience generates
precisely that consciousness' .[144 ]
The solidarities which emerged from these employment insecurities
were underscored by residential patterns. According to Robertson's
analysis of one Clydeside firm in the 1950s, one-third of the workers
lived 'on the job', and one-half lived close-by; only about one-third
lived on the opposite side of the river to that of their place of
employment. [145 ] Moreover, the prevalence of public sector housing

289

LABOUR, 194S-19 :J0s

and/or rent-controlled private accommodation, and the low levels of
owner occupation in Scotland provided a source of shared grievance
over housing conditions; while, at the same time, it afforded wide-
spread community support for those in conflict with employers or
the state. There were also fewer financial considerations to take on
board when deciding whether to opt for industrial action.
However, notions of equality were not only a response to tradi-
tional experiences of job insecurity, or the result of community solidar-
ities; they also owed something to the influence of socialist ideology.
Communist Party and other left-wing groups' infiltration of the official
labour movement after the Second World War did not meet with the
same level of hostility from trade unions as it had in the 1920s and
1930s. Abe Moffat became the first communist president of the
Scottish miners; Mick McGahey was an important figure in the NUM
during the national strikes of the 1970s and early 1980s; and Jimmy
Reid and James Airlie were prominent leaders of the famous UCS
work-in in 1973. Communist cadres were established in most indus-
trial concerns, even in American-owned companies, such as Timex,
in the decades after 1945. High infiltration levels were made possible
because the war and the economic boom which followed its end
strengthened shop steward power. Between 1947 and 1961 the den-
sity of shop stewards in British engineering increased by 50 per cent,
and in clockwork workplace organisation was said to have replaced
official unionism as the medium of worker/employer relations. 146
The foundation of the power of the shop stewards lay in the
wage/effort bargain and the complicated systems of wage calculation.
Even in dockwori< where national bargaining structures existed,
adjusting the complicated wage system of port transport, dealing
with manning levels, shift work arrangements and other employment
questions necessitated the erection of local bargaining structures
which unconsciously augmented the importance of shop stewards. 147
The leverage this gave to militants within the labour movement to
produce recurring conflicts with capital was extremely powerful and
led to the wave of strike actions in the 1960s and 1970s, which
affected many white-collar workers as well as those in manufacturing.
Even in American-owned plants in Scotland in the years 1960-69
there was a preponderance to strike 'which was markedly worse ...
than that of indigenous firms' .148

Employers reacted to the growth of shopfloor militancy by trying to
alter the nature of the bargaining process. Centralised bargaining with-
in the workplace, as advocated by the 1968 Donovan Commission,

290


-----

_Demise of Craft Unionism and Rise of White-Collar Unions_

was promoted and led to a fourfold expansion in the number of
personnel specialists in industry in the 1960s and 1970s and a spec-
tacular growth in the number of shop stewards. As part of this
process of formalisation of bargaining, the measured working day
was introduced in coalmining in 1965, and extended to other areas
of industry, such as car-making, in the period 1967 to 1972; and later,
in shipbuilding through the agreement between the nationalised British
Shipbuilders and the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering
Unions. Although opposed by key sections of the industrial workforce,
such as face workers in coalmining and boilermakers in shipbuild-
ing, [149 ] national wage agreements, by bolstering the leadership against
the rank-and-file, led to a marked reduction in the number of wildcat
strikes, which was exactly the intention of the Donovan Commission.
However, as Ashworth points out, in his study of the post-1945 coal
industry, although the national power loading agreement of 1965
led to greater uniformity of wages in the industry and reduced the
number of pit level strikes, it also ensured that when they occurred
in future 'strikes would be bigger'. Moreover, in industries where
formalisation of bargaining procedures had gone furthest, the record
in terms of strikes was far worse than in other industries in the
1970s. [150 ]

This is exactly what happened as government attempts at planning
the economy in the 1960s and the anti-inflationary strategies of the
state in the 1970s led to the use of incomes policies as substitutes for
free collective bargaining. Corporatist strategies had the effect of
politicising industrial relations in a way that led to recurring crises in
the state and the fall of the Heath government in 1975 and the Labour
government in 1979. Faced with overt challenges from rank-and-file
activists to incomes policies, the state attempted to shackle protest
through the introduction of anti-union legislation; a strategy which
only further politicised workers and raised the profile of the left-wing
of the labour movement. In 1969 a series of one-day national stop-
pages led to Labour's abandonment of plans to reform industrial
relations as encompassed in the policy document _In Place_ _of Strife_
(1968). Edward Heath's plans to do the same through the Industrial
Relations Bill also led to mass industrial action in the period 1970-71.
A decade of intermittent large-scale labour protest and internecine
industrial warfare culminated in the 'winter of discontent' of 1978-79
which saw the fall of the Callaghan government and the election of
the Conservatives later that year.
The new prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, and her close adviser,

291


-----

Sir Keith Joseph, concluded that the experience of the 1970s had
shown that the political cost of running the economy through incomes
policies was too high; they signally failed to deliver low inflation and
economic growth, and only embittered employer/employee relations.
An alternative strategy based on exposing the economy to the full
blast of market forces and pruning back government spending pro-
vided, it was thought, a surer means of bringing order to an anarchic
system of industrial relations. Feather-bedding subsidies to ailing
industrial giants, such as coal and steel, were to be phased out as part
of this general shake out of British industry. The Tories hoped that
this would induce a new sense of realism in industry and force trade
unions to accept the competitive rate for the job, rather than a rate
established through the use of their monopoly power - at a peak
in 1979. [151 ] Thus, the defeat of the trade unions was central to the
Thatcher government's anti-inflation strategy. Mass unemployment
and anti-union legislation were to be the chosen weapons in this
political struggle for sound money.
An impressive array of legislation aimed at crippling the effective-
ness of trade unions was passed between 1980 and 1984. The Employ-
ment Acts of 1980 and 1982 effectively ended the closed shop in all
firms where less than 80 per cent of the workforce favoured com-
pulsory union membership; secondary picketing and sympathy strikes
were outlawed; and the 1984 Trade Union Act provided for secret
ballots before industrial action and introduced a contracting-in system
of affiliation to the Labour Party. While the state was effectively
shackling the trade unions, market forces and falling government
expenditure were forcing up the level of unemployment. During the
period 1980-81 over a million jobs were lost in the manufacturing
industry in Britain. The impact of mass unemployment and government
legislation had the desired effect. In the years 1978-80 an average of
1874 000 working days were lost in Scotland through industrial dis-
putes; however, during the first half of 19 81 this had fallen to
240 000 per year. [152 ] In American plants based in Scotland four out of
five experienced no industrial stoppages in the period 1979-83, and
only 0.09 per cent of working days were lost in strike action in
1983. [153 ] In Britain as a whole the number of trade unionists fell
from 13m, or 54 per cent of the employed workforce, to 11m, or
46.7 per cent, in 1985, and to 42 per cent in 1992, while the pro-
portion of workplaces with recognised trade unions declined from 64
per cent in 1978 to 53 per cent in 1992. [154 ] This began a downward
trend until in 1997 the number of trade unionists in Britain was less
than 7m, with most of them located in the public sector.

292


-----

Government hostility towards trade unions and unemployment,
however, cannot solely account for the fall in membership and the
decline of labour militancy. Bill Jordan, president of the AEU, com-
mented in July 1987 that 'Most of the government's union legislation
has been ignored by a majority of employers' .[155 ] Therefore, other
factors have to be taken into account when trying to explain the
experience of the labour movement during the Thatcher years.
Changes in the labour market, which have led to a massive rise in the
number of part-time workers, who see trade unions as irrelevant to
their situation, have been perhaps more significant than legislation in
determining the level of membership. Also the invasion of Scottish
manufacturing industry by overseas firms has led to the formation of
a considerable number of non-union establishments, particularly in
the high-tech electronics sector, or single union agreements. Sproull
and Macinnes' survey of industrial relations in the Scottish electronics
industry in 1987 found that smaller, newly established plants and
those located in new towns were more likely to be anti-union than
those of greater longevity situated in urban conurbations. Overall,
two-thirds of electronics plants in Scotland did not recognise unions;
however, in small plants with less than fifty employees the figure
increased to one-in-ten, while in plants with 500 or more workers
seven out of ten firms afforded recognition. [156 ] This experience is
borne out by national studies. A survey carried out by Cranfield
Price Waterhouse in 1992 showed that seven out of ten employers
with over 200 employees continued to negotiate with unions, while
in small workplaces of less than 25 workers 'union recognition has
collapsed' .[157 ]
Location was also relevant to the question of union recognition.
John Leopold found that 90 per cent of firms in Cumbernauld and
East Kilbride had no non-manual employees in a union and nearly
two-thirds had no manual unionised employees. Where unions are
recognised 'this is, in most cases, on the basis of single union deals
only' .[158 ] Increasingly, the workers in the service sector and in 'Silicon
glen' electronics industries are becoming devoid of union representa-
tion. Identification with the firm is assiduously being cultivated
through various psychological screening programmes. One study of
the Nissan plant in the north east of England claimed that 'shopfloor
workers will [only] be appointed after rigorous testing, a part of which
will be to identify those unsuitable for employment because of their
trade union affiliations or sympathies' .[159 ] A similar procedure appears
to have been employed in Scotland at semi-conductor plants since
surveys in 1987 could find no evidence of union membership, and

293


-----

this was underscored by a more recent study of the electronics sector
which showed that employment growth was concentrated in the
non-union sector, thus, 'further diluting industry density levels' .[160 ]

While the growing number of non-union establishments allied to
the continued existence of high levels of unemployment has consid-
erably weakened the labour movement, its approach to industrial
relations has also fundamentally changed as the organised working
class has become increasingly to be found in white-collar occupations,
particularly in the state sector. The frequent clashes between white-
collar organisations and their employers throughout decades of the
1970s, 1980s and 1990s, tended to be located in the areas of educa-
tion and health. Although bitterly contested, these disputes did not
exhibit the same levels of conflict that were witnessed in, say, the
miners' strike of 1984, as the tactics and industrial strategy of the
white-collar unions have been qualitatively different from those
adopted by manual unions. Much of this can be put down to the fact
that they share membership of the union with those nominally in
superior positions, as well as to the high incidence of home ownership
among those in white-collar occupations. These factors provided
powerful restraints on industrial action which few manual workers
in Scotland have had to face. The last rearguard action by the old
working class, which demonstrated so effectively and vividly the
difference between manual and non-manual unions, was the afore-
mentioned bitter struggle of the miners in 1984. That dispute was to
prove the last dying scream of the old proletarian mentality. The defeat
of the miners cleared the way for a metamorphosis in trade union
organisation and in the conduct of strikes. As a result, manufacturing
industry is no longer the pre-eminent site of workplace conflict; more
and more it is the public sector, particularly in education, where the
arena of struggle is to be found. Indeed, of the amazingly low figure
of 425 800 working days lost in the UK as a result of industrial stop-
pages in 1996, 152 700, or 32 per cent, were lost in the education
sector alone. [161 ]
However, since the defeat of the miners in the 1984, few disputes
of any size or consequence have occurred in Britain, in spite of rising
frustration with wage settlements in the public sect01; whether among
blue- or white-collar workers. The acceptance of flexible labour
markets, with their chronic job insecurity and low wages, by the
present Labour government can only intensify these trends and
actively hamper the trade union movement in its efforts to recruit
new members in hitherto weakly organised sectors of the economy.

_Demise of Craft Unionism_ _and Rise of White-Collar Unions_

Therefore, in a relatively short space of time, the Scottish working
class went from being one of the most highly organised working
classes in the history of industrial capitalism, to a fragmented one as
yet barely able to defend its economic and political interests. This
was bound up with the collapse of the male, Protestant craft culture,
which although narrow and sectional, exhibited a highly developed
sense of solidarity and community. The newly dominant service sector
and white-collar unions, with their socially diverse working con-
stituencies, cannot hope to forge such intense solidarities among their
members; a situation which has obvious and important political con-
sequences. The concerns to which organised labour addressed itself
to in the immediate post-war decades were those bound up with
wealth redistribution and full employment. The gradual demise of
skilled workers since 1945 and their replacement by non-manual
labour poses several important questions: firstly, did the growth of
white-collar unionism change the social priorities of the labour
movement; secondly, has it led to a remaking of the Labour Party's
political ethos; and finally, has it radically redrawn the landscape of
political affiliations north of the border?

 LABOUR AND NATIONALISM:
 WORKING-CLASS POLITICS
 IN SCOTLAND, 1945-1990s

One of the historical ironies of the second half of the twentieth cen-
tury has been that as the working class in Scotland has fragmented
along occupational and cultural lines these divisions have had little
impact on electoral behaviour. Indeed, since 1929, when it won a
majority of Scottish parliamentary seats for the first time, Labour has
turned Scotland into fiefdom. On only three occasions, in 1931, 1935
and 1955, has the party failed to win a majority of seats in Scotland.
Indeed, in the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s the predisposition to
vote Labour led to the development of significant discontinuities
between the electoral behaviour of Scottish workers and those in the
rest of Britain. Until then the distribution of votes between the main
parties was consistent and in keeping with other parts of Britain; a
convergence of political allegiances which allowed political com-
mentators in the 1960s to claim that:

Today politics in the UK is greatly simplified by the absence of
major cleavages along the lines of ethnic groups, language or
religion .... The unimportance of these differences in politics is
demonstrated by the failure of the Scottish and Welsh nationalist
parties to secure representation in Parliament. [162 ]

However, from 1974 manual workers in Scotland increasingly showed
themselves to be out of step with their English counterparts as Table
30.1 shows.
The marked cleavage between Scottish and English workers' polit-
ical allegiances can partly be explained by reference to existing socio-
economic conditions. As we have seen, since the end of the Second

_Working-Class Politics in Scotland_

World War, Scotland, because of structural economic problems, has
become more dependent on the state than other parts of the UK, with
the exception of Northern Ireland. This has reflected itself in employ-
ment patterns and housing tenure, as well as in the large proportion
of the Scottish population living on state benefit. Thus, when the
Tories took office in 1979, committed to rolling back the frontiers of
the state and reducing public expenditure, it was to be expected that
their free market values would clash with the deeply entrenched
collectivism of Scottish society, which Labour had so assiduously cul-
tivated since its foundation.

However, it would appear that surveys into social attitudes in Scot-
land would show the Scottish workers to be no more concerned over
issues such as social welfare, unemployment and state intervention in
the economy, than workers south of the border. [163 ] The difference
between the two is essentially political, something which is rooted in
national perceptions of Conservatism. The more entrenched the Con-
servatives became in support of the Union, the more anti-European
they became, the more they were viewed in Scotland as the party of
English nationalism. It was interesting that the flag-waving patriotism
of the Falkland War in 1982 failed to provoke much more than a
lukewarm response in Scotland. [164 ] Thus, the divergence in voting pat-
terns is deeply related to the growth of a heightened sense of national
identity in Scotland. It is this phenomenon, rather than a greater
sense of class consciousness, which provides the key to understanding
the developments in working-class political culture in Scotland since
1945.
However, this was scarcely predictable in the decade following
the end of the Second World War. Labour won the 1945 election by
a landslide, although doing marginally less well in Scotland than in

England and Wales. [165 ] The economic and social policies of the new
government represented the climax of statist philosophies and the
triumph of British nationalism. Although the CPGB and left-wing
Labour activists worked with the SNP in the late 1930s and 1940s
to promote self-government for Scotland through the non-partisan
Scottish Convention movement, the leadership of the Labour Party
in Scotland, in the words of Arthur Woodburn, secretary of State for
Scotland in 1947, considered Home Rule as economically 'suici-
dal' . [166 ] In spite of this, the Convention collected two million signa-
tures for the National Covenant - a declaration in favour of Home
Rule - but the movement had petered out within a year with no tan-
gible results for its prodigious propaganda work. [167 ] It was described
as a 'Tory plot' by Woodburn and nationalist sentiments within the
labour movement were channelled by the leadership into Labour's
cosmetic 1948 White Paper on Scottish Affairs; something which sin-
gularly failed to capture the imagination of Scottish workers and
their families. [168 ]
Labour had declared itself a Unionist party and it was through the
agency of the British state, rather than a Scottish Assembly, that the
modernising of the socio-economic fabric of the country was to
occur. The demise of nationalist sentiments saw Scottish politics ossi-
fy into a largely phoney battle between two mainstream parties com-
mitted to the political consensus established in 1945. Although polit-
ical differences between Labour and the Conservatives over the wel-
fare state, nationalisation and full employment were minimal, the
symbolic potency of Unionism, Presbyterianism and Imperialism as
a means of mobilising working-class support provided a basis for the
latter's electoral triumphs in the 1950s. Even as late as 1968 a study
of the relationship between religion and voting behaviour in Dundee
showed that manual workers in the Church of Scotland voted 39.5
per cent for the Tories compared to only 6 per cent of Catholics in
that occupational group. Given that the 1950s witnessed a religious
revival, the identification of Presbyterianism with Conservatism was
all the stronger. This linkage proved too powerful for Labour in 1955
and even the working-class shipbuilding constituency of Govan,
Glasgow, fell to the Tories, although here the existence of a tradi-
tional working-class Orange vote was also important. The Tories
also won solidly Orange working-class wards in Glasgow such as
Kinning Park, Whiteinch, Partick and Govanhill. [169 ] The fact that
there were a series of colonial wars as well as the Suez crisis of 1956
heightened identification with the nation and the Empire and this

298


-----

_Working-Class Politics in Scotland_

served also to assist Tory political fortunes as the perceived party of
nation and Empire.
However, after the 1959 general election the working-class
Conservative vote in Scotland gradually evaporated as it did within
other social classes north of the border. The potency of political sym-
bols associated with Empire, Presbyterianism and Unionism failed to
resonate with working-class aspirations and interests. As the British
Empire disintegrated in the 1960s, and church-going and sectarianism
declined, Conservative values appeared to be out-of-step in the radical
1960s and early 1970s. They were depicted as reactionary and aimed
at addressing the concerns of a society which were rooted in past
struggles and which no longer had any relevance to contemporary
Scotland. These labels stuck and in the succeeding decades the intro-
duction of such unpopular measures as the Poll Tax and the wide-
spread dislike of Mrs Thatcher's style of political rhetoric brought
more misery for the Tories. Support declined with each successive
election until in the aftermath of the 1997 general election the Tories
controlled no local council in Scotland and had no Scottish MPs at
Westminster.
Although the weakening of the relationship of Presbyterianism
with Conservatism has been evident in recent decades, this is not to
say that religion has no impact on Scottish politics. Even within the
labour movement in Scotland sectarianism has occasionally reared its
head from time to time. The Monklands affair of the early 1990s, in
which Catholic Coatbridge was seen to be favoured at the expense of
Protestant Airdrie by the Labour-controlled district council, demon-
strated the continued sensitivity of this issue in Scottish politics.
Moreover, a study of the ideological orientations of Glasgow coun-
cillors in 1989 by Richard Levy and others showed that the deeper
the religious commitment, the greater was the likelihood that support
would be given to 'moderate' reformist political programmes; [170 ] a
phenomenon that Tom Bell noted in the late nineteenth century and
Tom Gallagher documented in the inter-war period. [171 ] There is also
evidence that working-class Catholics in Scotland are marginally
more likely to favour a Scottish parliament for Scotland than are
Protestants; while the heavily working-class membership of the Orange
Order in Scotland is predominantly Unionist and Conservative in
its voting behaviour. [172 ] But, in spite of these qualifications, with the
sharp decline in church-going, religion in Scotland nowadays plays
only a minimalist role in shaping electoral behaviour, or in influencing
policy at state or local level.

With the destruction among potential supporters of previously
strong ideological and religious barriers, Labour, enjoying mass sup-
port, began to reconstruct Scotland into a kind of political fiefdom.
However, it was a political project that was to prove incomplete as a
resurgent nationalism emerged in the 1960s capable of winning votes
from workers in the old and new industrial centres of Scotland. In
the 1959 general election the SNP polled only 0.8 per cent, or around
20 000, of the total Scottish votes cast; a figure in line with its show-
ing in 1931. However, by the 1966 general election its vote had
increased to 5 per cent, or 130 000, and a year later Winnie Ewing
won the Hamilton by-election - at that time, Labour's safest seat in
Scotland. By May 1968 Labour was facing a rout in local elections
when the SNP outpolled all the other parties with 34 per cent of the
vote. Unthinkably, Labour lost control of Glasgow to the Progressives
and the Conservatives, who formed a minority administration with
SNP support. [173 ] The Labour vote in municipal elections in Glasgow
had fallen by 52 018, or 43 per cent, in the years 1960-68, while the
SNP had seen its share of the poll increase by 93 393, or by over
3000 per cent. Although Labour recaptured Hamilton in the 1970
general election, SNP support grew to 11 per cent of the total elec-
torate and the Western Isles were won. Organisation was also
improved with constituency parties established in all of Scotland's 71
parliamentary divisions. By 197 5 the SNP had 4 7 5 branches, 17 5
more than Labour in Scotland. [174 ] In the general election of October
1974 SNP parliamentary representation increased to eleven, and two
years later Labour lost 131 seats in the municipal elections, 98 of
them to the nationalists. [175 ] Moreover, many Labour activists had left
the party in late 1975 to join two dissident MPs- Jim Sillars and
John Robertson- in forming the Scottish Labour Party (SLP).

Although the SLP failed to make any electoral headway and soon
collapsed after prolonged bouts of internal wrangling, the split was
highly damaging to morale and organisation in the Labour Party. [176 ]

The SLP was, in part, born out of the growing frustration of
activists with the machine politics of Labour in Scotland in the post-
1945 era. The departure of the ILP in the 1930s, had, as we have
seen, left a yawning gap between Labour's professed idealism and its
political practice. That idealism, however, was reborn in the electoral
victory in 1945 and was reflected in the increasing individual mem-
bership of the party, which had risen from 17 211 in 1943 to 24 670,
or by just over 30 per cent, in 1944. [177 ] Mass membership campaigns
were launched in the early 1950s and the Glasgow City Labour Party

300


-----

_Working-Class Politics in Scotland_

aimed at recruiting 15 000 new members. [178 ] However, once it was
realised that the new members might upset the traditional balance
of power in the CLPs, the idea of building a mass party of political
idealists was abandoned in favour of a party controlled by a small
caucus of trade unionists and bureaucrats. With an annual income of
just £760 in 1962 and only five full-time agents paid by Transport
House, compared to 55 for the Conservative and Unionist Party,
there was little that the Scottish Council of the Labour Party (SCLP)
could do in any case to build a mass party. As a result, party mem-
bership in Scotland in the years 1951-64 was never higher than 8 per
cent of the total for Britain, and in comparison to Scotland's share
of British population and MPs was in an embarrassing deficit. [179 ]
The 1950s and 1960s in Scotland witnessed the haemorrhage of
branch activity and radicalism. The former 'wild men' of the Clyde,
due to their valuable contribution to the war effort, were showered
with awards and honours from a grateful establishment. Patrick
Dollan accepted a knighthood in 1941; David Kirkwood became the
first Baron of Bearsden ten years later; honorary doctorates and
other titles were bestowed on Tom Johnston; and William Elger
became Deputy Lieutenant of the County of the City of Glasgow in
February 1945. [180 ]The embrace snuffed out any challenge to the status
quo. Even left-wing MPs such as John McGovern, Labour MP for
Shettleston, lost their enthusiasm for radical social change. In 1930
he had attempted to make the oath of the allegiance to the Crown
optional, and as late as 1948 had objected to a proposal to place the
Duke of Edinburgh on the civil list; however, in the 1950s McGovern
became a warm supporter of the monarchy. At a Columbia University
dinner in the Waldorf Astoria, New York, on 30 November 1954 he
cheered the 'Queen Mother heartily' . [181 ] Along with Lady Agnes
Dollan, McGovern joined the right-wing Moral Rearmament Move-
ment of Frank Buckman to fight against 'godless Communism' .[182 ]
The situation was no more inspiring at the grassroots level. Jimmy
Allison recalled that his application to join the Labour Party in 1959
took two years to process, adding that this was not simply adminis-
trative incompetence, but was part of:

a deliberate policy of people being kept out in case they upset
the balance of power within the local constituency. There was at
least one example of applicants being told that the local party
was 'full up'. [183 ]

301


-----

Moreover, the youthful enthusiasm of Allison was almost immediately
snuffed out by the general ideological ennui of practical socialism. At
his first meeting of the ward party in Paisley, Allison said only 'eight
people [were] in the room, including three Labour councillors ... we
spent our time talking about trivial matters such as street lighting
and the state of the pavements'. [184 ] This only mirrored the Scottish
party whose annual conference was restricted to discussing purely
matters relating to Scotland. As Frances Wood points out, restriction
led to a preoccupation with 'the Scottish economy, housing and edu-
cation', which is probably why in the 1950s and 1960s, fearing they
might die from boredom, Labour leaders avoided the SCLP's annual
conference. [185 ]
Allison's experiences and those of delegates to party conferences
are borne out by the history of particular CLPs. Glasgow Maryhill
CLP in 1953 had a membership of 2071; two years later this had
fallen to 1259, or by 37.5 per cent. At ward level the situation was
even more disastrous with average attendance at meetings of only 24;
a figure which was recognised by the secretary as being 'too low to
provide the nucleus of active members required to keep the party in
good working order' .[186 ] The Govan CLP had only 79 members in
1962; the Gorbals CLP had no idea of its 'actual membership'. [187 ]The
poor showing of the party in Glasgow in the 1968 municipal elec-
tions, however, provides the best insight into the decline of activism
in Labour's Scottish stronghold. An internal enquiry into party
organisation in the city showed that the total individual membership
of the fifteen Glasgow CLPs was a mere 1786. Nine CLPs had less
than 100 members and of these six had less than 50; only one con-
stituency - Pollok - had over 300 members. The organisation of the
Glasgow Labour Party was described as 'deplorable'. Such was the
disregard for recruiting new, especially young, members that there
were only three branches of Labour Young Socialists in Glasgow-
at a time when young people were in revolt against what they saw
as an outdated and reactionary political system. [188 ] Organisational
disarray was equalled by the political arrogance shown towards
traditional working-class Labour supporters by the party leadership.
Jimmy Allison wrote of his incredulity, when running his first elec-
tion campaign in Paisley's FoxBar and Ferguslie Park wards in 1967,
that the 'Labour councillors who held the seats never canvassed' .[189 ]
In spite of a number of internal enquiries, throughout the 1970s
party organisation and morale remained in the same chaotic state as
they had been in the 1950s and 1960s. Fred Underhill, secretary of
the Labour Party, wrote to Jimmy Allison, complaining about the fact

302


-----

that in eight of the fifteen Glasgow CLPs 'membership ... remains
disgraceful'. He added that 'For Labour held seats at this vital stage
of affairs to have only around 100 members is shocking'. [190 ] The sec-
retary of the Labour Party in Scotland, Helen Liddle, highlighted that
'Party activists lacked the motivation to go out and work' during the
1980 European elections, and that the campaign 'was worse than the

[1979] general election'. [191 ] The situation was no better in other parts
of Scotland; indeed, in some places the level of working-class partici-
pation was even lower than in Glasgow. Aberdeen, for example, in
the early 1970s had only 200 members: the lowest ratio of party
members to voters in Scotland.
###### J. P. MacKintosh, analysing the condition of Labour in Scotland in
the mid-1970s, found himself confronted by a political party which
was not only failing to address the concerns of the new constituencies
which were emerging as a result of economic change, but also one in
which activists and leaders alike were locked in a time warp regarding
social attitudes:

The dependence on the Clydesdale horse has given the Labour
Party an increasingly old-fashioned image at a time when afflu-
ence has tended (especially in the more prosperous east of
Scotland) to blur class images a little. This, and the long-standing
opposition of the Labour leadership in Scotland to such liberal
causes as divorce law reform, reform of the licensing laws and
free contraceptive aids on the Health Service, meant that the
party had little appeal to other sections of the community, to the
young or to the progressive elements in the professions. Even the
massive patronage of the Secretary of State was not used to
appoint lively people. As a result, the Labour Party in Scotland
has aged and lost dynamism. Its one absorbing interest has been
jobs (saving rather than creating jobs) and capital projects such
as schools and houses. But the original idealistic vision of a kind
of society socialists wanted, of the point of building schools and
houses, tended to fade out and now the social purpose of the
party is far from clear. [192 ]

From MacKintosh's perceptive analysis, it is hardly surprising that as
Labour was organised round a set of out-of-date traditional mascu-
line definitions of the working-class's political interests, the party,
especially in Scotland, it would fail to embrace the gender and race
politics of the 1970s and early 1980s. Women remained fundamen-
tally unrepresented on the Scottish Executive of the Labour Party; as

303


-----

parliamentary and municipal candidates; and as delegates to annual
conference. At the Annual Conference of Labour Women (ACWL)
in 1967 a veteran party member said that Labour 'was the most
masculine dominated and masculine orientated party she had ever
encountered'. Indeed, such was the marginalisation of women's issues
in the Labour Party that its own newspaper - Daily _Herald-_
neglected to report the proceedings of the ACLW. [193 ]
Incredibly, and in spite of the growing women's movement of the
1970s and the changing gendering of employment, in 1978 the
Scottish party voted to abolish the women's seats on the Executive.
The basis for this action was that the Equal Pay and Sex Discrimi-
nation Acts had delivered female equality and positive discrimination
in favour of women was viewed as 'an insult to women's personal
abilities'. [194 ] In spite of being supported by leading female members
in the Labour Party in Scotland, the decision taken in 1978 did not
lead to an increased presence of women on the Scottish party's exec-
utive committee; it remained at three. Moreover, the Scottish Women's
Committee was a paper organisation dependent on press-ganging
women to serve on it; an unsurprising action given that in 1981 there
were only thirteen women's sections in the whole of Scotland. The
party's record in terms of selecting women as parliamentary candi-
dates was equally unimpressive. From a high of eight female PPCs in
1955 the number fell to three in 1970, where it roughly stayed, with
the exception of October 1974, until the 1990s, when six women
were selected as PPCs - the worst for any Labour region, with the
exception of Wales and the north of England. Over the period 1955
to 1992 only twenty Labour parliamentary seats have been won by
women. As late as 1987 there was only one female Labour MP in
Scotland. Moreover, things were little better at municipal level. A
survey of 54 Glasgow Labour councillors in the late 1980s showed
that 89 per cent of them were male and middle aged. [195 ]
###### It was female activists who acted decisively to empower both
individual women and women's organisation in the Labour Party, in
spite of the indifference of the leadership. The Scottish Women's
Action Committee (SWAC), set up as an offshoot of the Bennite
Labour Co-ordinating Committee, persuaded delegates to reverse the
1978 decision at the 1984 Scottish Conference, and, as a result, for
the first time in the history of the [Labour] Party in Britain, two of
those seats were elected by women delegates at the Scottish Women's
Conference. [196 ] The conference success, however, was a reflection of
grassroots activity. The proselytising efforts of SWAC had seen the
number of Women's Sections grow to 56 and achieve parity with

304


-----

men in the constituency section of the Scottish party. In 1993 the
Scottish Labour Women's Caucus was established to improve the
representation of women at all levels **in** the party. This action mir-
rored the activities of women in the trade union movement. As the
number of male jobs have declined, the unions have had to focus on
recruiting female members. In response to the changing gender bias
of the labour movement the STUC initiated plans in 1994 to have
equal gender representation on the General Council. [197 ]Similarly, due
to pressure from female activists, and the fact that more women voted
for Labour in the 1992 general election than men, the Labour Party
in Scotland had to agree to all-women short lists in vacant winnable
parliamentary seats to overcome the gender deficit. However, as Alice
Brown points out, **it** will be 'some time before women in the party
gain equality with men in terms of being Westminster Parliamen-
tarians', as Labour's electoral hegemony has meant that there is a
'slow rate of turnover of available seats' .[198 ] A proposal to establish
all-female short lists in every vacant seat in Scotland was defeated at
Scottish Labour's conference in 1994. Thus, in spite of the male
rhetoric of equality, women in the Labour Party continue to feel that
these 'principles were not always practiced in the party' .[199 ]
The ossification of Labour in Scotland both politically and ideo-
logically, and the alienation of women and the young, particularly in
forty year period after defeat in the 1951 general election, made it
extremely vulnerable to the fallout from a radical resurgence of
nationalist sentiments in the 1970s. However, in spite of its organi-
sational failings, the 1980s and 1990s have seen Labour rebuff,
although not entirely douse political challenge posed by a resurgent
nationalism. The referendum of 1979 on Scottish devolution saw only
32.9 per cent of the electorate north of the border favour a 'Yes' vote,
although supported by the Labour leadership. A general election
quickly followed in which the SNP lost most of the ground **it** had
gained in 1974. Failure led the left-wing of the SNP to articulate a
need for the party to cast off its 'Tartan Tory' image and to focus its
political energies on winning over Scottish workers to the nationalist
cause. This meant contesting with Labour in the latter's backyard -
central Scotland.
Alice Brown, et al., have shown this strategy to have met with some
political success. In the 1960s and 1970s the typical nationalist voter
was exhibiting no strong sense of class loyalty. It was the party of the
young, the unpwardly mobile and those living in new towns; indeed,
those outside the socialising experience provided by the industrial
communities of central Scotland. [200 ] However, an analysis profiling

305


-----

the social composition of the 'Yes' vote in the 1979 referendum on a
Scottish Assembly showed that 'support for the Assembly was heav-
iest among Labour and SNP voters, younger voters and the working
class'. [201 ] The class nature of support for devolution provided a solid
basis for the political strategy of the SNP and by the early 1990s the
party had secured the votes of 26 per cent of the Scottish working
class, but only 21 per cent of middle-class voters. The SNP vote in
1992 was 55 per cent working class compared to Labour's 62 per
cent. [202 ] In the 1980s the SNP's stand on issues such as nuclear disar-
mament, the poll tax, put it to the left of Labour and undoubtedly
some workers came to see the former as more representative of tra-
ditional Labour values and voted accordingly. Indeed, while Labour
was disowning its history, the nationalists were using the historic
symbols of popular struggle in Scotland, such as 'Red Clydeside', to
mobilise the Scots towards a radical nationalism. [203 ]
The strength of national identity as well as the substantial and
continuing support for the SNP forced the new Labour government
of Tony Blair to cede to Scotland a measure of Home Rule. The
referendum which took place in 1997 overwhelmingly endorsed the
growing nationalist aspirations of the Scottish people. Whether this
means there will be a similar ringing endorsement for the social and
economic policies of New Labour only time will tell. However, if the
past is anything to go by party managers cannot afford to be over-
confident; historically, Scottish workers may not have been on the
whole revolutionary, but they have always been radical in their
demands for democracy, fairness and social justice. The shift from
industry to the services seems in no way to have diminished the
resonance of these values for the Scottish workers, although they
have been tempered by the growth of materialism.
The post-1945 decades have borne witness to a complete transfor-
mation in the economic, social and political landscape of Scotland.
These changes have encompassed the destruction of the once all-
powerful sectarian masculine culture of the skilled worker and its
replacement by a workplace culture which is, on one level, more
democratic, less misogynist and anti-Catholic, and, on an another,
less cohesive and disciplined. In spite of its weaknesses and flaws, the
older workplace culture was capable of mobilising workers around
commonly agreed interests and values, which had they been absent
may have brutalised workers and their families to a greater extent
than that to which their suffering and hardship over the last two
hundred years bear eloquent testimony to. However, the labourism
that the skilled man's cultural hegemony gave rise to in Scotland

306


-----

froze out consideration of other levels of experience of family, gender
and sexuality, as the world of work was afforded primacy of concern.
The changes in the labour process, deindustrialisation and the growth
of the branch plant economy in general, have altered these percep-
tions. A deskilled working-class has found itself unable to challenge
the appropriation by capital of its working space and time to any-
thing like the extent of its industrial forbears. This has reflected itself
in the decline of trade unionism and the powerlessness of the labour
movement to arrest the spiralling unemployment of the last few
decades, or defend the social wage. The use of parliamentary legisla-
tion and the law courts by the state and hostile employers have effec-
tively ended the closed shop, the sympathetic strike, mass picketing,
and made other aspects of the mentality of collectivism redundant.
Industrial conflict is more likely to be found in the public sector,
where high concentrations of organised white- and blue-collared
workers remain, rather than in the increasingly unorganised private
sector.
Although politically this fragmentation has yet to impact itself on
traditional voting patterns, it is interesting to note that nationalist
support is strongest in those sectors of production in the Scottish
economy which are the most dynamic - electronics and light engi-
neering- and in the new towns where these industries are located.
Labour's vote among workers has been largely confined to manual
workers, council tenants and the substantial section of Scottish society
reliant on state benefits or employment. To capture the more socially
mobile and those with real disposable income Labour has had to
fashion a politics of consumption. As a result, the traditional work-
ing-class voter increasingly finds his/her values and traditions at
odds with the social market ethos of New Labour. The alienation of
old Labour may yet come back to haunt the new party in the years
to come, particularly in a Scottish parliament elected on proportional
representation, and provide the basis for a realignment on the left of
the political spectrum, perhaps rallying around a radical nationalist
agenda. In spite of profound economic and social restructuring, the
core values of democracy, fairness and social justice which have
dominated working-class political culture since the late eighteenth
century still remain potent symbols on which to establish and fashion
a political constituency. This is what was at the heart of the rejection
of free market Conservatism in Scotland throughout the 1980s and
the 1990s and it is these values, regardless of which party is in power,
which will endure into the new millennium.
