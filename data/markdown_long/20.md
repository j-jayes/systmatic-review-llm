This book examines the development of employers' human resource
management and industrial relations policies in Britain. It adopts a broad
historical perspective, beginning with the inheritance from the nineteenth
century and coming up to date with modern human resource management
policies. It focuses on how managers organise the employment relation-
ship, how they control work relations, and how they deal with trade
unions and industrial relations. The author examines these in the context
of the market within which the firm operates, and the strategy, structure,
and hierarchy of the modern industrial enterprise, developing a theoreti-
cal approach which emphasises the effect of these factors on management
choices.
The book shows that historically British employers tended to adopt
market based strategies rather than internal ones. Despite a post-war
trend towards 'internalisation', comparison with the US, Germany and
Japan reveals that this has come about only slowly and unevenly, and
has not been able to reverse the relative decline in economic performance
and national competitiveness.

### Preface

This book is the outcome of many years' research and writing on the
management of labour. Its origins go back to a doctoral dissertation at
the London School of Economics on the role of employers' associations
in the development of the British system of industrial relations. Sub-
sequently over the years I sustained my interest in the central role of
management in industrial relations and carried out further research on
wider aspects of labour management in various industries and individual
companies. The book provides a synthesis of my work and that of others
in the area. I hope also that it makes new contributions in terms of
concepts, knowledge, and interpretations.
Inevitably over the years I have accumulated a considerable debt of
gratitude to various academic colleagues. B. C. Roberts and H. A. Clegg
encouraged my original interest in the role of employers and my belief
that they are the prime movers in industrial relations. Colleagues at the
University of Kent have commented on various drafts of the manuscript
and I would like in particular to thank J. Lovell, S. Glynn, J. Oxborrow,
G. Crompton, and G. Rubin. Colleagues at the London School of
Economics have also commented over the years and here I am particularly
grateful to L. Hannah, T. Gourvish, S. Keeble, D. Baines, E. Hunt, R.
Fitzgerald, and J. Tomlinson. Many others have helped with suggestions
for improvement on specific themes and chapters. I have received assist-
ance from economic and business historians who have corrected many
of my historical errors and misunderstandings - G. Jones, J. Zeitlin, S.
Tolliday, J. Melling, A. Reid, N. Whiteside, P. Thane, A. Mclvor, R.
Coopey, L. Holden, and A. McKinlay. Since this is also a study which
comes more or less up to date, I have also benefited from discussions
with industrial relations, labour economics, and business colleagues who
have provided useful critical comments on more contemporary chapters -
K. Sissons, R. Martin, P. Marginson, P. Anthony, A. Pendelton, O. Clarke,
F. Bayliss, M. Rawlinson, A. Starkman, and P. Ryan. With such a long
series of acknowledgements, it is clear that the usual disclaimers apply.
I would also like to thank the various employers' organisations and

companies who allowed me access to their records and who provided
interviews. These are referred to individually in the notes. In addition,
I would like to thank the Economic and Social Research Council and
the Nuffield Foundation for financial assistance with some of the research
which went into the making of the volume. Finally, I owe a special debt
of gratitude to Cathy, without whose support and encouragement this
book would not have been possible.
For many years in Britain, perhaps more than in other major industrial
countries, labour has been treated primarily as a commodity subject to
market forces. At the present time there is much talk about the develop-
ment of a new approach to the management of human resources. I hope
that the conceptual and historical perspective of this book will enable
the management of labour to be seen as part of a more complex evolution
and will illustrate the constraints and opportunities which we inherit
from the past.

## Introduction: the management of labour

The management of people at work has always been a central problem
and challenge for employers. It is a universal problem, but it has been
tackled in different ways, at different times, in different countries. As the
first industrial nation, Britain occupies a distinctive position with a long
legacy of traditions and practices which still influence the way labour is
managed in the modern business enterprise. The management, and mis-
management, of labour has had profound consequences for British
society and national competitiveness.
This book investigates the development of labour management in
Britain. It begins with the inheritance from the nineteenth century and
traces continuities and change in the twentieth-century business enter-
prise. It concentrates mainly on the management of manual workers in
industrial enterprises since it was here that the historically predominant
pattern of labour management was established. A major theme is that,
at an early stage during the process of industrialisation, British employers
made certain critical choices about the ways in which labour should be
managed. Though at the time these choices had a certain rationality, in
the longer term they proved short-sighted and less appropriate. Yet they
set a pattern which persisted and profoundly influenced the management
of labour in the twentieth-century business enterprise. It is the argument
of this book that the outcome of these choices contributed significantly
to Britain's relatively poor economic performance from the late nine-
teenth century onwards.
The book seeks to bridge the gap between traditional business history
and labour history. In addition it draws upon contemporary studies of
business management, industrial relations, and personnel management.
From the Webbs onwards, we have a number of excellent studies of
British labour history, which provide valuable insights into labour
management, though their main focus has been on trade unions.[1] In
recent years there has been a growth of business history, including studies
of individual firms and broader surveys. However, these various bodies
of literature have not been brought together. What follows draws on

2 Markets, firms, and the management of labour

earlier historical studies of labour management,[2] but it differs from
previous work in several respects. It takes a longer term perspective,
beginning in the late nineteenth century and coming more or less up-to-
date. It therefore builds a bridge between historical and contemporary
studies. It also sets the story in a wider economic and business context,
bringing out the importance of market structure and company organisa-
tion. In addition, it adopts a broad view of labour decisions and interac-
tions between employers and their workers, by looking beyond narrow
aspects of personnel management and management-union relations.

**Concepts and definitions**

In analysing economic processes economists use the notions of markets
and firms. A market exists when there is an exchange of goods or services
between sellers and buyers, shaped by the forces of supply and demand
and co-ordinated by the price mechanism. Such an exchange is usually
a short-term and relatively impersonal transaction. Firms, on the other
hand, are economic institutions which operate in markets, but which are
distinct from them. Activities within~Â£rms, above a certain size, are
co-ordinated and controlled by a hierarchy of managers, and relations
within the firm are more likely to be longer term. One way to see the
firm is as an administrative mechanism which comes into being and
supersedes the market mechanism when it becomes more efficient or
more effective to co-ordinate activities and allocate resources internally
within the firm rather than externally in the market.[3]

Labour is one of the primary factors of production and represents
both a cost and a resource to the firm. Whether the employer sees labour
primarily as a cost to be minimised or as a resource to be developed is
of considerable importance to the practice of labour management because
it shapes the attitudes and practices of employers. In either case, however,
it should be stressed from the outset that labour is very different from
non-human factors of production, a fact noted by economists of very
different persuasions. Thus Marx made the distinction between labour
power and labour: what the employer buys in the labour market is labour
power or, in other words, the potential and capacity to work; but the
employer's continuing problem is how to get actual labour or effort out
of the worker in the workplace.[4] From a different standpoint, Marshall
made a similar point. For him the uniqueness of labour was that 'human
agents of production are not bought or sold as machinery and other
material agents of production are. The worker sells his work, but he
himself remains his own property.'[5] Similarly, the American institutional-


-----

The management of labour 3

ist economist, Commons, placed great emphasis on the provisional and
open-ended nature of the transactions surrounding labour. 'The labour
contract is not a contract', he wrote, 'it is a continuing implied renewal
of contracts at every minute and hour, based on the continuance of what
is deemed, on the employer's side, to be satisfactory service, and, on the
worker's side, what is deemed to be satisfactory conditions and compensa-
tion.'[6] Labour is, therefore, more than a commodity which can be bought
and sold: employees are a resource which must be controlled and moti-
vated in order to secure productive output.
In this study, labour or human resource management is used as a
generic term to cover the set of decisions which employers have long
made in order to govern their enterprises. It is taken to cover three main
areas - work relations, employment relations, and industrial relations.
Work relations covers the way work is organised and the deployment of
workers around technologies and production processes. Employment
relations deals with the arrangements governing such aspects of employ-
ment as recruitment, training, job tenure and promotion, and the reward
of workers. Industrial relations is concerned with the representational
systems which may exist within an enterprise: in the British context this
has often meant management-union relations and the process of collec-
tive bargaining. These are obviously rather arbitrary distinctions of con-
venience and, in practice, there is considerable overlap between them.
For the purposes of this book, however, the distinction is used to provide
a framework for focusing on and analysing key employer decisions.
The approach adopted sees labour management in a broad context. It
places considerable emphasis on the markets within which firms operate,
both labour markets and also final product markets. Markets simul-
taneously represent an opportunity, a constraint, and a threat to
employers. In other words, they can provide either an incentive or a
disincentive to particular labour strategies. The approach also focuses
on the organisational context of the firm, especially its strategy and
structure. Strategy is used, in the first place, in the sense now established
in the business administration, industrial economics, and business history
literature to mean overall market strategies of growth, backward and
forward integration, specialisation and diversification. Structure refers
to the organisational forms and managerial hierarchies which firms
develop to manage their activities. These can either facilitate or impede
the choice and development of particular strategies. In this book,
however, the terms strategy and structure are further developed and
applied to the management of labour. In this context, strategies are
defined as the long-term actions and policies used by management to
secure a satisfactory labour force, to organise, discipline, and reward

workers, and to deal with workers' representational and collective aspir-
ations. Structures are the organisational forms and hierarchical arrange-
ments used to administer such labour policies.

**Theoretical framework**

The book owes its theoretical ideas and origins to a number of sources.
First and foremost, it owes a debt to the institutional tradition in
economics. This is an approach which stresses the importance of organisa-
tional arrangements and transactions within markets. Writing at the
beginning of this century, Commons argued that the basic unit of
economic analysis should not be commodities or factors of production,
but transactions, in other words, the arrangements through which goods
and services are exchanged. He pointed out that there are a variety of
institutional forms, such as markets, firms, and cartels, which may co-
ordinate exchanges between individuals or groups. In his writings he
developed an argument on the following lines: in a market economy, the
scope of the market, its geographical extent, and the degree of competition
within the market are key factors which influence transactional arrange-
ments; such arrangements shape the structure or organisation of the firm;
different firm structures, he argued, then influence the pattern of labour
management and aspects such as union organisation; changes in the
market, in particular its 'ever-widening area' and 'increased competitive
menace', trigger changes in strategies and organisational forms. For
Commons, the analysis of different institutional forms and patterns in
various market contexts was central to the study of economic processes
in history.[7]

An important contribution to the economist's theory of the firm and
one which can be applied to the firm's labour activities is to be found
in the classic work by Coase on 'The Nature of the Firm'.[8] In this, Coase
discussed why firms come into existence and why they grow. In a sense,
he was concerned with the boundaries of the firm, with what the firm
itself undertakes and what it leaves to individuals, other firms, and other
institutions. Coase suggested that the boundary between the market and
the firm, between the external price mechanism and the internal
administrative mechanism, is determined by the relative transaction cost
of each. Such transaction costs include inter alia the costs of dealing
with uncertainty, gaining information, and making and enforcing con-
tracts. Where the costs of using the external market mechanism are
relatively low, the firm will choose to transact through the market; where
the costs of market transactions are too high, the firm will prefer to


-----

internalise activities within its boundaries; the limits to the growth of
the firm will be fixed by the volume of transactions which can be efficiently
internalised. Following Coase, others have identified more complex trans-
actional arrangements than the simple dichotomy between market and
firm. In practice, there exists a spectrum of contractual arrangements,
including markets, firms, and various forms of inter-firm organisation
such as cartels, joint ventures, and subcontracting.[9] Other economists,
such as Williamson, working in the institutional tradition, have tried to
identify different types of structural arrangements within firms and to
explain why they exist and with what economic consequences.[10]

Similar ideas have been developed independently in empirical research
by business historians. In the US, Chandler has analysed the growth of
the modern business enterprise in terms of decisions to internalise certain
historically separable business activities.[11] The process of internalisation,
he has argued, began when mass markets and mass-production tech-
nologies permitted high volume throughput in production and distribu-
tion. Firms grew by increasing the scale of their production or the scope
of their products and by adding new plants. Firms also grew in a
horizontal direction by acquiring other firms in the same industry; they
grew vertically by obtaining related processes involved in earlier or later
stages of production; and they also internalised by developing purchas-
ing, sales, and other functions which they had previously left to others
such as suppliers or merchants. In these ways the small, single-plant,
single-product firm (the S-form firm, to use Williamson's terminology[12])
was transformed into the large, multi-unit, multi-product enterprise.
These strategies of growth then induced a search for new structural forms
of organisation. Over time, firms have moved through various stages. At
an early stage, some developed unified structures, with functionally
specialised departments in large headquarters (the U-form firm). Others,
usually growing by acquisition and merger, remained decentralised feder-
ations of relatively autonomous, but legally related, units and adopted
looser holding-company forms of organisation (H-form). Increasingly,
in particular as a result of product and geographical diversification, firms
have moved more towards a multidivisional form of organisation (M-
form), where operations are divided into product or geographical
divisions, but subject to the overall strategic control of headquarters. For
Britain, Chandler, Hannah, and others have used a similar type of analysis
to examine the growth of the modern business corporation. They have
shown, however, that the process of internalisation and organisational
development occurred later in Britain. Smaller firms survived for longer,
and there was less pressure on larger firms to develop new forms of
organisation. Cultural and social factors, such as the strength of family

ownership, may in part explain the differences between the US and
Britain. But business historians have tended to emphasise the different
nature of factor and final product markets in Britain. More concentrated
markets and efficient distribution systems obviated the need, in the case
of Britain, to bypass the market and build large centralised firms with
extensive managerial hierarchies.[13]

The argument of this book is that these ideas can be developed and
used to understand the nature of labour management. At this point it is
useful to present certain key propositions. Such a presentation of general-
isations risks oversimplifying a set of complex economic and organisa-
tional interactions and understating certain factors. However, this
framework is set out as a pre-statement of the general thesis to be
developed in the course of the book and to help make sense of the
detailed historical material which follows.[14]

The initial proposition is simply that, in a market economy, the nature
of markets will play a large part in shaping labour decisions. In a sense,
to say that markets are important in a capitalist economy is to state the
obvious; but the nature of markets, for the various factors of production
and for the final product or service, is so fundamental that it can be
stated as a proposition. Important features of markets which will be
stressed are their size and boundaries, their homogeneity or fragmenta-
tion, their stability or instability, and the degree of competition within
them. The argument is developed in the book that the nature of product
markets in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, in particular
their heterogeneity and degree of fragmentation, had a profound effect
on systems of labour management in Britain. The extension of product
markets and the intensification of competitive pressures at various times
triggered significant changes in labour management arrangements.
Labour markets also shaped employer decisions in various ways. To cite
but one: the relative abundance of labour, including craft labour, in
nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Britain played an important part
in shaping employer policies and practices. In particular, it was a disin-
centive to the introduction of more sophisticated production techniques
and the development of strong internal employment systems.
Of course, markets exist within and are shaped by historical, cultural,
and political contexts. To say that markets have been of crucial import-
ance is not to deny the significance of other environmental factors.
Employers obviously made their choices in a social and cultural context
where historical traditions and attitudes were important. Indeed, in
accounting for employers' behaviour, this book places considerable
emphasis on the origins and early development of systems of labour
management in Britain and the continuities in attitudes and practices.

The management of labour 7

In addition, the activities of the state shaped events, both by direct
government intervention in labour management as through legislation
and more indirectly by influencing the market context. Similarly, in the
industrial relations sphere, workers and their trade unions have been a
significant factor independently influencing relations with employers.
However, in a market economy, where some kind of profit maximisation
and cost containment are goals, the forces of competition and the nature
of markets are of major importance in shaping strategic choices. In other
words, markets do not determine behaviour, but are a powerful constraint
on choices.
The second proposition is that market forces are mediated through
the structure of the firm. In other words, the organisation of the firm
itself is of crucial importance in shaping labour decisions. It is significant
that the modern business enterprise in Britain developed more slowly
than in some other countries. The traditional British enterprise, smaller
and often family-owned and -managed, remained the predominant form
well into the twentieth century in many industries. Where large firms
emerged, they were often loosely organised holding companies in which
subsidiaries enjoyed considerable autonomy. The predominance of small
firms or loosely co-ordinated larger firms shaped the choices open to
British employers for managing labour. Thus choices of strategy and
structure at the broader level of the firm both constrain and facilitate the
choice of strategy and structure in the area of labour management.
A third proposition is that the nature of the managerial hierarchy is
an important variable influencing labour decisions. The managerial
hierarchy is made up both of vertical levels (top, middle, and lower
managers) and horizontal functions (such as production, finance, sales,
and personnel). The effectiveness of managerial hierarchies depends on
various characteristics. It depends on the technical training and pro-
fessional competence of managers. It also depends on the degree of
integration or segmentation within the managerial hierarchy between
levels and functions. Managers who are better trained and managerial
hierarchies which are more integrated are more likely to be better able
to manage. It is noted in this book that in Britain family control and
management remained stronger and salaried management developed
more slowly than in other countries. Also, British management has tended
to be relatively less well trained and proficient than in certain other major
countries and managerial hierarchies tended to be more segmented. Weak
managerial hierarchies, allied with inadequate corporate structures,
meant that there was insufficient organisational capability in most British
firms to develop and administer strong internal systems of labour
management.[15]


-----

8 Markets, firms, and the management of labour

A fourth proposition is that the choice of production technology and
the division of labour within the firm also shape management labour
decisions. Technology is here taken to mean not just machines and
technical processes, but also how these are organised and the way workers
are deployed around them. The division of labour is in part a function
of the extent of the product market and managerial capabilities. Where
markets were large and homogeneous and where firms had the organisa-
tional capability to organise production in innovative ways, it was more
likely that there would be a more extensive and sophisticated division
of labour.[16] The organisation of production is also shaped by the availabil-
ity of labour in the labour market, and here the argument that, up to the
Second World War, Britain for the most part had an abundance of labour,
including skilled craft labour, is important in that it often acted as a
disincentive to change in work organisation. The choices which manage-
ment makes in this area and its interactions with its labour force are
referred to in this book as work relations.
The final proposition is that, in making labour decisions, there are a
number of choices open to the employer. However, these choices are not
limitless. One way to conceive the choices is as follows: the employer
can either externalise activities in the market, internalise them within the
boundaries of the firm, or co-ordinate them by various combinations of
the two. This concept may be applied to decisions in the three areas of
work relations, employment relations, and industrial relations.
In terms of work relations, the concepts of internalising and externalis-
ing can be used to analyse a number of important labour decisions. For
example, the firm can externalise by relying on different forms of subcon-
tracting to organise production or it can internalise by more directly
organising its own workforce. Thus one significant historical change was
the movement from putting-out systems of production, to various forms
of subcontracting, and to direct production within the firm. Over time,
there has been some backward and forward movement between these
different ways of organising work. The notion of internalising and exter-
nalising can also be used to analyse skill formation and transformation,
in other words, training arrangements. Thus the firm can externalise by
doing little or no training and poaching or recruiting labour in the market
which others have trained. Also, it could be said to externalise by relying
on apprenticeship arrangements which are occupationally orientated or
by making extensive use of state training facilities which train in externally
marketable skills. On the other hand, the firm can internalise by doing
its own training and making training more firm-specific.[17] Where and
how a worker acquires his skills is of extreme importance: it affects his
attitude towards those skills, his control over them, and his attitude to
technical change.

The management of labour 9

In terms of employment relations, the firm can externalise by relying
on the external market for labour; by recruiting and laying of! as demand
changes; by filling higher positions with external as well as internal
candidates; and by fixing wages according to external market signals.
Alternatively, the firm can internalise the employment relationship by
more systematically screening and recruiting workers; by making every
effort to make them permanent employees; by developing internal job
ladders and using internal promotion wherever possible; by fixing wages
more according to internal administrative principles than to market
forces; and by developing more extensive fringe benefits, often based on
seniority within the firm. In the former situation, where strategies of
externalisation are pursued, the employment contract is likely to be of
a minimal kind; in the latter it will be more complex and there will be
a more highly developed internal labour market.[18] (In this book the term
'internal labour market' is used to describe an elaborate internal employ-
ment system relatively insulated from external market forces. In this
sense the term is now widely accepted; however, it is something of a
misnomer, since what is being described is less of a market and more of
an internal administrative system.)
In industrial relations, managements can internalise by seeking to
promote their own employee representation system, such as a works
council, or by sponsoring a company union. Where management does
recognise an outside union, it will seek to bargain domestically within
the firm and will handle grievances and disputes internally through its
own in-house procedures. By contrast, a firm can be said to externalise
its industrial relations when it hands dealings with a trade union over
to an association of employers outside the firm. This type of employers'
organisation sets wages according to external market criteria and proces-
ses grievances through an external disputes procedure. This use of
employers' associations is a form of externalisation, though it might
perhaps be better termed 'co-ordination by cooperation';[19] certainly it
represents a form of delegation to an outside body.
In reality, firms will often use a combination of these strategies. For
example, they may use different strategies for different types of labour,
showing more of a tendency to internalise in the case of higher level
employees who are in short supply or who possess firm-specific skills.
They may also move between different types of strategy over time as
market conditions change. But such moves occur infrequently and come
about slowly. The argument that will be developed in this book is that,
in general, British employers in the nineteenth and early twentieth cen-
turies tended to prefer market mechanisms and to externalise their labour
activities. This contrasts with tendencies in other countries, especially
among large firms in the USA, Germany, and Japan, where there was a


-----

10 Markets, firms, and the management of labour

stronger tendency to rely more on internal systems of co-ordination. Yet
British firms were never monolithic, and it is significant that there were
always exceptions to the general pattern. Strategies of externalisation
existed where product markets were small, fragmented, and competitive
and where labour markets provided an ample supply of workers. They
also existed where firms had simple divisions of labour and lacked the
organisational capability to develop and administer strong internal sys-
tems. In these circumstances, it made more sense for employers to rely
on market rather than administrative co-ordination. Strategies of inter-
nalisation occurred when administrative co-ordination permitted a more
effective and efficient labour management than co-ordination by market
mechanisms. Internalisation therefore depended on markets, was related
to more sophisticated divisions of labour, and required more advanced
managerial hierarchies. The argument is that, through the course of the
twentieth century, there has been a growing tendency, on the part of
British firms, to internalise labour activities and to develop stronger
internal arrangements. However, this development of strategies of inter-
nalisation has been slow and uneven.
The contention, then, is that markets, as mediated through firm-level
structures, managerial hierarchies, and the division of labour, go a long
way to explain the choice of employer strategies in the labour field. Such
strategies can be seen in a broad sense as policies of either internalisation
or externalisation. Historically, in the British case, limited internalisation
represented, for most employers, a rational response to the ease of
organising transactions through markets. At the same time, it also rep-
resented a failure of employer action, reflecting the weakness of corporate
structures and managerial hierarchies. Thus, in Britain, the invisible hand
of the market dominated labour management, and the visible handshake
of closer and more lasting relations between employers and employees
made only slow progress.[20]

As stated so far the argument prompts two questions. First, can it
really be said that historically British employers pursued policies in the
labour field which added up to anything so grand as strategies? Many
might feel that employers merely reacted opportunistically to events and
at best muddled through. In the case of British employers, there is indeed
much to this contention, and the idea of opportunistic behaviour fits well
with the notion that employers pursued short-term, market-orientated
policies. However, in considering strategies, a useful distinction may be
drawn between intended and enacted strategies: intended strategies are
those which are consciously and purposively developed ex ante; enacted
strategies are those practices which grow incrementally over time and
which, with the benefit of hindsight, reveal a certain pattern of actions

The management of labour 11

_ex post.[21] In this book, the term strategy is used in both senses. It is_
argued that historically most British employers did not intentionally
develop and implement long-term strategies. Instead they reacted in an
_ad hoc and often opportunistic manner, responding to market conditions._
Despite this general pattern, however, there were always some firms
which did consciously develop strategies of a more consistent nature,
and their number, it is argued, has increased over time. The approach
of the book attempts to examine both the general pattern of enacted
strategies while at the same time explaining the exceptional espousal of
intended strategies.
This leads to a second question. Did employers' labour strategies matter
in the sense of their bearing any relationship to the economic performance
of firms, industries, and the British economy as a whole? There is, of
course, a large literature on the performance of British entrepreneurs
and the relative decline of the British economy from the late nineteenth
century onwards. Much of this concentrates on factors other than labour;
where it deals with labour matters, it has tended to focus on the role of
workers and trade unions and has paid less attention to the management,
or mismanagement, of labour. The relationship between managerial
decisions in this area and economic performance is explored throughout
the book. The gist of the argument which will be presented is that the
management of labour did matter. In the nineteenth century, British
employers pursued labour policies of externalisation which had a certain
economic rationality, at least in contemporary circumstances and in the
short term. However, as circumstances changed and as foreign firms
developed alternative arrangements, these policies became less appropri-
ate for successful business performance. It is hoped that the perspective
offered here will provide some insights into the economic performance
of British firms and industries.
The book is divided into three chronological parts. The first deals with
the inheritance from the nineteenth century, where, it is argued, certain
patterns of labour management were set which had a profound influence
well into the twentieth century. The second part covers the years from
the turn of the century up to the Second World War. This is shown as
a period of significant changes, especially in terms of the growth of the
modern business enterprise, but also of considerable continuity in terms
of labour management. The third part then covers the post-1945 years
which are seen as a time of growing challenge to existing patterns of
labour management and a period of more rapid adaptation towards more
internalised systems. However, significant elements of the older pattern
and related attitudes still persisted. The final chapter reverts to the initial
propositions and draws some general conclusions. Since the argument


-----

12 Markets, firms, and the management of labour

places great emphasis on markets, corporate structures and hierarchies,
and the division of labour as key variables, each of the historical periods
begins with an analysis of this background. This is to be found in the
first part of Chapter 2 for the nineteenth century, in Chapter 3 for the
first half of the twentieth century, and in Chapter 6 for the post-1945
period. This background is presented rather schematically, but it provides
context on markets, firms, and the organisation of production which is
essential for the development of the argument. Within each chronological
part, work relations, employment relations, and industrial relations are
dealt with thematically. It is hoped that this combination of a chronologi-
cal and thematic approach enables a considerable amount of empirical
material to be presented in historical context.
To revert to the basic theme. Where product markets were fragmented
and slow growing and where external labour markets were well-stocked
and operated reasonably efficiently, this predisposed firms to choose
certain labour strategies. Where, in addition, firms were small, or even
where they were large but loosely co-ordinated with weak managerial
hierarchies, and where traditional technologies and divisions of labour
persisted, firms tended to espouse strategies of externalisation and inter-
nal systems of labour management remained weak. Where, on the other
hand, markets were large and growing, where firms developed the organ-
isational capability to take advantage of this, and where they successfully
introduced more sophisticated technologies and forms of work organisa-
tion which required more firm-specific labour, employers tended to make
certain decisions about labour which led to more internalised systems.
In Britain, the former type of strategic choices predominated from the
nineteenth century onwards and created a set of institutional arrange-
ments and attitudes which persisted well into the twentieth century.
Change towards more internalised systems of human resource manage-
ment has come only slowly and unevenly. International comparisons
suggest that British employers relied on externalisation more than their
counterparts in other advanced economies such as the US, Germany,
and Japan; these strategies have had adverse consequences for economic
performance and national competitiveness.

### Markets, firms, and the management of labour in the nineteenth century

A central argument of this book is that market and firm structures and
the organisation of production had a major impact on the management
of labour. Market conditions provided either an incentive or a disincen-
tive to particular labour strategies; corporate structures and managerial
hierarchies either facilitated or obstructed the implementation of par-
ticular policies. The organisation of production, in part shaped by market
and firm structures, but also chosen by employers, in turn promoted or
constrained labour policies. In this chapter the nineteenth-century back-
ground of market conditions, corporate structure, and the organisation
of production is examined. Within this context, the chapter then examines
managerial decisions in the areas of work relations, employment relations,
and industrial relations and shows how, for the most part, British
employers pursued strategies of externalisation.

**Markets and firms**

During the course of the nineteenth century, markets grew in geographical
scope, largely as a result of improvements in transportation and cost
reductions. At the end of the century, some markets remained pre-
dominantly local in nature, for example, in building, in consumer dur-
ables such as clothing and furniture making, and in non-durables such
as brewing and baking. Other markets were already national in scope,
especially those in packaged consumer goods such as soap, biscuits,
sugar confectionery, and cigarettes. Still other markets in which British
firms operated, such as cotton, iron and steel, and shipbuilding, were
more international in scope. In the late nineteenth century in most markets
there was an increase in competition, and in particular manufacturers
involved in international trade became aware of an intensification in
foreign competition, especially from the US and Germany. However,
despite calls for protection, Britain remained, up to the First World War,
an open economy committed to free trade.[1]

16 The inheritance

There were other features of British markets which need to be stressed.
Most British firms produced a broad range of goods and, with a few
exceptions, there was only a slow trend towards standardised mass
markets. Firms chose to specialise, produced on a 'bespoke' basis, and
were content to differentiate their production. Within Britain, substantial
differences existed in markets with a broad spread from high quality and
luxury to low quality goods. In overseas markets, British firms exported
to a large number of countries, in some of which they had established
particular market niches and, in Empire markets, they usually enjoyed
favoured positions. This meant that the markets for British manufacturers
were extremely diverse, and there was less progress towards standardisa-
tion than was developing at this time in the US or Germany.
Though most British markets were subject to strong competitive press-
ures, there also existed in Britain a long tradition of market sharing and
price fixing.[2] In the late nineteenth century, confronted by new competi-
tive pressures and a squeeze on profits, there was a growth in such
collusive practices and in the number and stability of cartel associations.
This was not hindered by legal sanctions in Britain, unlike in the US
where from 1890 onwards so-called trusts became illegal. It will be argued
below that these practices had important implications for labour manage-
ment: where successful they reduced competitive pressures on firms to
innovate in labour matters, and trade association activity encouraged the
reliance on employers' organisations in the labour market.[3]

In most industries the typical late nineteenth-century firm was a small
or medium-sized, single-plant operation, employing tens of workers and
with limited capital assets. Most were private companies, usually both
family-owned and -managed and rarely adopting limited liability status.[4]

There were, of course, exceptions to this. The railway companies were
amongst the largest enterprises in Victorian Britain, with massive capital
assets, professional managers, and tens of thousands of employees. By
1900 a number of other large firms had emerged in manufacturing
industry. These included firms in certain sectors of textiles, such as textile
finishing and sewing cotton (J. & P. Coats, Bleachers' Association, and
Calico Printers); in armaments, shipbuilding, and iron and steel (Vickers,
Armstrong Whitworth, John Brown, Cammell Laird, Dorman Long, and
Stewart & Lloyds); in chemicals and related industries (Brunner Mond,
Nobels, the Gas Light & Coke Company, and the South Metropolitan
Gas Company); and in consumer goods industries (Lever Bros., Imperial
Tobacco, Huntley & Palmers, and the large breweries).[5] The majority of
these, however, were relatively new creations at the turn of the century
and, at first, had a limited effect on the pattern of labour management
in Britain.


-----

The management of labour in the nineteenth century 17

Two further points must be made about the few large firms which had
emerged in manufacturing by the end of the century. First, while some
of them were large by international standards, many were smaller in
terms of capital and output than their American and German counter-
parts, particularly in iron and steel and engineering. In part, the reasons
for this related to market size and structure. By the late nineteenth century,
the British economy was already smaller than that of the US and was
growing at a slower rate than either the US or Germany. Furthermore,
within Britain, markets were geographically concentrated and relatively
efficient with good commodity exchanges and distribution networks
which, to some extent, obviated the need to build larger firms.[6] Second,
many of the larger British enterprises, especially those created by merger,
operated as holding companies which were loosely organised as feder-
ations of firms, with small central headquarters, little co-ordination or
integration, and with operating decisions left to the constituent com-
panies. In most cases owners and their families continued to control and
manage both at holding company and subsidiary level. Herein was
another contrast with the US (and, though to a lesser extent, with
Germany) where larger enterprises had emerged which were more
integrated and co-ordinated by more extensive managerial hierarchies.[7]

However, again there were exceptions in Britain, with some medium and
large firms developing more centralised forms of control and more
extensive managerial hierarchies. These exceptions included the large
railway companies as well as manufacturing enterprises such as the gas
companies, some large chemical companies (Nobels, Brunner Mond,
United Alkali), some consumer goods manufacturers (J. & P. Coats and
Lever Bros, at Port Sunlight), and some of the American-owned firms
located in Britain (Singer Sewing Machine Company and British Westing-
house). On the whole, however, even in larger firms, organisational and
managerial structures remained rudimentary.[8]

**Managerial hierarchies with special reference to the**
**management of labour**

The cadre of managerial employees grew only slowly in nineteenth-
century Britain. Even by 1907 the proportion of managerial, technical,
and clerical staff to production workers in manufacturing industry was
only 8.6 per cent, smaller than in the US and Germany.[9] As significant
was the fact that a smaller proportion of British managers had been
educated to college or university level than their counterparts in the US,
Germany, or even in the embryonic Japanese large firm.[10] Broadly speak-
ing, owners and managers who had received any formal training beyond

18 The inheritance

school level were most likely only to have served an apprenticeship and
only a small proportion had attended any sort of technical college.[11]

Lower level managers and foremen had at best served an apprenticeship
and were usually promoted from the shopfloor.[12] However, among the
sons of owners and senior managers in large firms, a growing proportion
went to private schools or the older universities where they tended to
study liberal and classical subjects.[13] In this way, by the late nineteenth
century, a divide was emerging in some larger firms between those at the
top, who received an education fit for a 'gentleman', and lower manage-
ment, who prided themselves on 'practical' experience rather than formal
education or training.[14]

Early British industrialisation had not depended greatly on formally
educated scientists and engineers. Even by the late nineteenth century,
engineers and scientists, with university or college education, were rare
in British industry. For the most part technical staff acquired their
competence through an apprenticeship or pupillage of some kind.
Engineers, for example, were likely to have combined an apprenticeship,
on the shopfloor or in the drawing office, with some part-time college
education, perhaps leading to membership of a professional association.[15]

From the final quarter of the nineteenth century onwards, there was a
growing criticism of British deficiences in technical and scientific training,
especially when compared to Germany and the USA. There are a number
of possible explanations why British firms may have been less receptive
to university- or college-trained manpower. First, since few entrepreneurs
and senior managers themselves had benefited from a technical education,
it is likely that they failed to see its importance in others and provide
good career opportunities for such staff. Second, where firms needed
expertise, they could look to the market and buy it in, from other firms,
from abroad, and from consulting engineers and chemists.[16] Third, many
British firms, relying on well-tried techniques and with access to a
relatively abundant supply of skilled manual labour, felt little need to
develop their managerial and technical hierarchies where graduates
would be appropriate.[17] These deficiencies were extensively (though
inconclusively) investigated and debated at the time. In practice, it is
likely that, in the more scientifically based industries, such as chemical
dyestuffs and electrical engineering, where Britain had initially been a
pioneer in terms of inventions, the paucity of technical manpower retar-
ded innovation and impeded performance.[18]

In terms of labour management, hierarchies remained particularly
rudimentary and traditional. In smaller firms the owner himself was
directly involved in the management and supervision of workers, though
in all but the smallest this function was shared with others. In practice,

this often meant the delegation of responsibilities to internal subcontrac-
tors or senior skilled workers. Under internal subcontracting systems,
the functions of recruiting a labour force, monitoring production, and
paying workers were handed over to a subcontractor or gang master.
Such arrangements were widespread in nineteenth-century industries
such as coal mining and iron making. So also were systems where skilled
men hired, supervised, and paid their own helpers or underhands as was
the custom in cotton spinning, shipbuilding, and pottery.[19] Such practices
seem to have persisted longer in Britain than in other countries. By the
late nineteenth century, however, internal subcontracting had been con-
siderably reduced as competitive and technological changes pressured
employers to cut out these middle-men and replace them with their own
foremen. Nevertheless, the foremen who took their place still often ran
their departments with considerable autonomy in matters of hiring, work
allocation, and labour management. Only a few larger firms developed
more elaborate supervisory systems more directly under the control of
a hierarchy of middle and senior managers.[20]

**Continuities and change in the organisation of work**

In considering work organisation it is useful, by way of introduction, to
go back to the classical economists for they paid considerable attention
to the division of labour and the organisation of work. In The Wealth of
_Nations, Adam Smith argued that the subdivision of work into more_
specialised activities provided real efficiency advantages: it increased
proficiency, reduced time-wasting, and stimulated mechanisation. The
resultant increase in prosperity offset any disadvantages in terms of
narrow tasks and worker alienation. For Smith, the division of labour
was dependent on the market and the extent of the division was limited
only by the extent of the market.[21] A further advantage of the division
of labour was pointed out by Babbage, namely that it allowed employers
to allocate jobs to workers according to their specialist skills and to
deploy skilled workers exclusively on skilled work, paying them accord-
ingly. For him, also, the main force driving the division of labour was
competition in the market.[22] By contrast, Marx analysed the division of
labour within the firm more in terms of production than market relations.
It was the capitalist's need to control production and extract more surplus
value from workers which, in his view, created the division of labour.
With the availability of more advanced technologies and the application
of scientific principles, control could increasingly be built into machinery
with the result that workers were reduced to unskilled machine minders.[23]

Later Marxists have stated a more general deskilling thesis: according


-----

20 The inheritance

to Braverman, under capitalism employers seek to reduce the skill content
of work so as to make labour more substitutable, to reduce training costs,
and to minimise worker control over the production process. Put another
way, the capitalist uses deskilling to transfer knowledge of the work
process from the worker to himself, thereby increasing his own control.[24]

In practice, the causes of the division of labour, the intentions of
employers, and the actual working-out of technical and organisational
changes were extremely complex. Overall, in the nineteenth century,
there were considerable continuities in Britain in terms of work organisa-
tion. In cotton textiles, for example, traditional methods of working
remained widespread. Though towards the end of the century there was
some introduction of new ring spindles and automatic looms to replace
mule spinning and traditional looms, change was limited. Faced with
competitive pressures, cotton employers sought to intensify work within
existing technologies, but their success in this respect was in turn limited
by resistance, in particular from skilled workers.[25] In most sectors of
engineering too, though new machines were available and introduced
and though the employers won two notable victories (in 1852 and 1897-8)
against the trade unions over the right to introduce new methods of
working on such machines, in practice most firms persisted with tradi-
tional work methods and did not push through major technological
reorganisation. As Zeitlin has shown, they preferred to resort to cost
cutting and work intensification rather than to introduce new methods
of mass production.[26] In iron and steel British employers continued to
rely on traditional skills and used labour-intensive processes at a time
when American and German producers were developing newer tech-
niques, using more capital equipment, and relying less on skilled labour.[27]

In coal mining, change also came slowly and traditional methods of
working prevailed throughout the British coalfields, with only limited
use of coal-cutting and other machinery.[28]

Various reasons have been put forward as to why there was so much
continuity. For example, it is sometimes argued that British craft unions
imposed high costs on technological and organisational change thus
rendering innovation unattractive. This may be true in part, but it is easy
to exaggerate the strength of trade unionism at this time and to argue
from particular instances to a general proposition. Even in the case of
shipbuilding, where craft unions were particularly strong, most recent
studies have questioned the negative effect of trade union organisation
and practices.[29] It is also sometimes suggested that British entrepreneurs
were conservative and deficient in technical knowledge and a willingness
to apply new science-based methods.[30] Again there may be some truth
in this, though the existence of exceptions casts doubt on a general


-----

The management of labour in the nineteenth century 21

explanation on these lines. A more powerful explanation of continuity,
it is argued here, focuses on the nature of markets and firms. On the
labour market side, in Britain in most trades there was an adequate
supply of workers, including skilled labour; there was, therefore, no great
incentive to substitute capital for labour as was the case in American
and to some extent German industry. On the product market side, as
already suggested, many British firms produced a wide range of goods
for diverse markets, which meant there was less incentive to standardise
products and introduce mass-production methods. Small- and medium-
sized firms and loosely administered larger firms, which predominated
in many British industries, did not pursue long-term investment or pro-
duction policies which would have led to new techniques and patterns
of work organisation.[31]

However, there were areas of British industry where in the late nine-
teenth century employers introduced considerable changes in production
technologies which substantially altered the organisation of work. These
changes occurred in industries where new technical processes became
available, where markets were created for standardised products, and
where large firms grew up to co-ordinate mass production. This was the
case in particular in process type industries such as chemicals and some
areas of food processing. In the alkali sector of the chemical industry,
in the final quarter of the nineteenth century, the firm Brunner Mond
replaced the traditional Leblanc method of batch production with the
new Solvay process of continuous production.[32] In the manufacture of
gunpowder and soap, semi-continuous processes replaced hand-produc-
tion methods and the two industries came to be dominated respectively
by Nobel and Lever Bros.[33] In certain consumer-goods industries, new
processes were adopted to serve growing mass markets and these in turn
came to be dominated by a few large firms. From the 1880s onwards, in
the flour-milling industry, the traditional stone-grinding method of mill-
ing in wind- and water-mills was replaced by automatic roller milling.
One result was that, relatively quickly, two firms, J. Rank & Co. and
Spillers & Co., came to dominate the industry.[34] In sugar refining H.
Tate & Co. and A. Lyle & Co. transformed sugar boiling into a modern
industry with the introduction of superheated steam and centrifugal
processing machines.[35] The production of standardised flour and sugar,
together with growing mass markets, encouraged technological change
in biscuit baking and chocolate confectionery. These traditional trades
were transformed by the introduction of new machines and the beginnings
of flow line production. Soon a small number of large firms came to
dominate - Huntley & Palmers, Peak Frean, McVitie & Price, Carrs,
Jacobs, Cadburys, Frys, and Rowntrees.[36] In the manufacture of cigarettes

and matches new American continuous process machines and pneumatic
transfer systems also transformed traditional work methods and again
the industries came to be dominated by leading firms, Imperial Tobacco
and Bryant & May.[37] In all these cases, there were substantial changes
in the organisation of work. Some of this involved deskilling, the creation
of more semi-skilled and unskilled jobs, and greater employer control
over production. However, old skills often survived and new skills were
also created, especially in maintenance areas.
In those industries, with craft origins, but where the market was large
enough, there were also changes in work organisation. Thus, in engineer-
ing, in the bicycle industry, a few manufacturers recognised the demand
for more standardised products and introduced new machine tools and
interchangeability in assembly.[38] Likewise, the American Singer Sewing
Machine company equipped its Clydeside factory with new automatic
machine tools in the 1880s, thus considerably expanding its semi-skilled
labour force and earning the firm a reputation among the Scottish business
community as the epitome of 'the fine art of production'.[39] In the arma-
ments sector of the engineering industry, where demand was for larger
runs and often more stable than in other sectors, a few large firms such
as Vickers, Armstrong Whitworth, and the Birmingham Small Arms
Company were large investors in new machine tools and leaders in
production techniques involving interchangeable parts, large batch pro-
duction, and the use of special 'feed and speed' men to monitor machine
**40**
operations.
The main motivation behind most of these changes was to take advan-
tage of the opportunities offered by new technologies and expanding
markets and to gain economies of scale. In some cases, such as the gas
industry, the desire to eliminate more skilled labour from crucial stages
in the production process may have been crucial.[41] But it was usually
not the case that labour considerations were of central importance, and
the evidence is against a simple deskilling thesis. This is not to deny that
changes were taking place in the late nineteenth century in the deployment
of skill: some traditional manual skills disappeared or were reduced in
industries such as iron and steel, printing, and areas of engineering;
however, many old skills survived and new skills were also created in
areas such as maintenance and electrical work. In industries where change
was considerable such as parts of the chemical and food-processing
industries, labour had never been particularly skilled and does not seem
to have constituted a problem for employers. Here technical change often
meant less heavy manual work and different responsibilities for workers.
In industries where skilled labour was crucial, one of the most striking
points is that it often continued to be central and workers maintained


-----

considerable control. A final point on the organisation of work is that,
even by the end of the nineteenth century, there was in Britain little in
the way of a 'scientific' approach to the management of production. It
is true that some new ideas and practices, both indigenous and imported
from the US, were beginning to emerge concerning production organisa-
tion, cost accounting, and new methods of wage payment. However,
these had made little progress in Britain before the turn of the century
and had no effect on the majority of firms.[42]

**Employment relations**

We turn now to employment relations and look at the recruitment and
training of workers, the nature of jobs, and the type of pay and benefit
systems. The recruitment of labour in the nineteenth-century enterprise
was usually ad hoc, casual, and often based on family contacts. Where
subcontracting existed it was left to the subcontractor to take on the
number of workers required. Where labour was directly employed,
recruitment was delegated to the foreman who made his own selection
at the factory gates.[43] Discharge was also the responsibility of the foreman
who often acted instantly and arbitrarily. As one engineering employer
put it, The workman may be told by the foreman at a moment's notice
that he is no longer wanted.'[44] Once recruited, training of the labour
force took a number of different forms. In the first place, employers'
initial reaction was to poach labour and to benefit from skills acquired
elsewhere. In a period of high labour mobility, as during most of the
nineteenth century, this was a reasonable expectation. For most work
where little skill was involved, training was minimal and consisted of
casually acquiring experience on the job. For work of a more skilled
nature, opportunities were provided to pick up the trade on the job. The
single most important formal method of training in the nineteenth century
was the craft apprenticeship served over a five- or seven-year period.[45]

Various aspects of the apprenticeship system need to be stressed. First,
outside small workshops, employers did not themselves provide or control
the training. Rather they delegated it to the foreman who in turn handed
it over to a skilled journeyman. It was up to him then to find the time
to train the apprentice. Second, in this way the apprenticeship constituted
a low-cost method of training, and apprentices were a source of cheap
labour. Third, though the apprenticeship was usually served within one
firm, the expectation was that the apprentice should acquire all-round,
externally marketable skills. The standards varied from firm to firm, but
there is reason to believe that much training had a high general content.
In large part this suited employers who, where product ranges were


-----

24 The inheritance

broad, required a versatile workforce; it suited the apprentice who wished
to be mobile; equally it suited the trade union because adherence to
standards of all-round training simultaneously limited the supply of
entrants into the trade and increased workers' chances of mobility.
The amount and type of training was one factor which affected the
structure of jobs and the security, or otherwise, of employment within
the firm. Job tenure varied considerably. At one extreme, there were
those jobs where employment was by the day as in dockwork; in other
instances, the worker was hired on a 'job and finish' basis as in building
and shipbuilding; other jobs were for a season as in some agricultural
and food-processing work and unskilled jobs in gas works. In addition
outworking was still widespread in parts of textiles, clothing, and foot-
wear and here workers were employed and paid by the piece.[46] In other
areas of factory employment, where plant and equipment needed to be
run more intensively, there was in the late nineteenth century a downward
trend in the proportion of labour hired on a casual basis and an increase
in the proportion of workers more or less permanently employed by the
firm.[47] However, almost all industries were subject to cyclical fluctuations
and periodic layoffs. Within the firm there were differences in security
of employment between classes of labour. Foremen and those in principal
clerical positions had more security than manual workers. The core of
skilled men had more chance of regular employment than less skilled
men and women for most of whom job tenure was precarious.
Pay and benefit systems were for the most part commensurate with
this pattern of employment and were rudimentary in nature. Most nine-
teenth-century workers were paid by time rates with levels fixed according
to customary notions. In the case of skilled men, craft unions tried to
insist on the standard rate, the union rate for the external labour market;
and, in relation to this, the rates of other workers were set. Adjustments
up or down were then made on the basis of changes in the cost of living
or the selling price of the product and in some cases this was accomplished
by automatic sliding-scale arrangements.[48] There was some increase in
the use of piece work in the late nineteenth century. Depending on the
type, piecework can represent an essentially short-term commodity view
of the employment relationship between the employer and employee.
Certainly, simple proportional piece-work systems, where the worker
was paid exclusively for the number of items produced, with no guaran-
teed fall-back wage, represented a minimal relationship. Such systems
were used in outworking employment and in clothing, footwear, and the
light metal trades. In the late nineteenth century there was a growth in
more elaborate piece-work systems of the bonus kind which had an
advantage for the worker in that a minimum time rate was usually assured.


-----

The management of labour in the nineteenth century 25

However, these were often regressive and the bonus was usually fixed
so that it increased at a diminishing rate.[49] Commensurate with these
pay systems, the formal provision of benefits such as paid holidays,
sickness schemes, and pensions was relatively rare.
Thus the majority of nineteenth-century employers provided limited
benefits and used simple pay systems. They preferred to link pay either
to customary notions or to short-term measures of output and to adjust
wages according to changes in the cost of living in the locality or to the
selling price of the product in the external market. Internal wage struc-
tures were unplanned and rudimentary. However, the cash nexus was
not the only bond between employers and workers, for there was, in
nineteenth-century Britain, a long tradition of industrial paternalism.

**Paternalism: traditional and bureaucratic**

Paternalism provided an ideological dimension to the employment
relationship, based on notions of protection, reciprocal obligations, and
harmony. As such, it was a method of self-justification for the paternalist
and a means of persuading employees to accept their position in the
employment relationship. In addition, paternalism provided economic
arrangements which denoted a more comprehensive approach to the
employment relationship. The paternalist employer offered, if not higher
wages, then at least more regular employment and earnings, plus a
broader array of benefits, and in return expected greater attachment and
loyalty from his workers.
Early and mid-nineteenth-century paternalism, with antecedents reach-
ing back to agricultural origins,[50] covered a wide spectrum. The most
prominent examples were some of the great northern mill owners. By
comparison with other firms, they offered more regular earnings, provided
company housing, and in some cases built model villages with schools,
churches, and recreational facilities.[51] In some cases religious sentiment
undoubtedly played a part. Pollard, however, has argued that such
employers were motivated less by a definite religious or moral outlook
and more by a pragmatic assessment of their circumstances.[52] Many had
built new factories, away from the main industrial centres, often to take
advantage of better sources of water power, and, in large part, their
paternalist provision was intended to attract and retain a labour force
and to ensure efficient and dependable use of new plant and equipment.
It is notable also that the main paternalist firms were large and successful,
sometimes with dominant market positions which enabled them to finance
the costs of paternalism. Though paternalistic provision of this kind

existed in smaller firms, it was always on a lesser scale and more tentative
and precarious.[53]

The essence of traditional paternalism was as follows. First, it was of
a personal nature, in that there was a significant degree of personal
knowledge and mutual interaction between the employer and his workers.
Second, it was locally based and relied on a strong link between family,
company, and community.[54] Third, the provision of benefits was a gift
from the employer, thus it was both ad hoc and ad hominem (the term
is used advisedly since it was less likely to cover women) and there was
no contractual right to benefits. Essentially, traditional paternalism was
commensurate with the owner-controlled single-factory or at least single-
locality enterprise where an ideology of personal attachment and com-
munity could be fostered. It was difficult to sustain this in larger, multi-
unit, national companies, thus creating the need for new approaches and
systems in such enterprises. On these lines Joyce has suggested that
paternalism declined in the late nineteenth century and gave way to a
more instrumental attitude to labour. For him the main factors causing
this decline were the loosening of the influence of religious ideas, the
growing impact of more independent, class-based political ideas, and
increasing urbanisation and suburbanisation which physically distanced
both workers and owners from the place of work and eroded the notion
of a factory community. Joyce also stresses changes on the employers'
side, especially the spread of the limited liability company and the decline
of family involvement.[55]

However, a small number of large firms did start to develop employ-
ment systems different from both traditional paternalism and the
dominant employment pattern which it has been suggested was one of
minimal attachment and externalisation. It is important to examine some
of these more bureaucratic employment systems, since they represented
attempts at internalisation of the employment relationship and had
features akin to what economists now term internal labour markets,
defined as more complicated internal employment systems relatively
insulated from external market forces.[56]

The best place to start is with the railway companies which were the
largest and most capital-intensive enterprises in Victorian Britain. As
already stated, they were pioneers in using joint-stock organisation and
in developing managerial techniques. Their employment policies were
also distinctive. In the first place, they recruited labour rather more
systematically, often requiring references and proof of ability to read
and write.[57] Once recruited, if the worker wished to stay in employment
and did not infringe company rules, the practice of most companies was
to keep workers until retirement age, offering the possibility of promotion


-----

The management of labour in the nineteenth century 27

through an elaborate hierarchy of grades and classifications with different
levels of pay and benefits. Promotion through the grades might sometimes
be affected by favouritism, but it depended most on seniority and loyalty.
The wages of those at the bottom were low, but at the top were good
and in some cases were supplemented by bonuses for long service. Some
of the benefits provided by the railway companies, such as housing, were
traditional in nature.[58] More novel was the provision by some companies
of sick pay and pension schemes based on length of service.[59] Overall,
these systems were less personal, more bureaucratic, and covered a larger
number of dispersed operating units than in the traditional paternalist
firm.[60]

Some of the large gas companies provide other examples. The two
largest firms were the main London companies, the Gas Light & Coke
Co. and the South Metropolitan Gas Co., both of which were more
systematic and selective than other companies in their recruitment.[61]

They provided internal training systems for their key workers and offered
reasonable security of employment to core process workers and fitters,
with progression up an albeit short hierarchy.[62] Along with this core,
they also employed a large number of labourers who were treated less
favourably and laid off when demand fell.[63] Key workers were obliged
to be mobile within the firm and to move to care and maintenance jobs,
for example, in the summer months when demand for gas fell. Both firms
paid good wages and offered extensive benefits. Thus the Gas Light &
Coke Co. introduced sick pay and pension arrangements. The South
Metropolitan also provided an extensive range of benefits such as paid
holidays, sickness, accident, and insurance schemes, and pension
arrangements. It constituted what Melling has called 'virtually an insular
welfare state'.[64] In the case of the South Metropolitan its employment
provisions were aimed at preventing the incursions of trade unionism.
After the famous strike of 1889-90, the company extended its arrange-
ments: it converted an earlier profit-sharing system into a so-called
co-partnership or share ownership scheme; it transformed its pension
arrangements from an optional to a compulsory basis; and it established,
as a rival to the Gas Workers Union, an internal representation plan
which gave employees a say, albeit limited, in the administration of the
system.[65]

A number of other large manufacturing firms developed similar
arrangements. In chemicals, Brunner Mond provided good internal train-
ing, offered relatively secure jobs, and in the final decades of the nine-
teenth century began to provide paid holidays, sick benefits, and a pension
scheme.[66] In the rapidly expanding consumer goods industries, a few
large firms such as Lever Bros, and Cadburys also developed new and


-----

28 The inheritance

more systematic arrangements. Both were well-known for the provision
of housing in their model villages at Port Sunlight and Bournville. Both
also introduced new employment techniques. Lever Bros, provided inter-
nal education and training, paid holidays, sick pay and a pension scheme.
The firm also introduced a copartnership scheme under which certificates
were issued entitling holders to an annual dividend. According to Lord
Lever, 'the wages system had broken down as the sole or only solution
to the labour problem'.[67] Likewise Cadburys provided continuation
schooling and technical education and extensive fringe benefits.[68]

Recently Fitzgerald has pointed to similar examples in other large con-
sumer-goods, food, and brewing companies.[69] It has also been argued
that similar systems existed in some large firms in craft-type industries,
for example in engineering and shipbuilding. Firms such as Vickers,
Armstrong Whitworth, and Beardmores have been cited.[70] While it is
true that these firms did provide good internal training, job security for
key workers, and various welfare benefits, they were exceptions and most
firms in less favourable market positions in such industries provided only
minimal employment systems and conformed to the predominant pattern
of externalisation.

**Employment pattern explained**

There are two main questions which this description of employer policies
and employment patterns pose. Why was the predominant pattern one
of minimal attachment between employers and their workers, rudimen-
tary pay and benefit systems, and externalisation? Why, in a minority of
firms, did there emerge a more innovative pattern with more regular
employment, more complex pay and benefit systems, and more internal-
isation? A satisfactory explanation needs to comprehend both of these
patterns.
There are a number of possible ideological and cultural explanations.
It might be argued that the pattern of employment relations in Britain
was set in the nineteenth-century age of laissez-faire, when the dominant
belief was that the employer should be free to hire and fire and the
worker equally free to quit and move. The employer should pay the
market price of the labour he bought, but the worker should remain
independent and responsible for his own welfare. Thus, Maine argued
that social relations and law in England had over time evolved from
being based on 'status' and had come to be based on 'contract'.[71] The
pre-industrial notion of a fixed rights and obligations in society had been
replaced by a contractual notion of work and an acceptance of the free
mobility of labour.[72] Dicey, writing about law and public opinion in


-----

The management of labour in the nineteenth century 29

England, also stressed the development of the notion of free contractual
agreements as a hallmark of the British system.[73] Thus it could be argued
that the ideology of laissez-faire influenced the practice of employers
and workers. A problem with this explanation, however, is that it is
difficult to demonstrate empirically the connection between ideas, law,
and practice. Nor does it explain why there were exceptions, unless these
are seen as the idiosyncratic policies of individual paternalists influenced
by personal morality or religious values. Though it might be possible to
argue this in some cases, it certainly does not explain all. It also leaves
unexplained why employers developed such policies at particular times.
There is another possible ideological and cultural explanation which
relates more to workers and their trade unions. The argument here is
that workers also accepted laissez-faire principles and valued their
independence and mobility. In the case of craft unions, their ideology
was based on a set of interrelated ideas: personal ownership of skills
and freedom to transfer these; common treatment for all workers of equal
skill; payment of a wage based on the rate for the job; and beyond this
the independence of the worker in determining his own welfare either
individually or through trade union collective self-help. Thus workers,
or at least those who had power through their trade unions, preferred a
_laissez-faire system of employment.[74] This explanation is consistent with_
the fact that many of the examples of extensive internal provision cited
above were situations where trade unions were weak or non-existent.
Indeed, some were also situations, as on the railways and in the gas
industry, where employers were determined to exclude trade unions.
Similarly, this explanation might also explain the relative absence of
such arrangements in engineering, shipbuilding, building, and printing
where craft unions were strong. However, some reservation must be
registered. The absence of trade unionism certainly did not imply the
existence of comprehensive welfare provision. In addition, one must be
careful not to exaggerate the power of trade unions, whose membership
was small before the twentieth century, and by itself craft unionism is
insufficient explanation of the weakness of internal labour market-type
arrangements in nineteenth-century Britain.
A more fruitful approach is to place nineteenth-century firms in their
market context. The labour market conditioned employers' thinking and
practices. Throughout most of the nineteenth century, there was always
an elastic supply of labour in Britain, especially unskilled but also skilled
craft labour.[75] From the employers' viewpoint, external labour markets
might not be perfect, but they were sufficiently good for there to be no
strong inducement to bypass them by creating internal markets. In a
buyers' market for labour, there was no strong incentive, except in the


-----

30 The inheritance

case of a few key workers, to retain labour and offer high wages and
benefits.
One problem with this labour-market explanation by itself is that it
does not at first sight explain the existence of exceptional firms. In part,
this objection may be met by the argument that these firms faced excep-
tional labour-market problems both in recruiting and retaining labour.
The large internalising firms cited above were capital intensive and some
had technologies which were industry- or even firm-specific. In these
cases special aspects of their employment relations may have been
developed for two reasons. In the first place, there was a strong pressure
on such firms to operate their plant and equipment as intensively as
possible in order to secure an adequate return on investment and for
this worker co-operation was essential. They also needed to be more
selective in recruitment and to devote more attention to training when
expensive equipment was involved and where this might also be unique
to the firm. The costs of turnover were therefore higher for them. Secondly,
it could be argued that the workers who entered these firms, acquiring
skills and experience which could not be used elsewhere, had an incentive
to stay. Also because they were less easily replaced, they were able to
secure more favourable treatment from their employers. Though this
argument has some real force, there are still problems. By no means all
the workers in these firms were skilled: indeed the majority were semi-
skilled or unskilled. Moreover, there were other industries, for example
shipbuilding and footwear, where technology and techniques were
industry-specific but where extensive internal provision did not emerge.
Thus, though industry- or firm-specific skills might be an important factor,
this is not in itself a sufficient explanation.
It is therefore necessary, for a full explanation, to include the firm's
product market and the related effect of this on the firm's organisation
and division of labour. Most of the firms which started to develop
something like structured internal labour markets were companies usually
operating in large and homogeneous markets and using continuous
process-type technologies or ones where continuity of operations was
important. Either because of a quasi-monopoly position or other market
advantages, they were less subject to violent shifts in product demand.
They were therefore better able to provide more regular employment and
more elaborate benefits. Moreover, to exploit their market situation and
to co-ordinate their various activities, these firms developed extensive
managerial hierarchies and effective co-ordination. They therefore had
the organisational resources and capability to develop and administer
more comprehensive employment policies than smaller employers or less
well co-ordinated firms. The majority of firms in the British economy in


-----

The management of labour in the nineteenth century 31

the late nineteenth century enjoyed less favourable product markets and
were smaller and less well co-ordinated. When faced with a downturn
in demand, it was easier for them to lay off workers and it made less
sense for them to develop comprehensive internal employment systems.

**Coining to terms with trade unions**

Sooner or later most employers have to deal with the representational
aspirations and collective tendencies of their workers. In nineteenth-
century Britain this meant learning to cope with trade unions. Recognition
of unions developed slowly and unevenly in the Victorian period. Many
employers in craft industries such as engineering, shipbuilding, and
printing and in industries such as cotton and coal mining had recognised
trade unions, though grudgingly, by the final quarter of the nineteenth
century. By 1888 there were some three-quarters of a million trade
unionists, about 10 per cent of adult male workers. Between 1889 and
1892 union membership increased to around 1.5 million, some of it
associated with so-called 'New Unionism' as organisation spread to less
skilled workers and hitherto unorganised industries such as the docks
and gas. Thereafter membership fell, but picked up again from the
mid-1890s onwards, so that, by the turn of the century, it stood at about
two million or approximately 15 per cent of the adult male labour force.
This represented a higher level of membership and employer recognition
than in any other industrial country.[76]

In many industries, therefore, trade unions were recognised by
employers by the turn of the century. The main groups of employers
who stood out against recognition were in predominantly semi- and
unskilled industries such as the railways, gas, and shipping where com-
panies used traditional tactics of blacklisting and the importation of
replacement labour in their attempts to exclude unions.[77] In 1909 the
Chairman of the South Eastern Railway Company strongly expressed
the right to manage philosophy: The Company has refused, and would
continue to refuse, to permit a third party to come to their board room
to discuss with them how they were to carry on their business.'[78] However,
in their recognition of trade unions other British employers had shown
a pragmatic acceptance of the fact that, though they might be able to
defeat trade unions in set-piece confrontations, they could not ignore or
exclude them entirely from their businesses. For these employers, the
costs of excluding them were becoming increasingly high, and in addition
some saw that there could be advantages in recognising trade unions
given certain conditions. As Phelps Brown pointed out, 'the trade unions


-----

32 The inheritance

of the Victorian era commended themselves, at least negatively'.[79] Unor-
ganised workers could be more unpredictable than trade unionists and
refusal to recognise unions threatened periodic disruption. Recognition,
on the other hand, held out the prospect of encouraging responsible
action and enforcing labour discipline. Where there was collusion
between employers in wage fixing, it also offered the potential of reducing
competition and increasing market control.
As already indicated, recognition was mainly of trade unions for
skilled male workers. Craft unionism had deep roots in many British
industries and, as has already been suggested, craft workers had consider-
able discretion and control at work. This craft control was in large part
developed out of workers' independent actions. In part, however, it arose
because of the nature of British employers: small and loosely co-ordinated
larger firms, with weak managerial hierarchies, dependent on flexible
production systems, had to accept much of the independence and job
control of their skilled workers.
A very significant feature of employer recognition of trade unions in
Britain was that it was often conceded and became formalised through
the medium of an employers' organisation. Such associations had a long
history in Britain,[80] but from the final quarter of the nineteenth century
there was an increase in their number and stability. At this time national
federations were established in most major British industries. Thus the
National Association of Master Builders was formed in 1877, the Feder-
ation of Master Cotton Spinners in 1891, and the Engineering Employers'
Federation in 1896.[81] The predecessors of some of these associations had
earlier sought to break trade unions when market conditions provided
the oppportunity. However, once union power had grown to such an
extent that the costs of trying to exclude it had become too high, there
seemed to be advantages in recognition through an employers' organisa-
tion. Employers thus hoped to deal with unions from a position of
collective strength and acted in the knowledge that their competitors
were in the same position. Such a medium of recognition was also
convenient, especially for small and medium-sized firms, which did not
have the managerial resources to deal directly with trade unions.
Recognition by an employers' organisation probably helped unions
recruit and maintain membership for it was more likely to convince
reluctant employers and spread union coverage wider. Turner in his study
of the cotton unions, for example, concluded that recognition through
an association assured higher levels and stability of membership than
would otherwise have been the case in that industry.[82] However, this
method of dealing with trade unions through an association also tended
to confirm and extend multi-unionism in British industry. In other words,


-----

The management of labour in the nineteenth century 33

when national recognition was conceded to different unions, it became
incumbent on all member firms to accept such unions if they obtained
a presence in their workplace. In engineering, for example, from 1898
onwards federated firms were obliged to accept the unions which had
been recognised at national level and failure to do so could lead to
expulsion from the Federation.[83] Thus employer policies, though they
did not create the potential for multi-unionism, did much to sustain it.
As we will see later, in the longer term multi-unionism created problems
for British employers.

**Employers and collective bargaining**

During the years of prosperity of the mid-Victorian period, craft workers
and their unions developed and enforced trade practices on employers,
covering matters such as apprenticeship, deployment of workers, over-
time working, and the use of piece work. Along with this, they sought
to impose wage increases unilaterally throughout a district. Beginning
in the 1860s and increasingly in the 1870s, as trade turned down and
concern about foreign competition grew, employers in some industries
tried to establish more regular and formal collective bargaining arrange-
ments. This was done through employers' associations and involved the
creation of so-called conciliation boards for fixing wages and conditions
and handling disputes. There were many examples, but the best known
were in hosiery, building, and certain coalfields and iron-making dis-
tricts.[84]

Such arrangements were usually locally based, covering a town or
district which suited a situation where labour and product markets were
still often local in scope. At first the codes of wages and conditions which
were created were minimal in nature. Wages were based on the rate for
the job in the local labour market and adjusted automatically according
to a sliding scale based on external fluctuations in the selling price of
the product. This usually entailed only additions to or subtractions from
key rates. In other words, the agreements did not create detailed wage
structures and it was left to the individual firms to fill the gaps. The main
initiative for these schemes seems to have come from the employers. It
is true that the unions and their members gained certain advantages,
especially formal recognition and a floor of basic wages and conditions.
On the other hand, the unions were expected to abide by the formal
agreements and assert discipline over their members. The employers used
these collective bargaining arrangements in the 1870s and 1880s to assert
greater control and contain restrictive craft practices. By taking disputed
issues to joint boards, where employers could mobilise their collective


-----

strength, they hoped to check such practices and enforce precedents
favourable to themselves. In some cases local wage agreements served
to reduce competition between firms and long-term sliding scale arrange-
ments gave the employers some wage predictability.[85]

A further stage in the development of collective bargaining occurred
in the 1890s and 1900s when a combination of circumstances provided
a new stimulus. By that time, some of the older arrangements had broken
down and in the 1890s workers used the improved economic circumst-
ances to re-impose restrictive job controls. This coincided with a re-
newed concern about foreign competition and a period of accelerated
technological change in industries such as engineering, shipbuilding, and
footwear. Again, when the opportunity occurred, employers took the
initiative, increasingly acting at an industry-wide level through their
associations. In coal mining, for example, a Wages Board covering the
Miners' Federation was established in 1893 and by stages slowly extended
throughout the British coalfields. In the same year, in cotton spinning,
after a major employers' lock-out, a national disputes' procedure was
established under the so-called Brooklands Agreement. In the footwear
industry, again after a lock-out asserting managements' rights, a national
procedural agreement was established in 1895. The most famous pro-
cedure, however, was that created in engineering after the historic 1897-8
lock-out.[86] This created arrangements which were emulated by other
employers and which were to last in engineering into the 1970s. The
agreement contained a formal statement of management's right to
manage; a procedure was established under which disputes could be
taken from the factory to regional and national employers' panels; while
disputes were going through the procedure management had the right
to introduce changes and the union was obliged to refrain from strike
action. The procedure thus provided a mechanism for settling disputes
and making agreements. It was also intended to contain workforce trade
union activity and to enable the full power of the organised employers
to be mobilised in defence of points of principle.[87]

Following on the creation of these procedures, there was also from
the 1890s a slow growth of national agreements on wages and conditions.
In cotton weaving the first national wage agreement was established in
1892 and in cotton spinning the number of local piecework price lists
was reduced to two, which from 1906 were adjusted simultaneously. A
1904 agreement in coal mining introduced the practice of national percen-
tage changes to district base rates. In the following year the first national
wages agreement was concluded in iron and steel and in 1907 national
wage bargaining was introduced in shipbuilding.[88] Thus, by 1910 a Report
on Collective Agreements could conclude that, There is manifested a


-----

The management of labour in the nineteenth century 35

tendency to supersede narrow wage scales by lists having a wider applica-
tion, shop lists being absorbed in local lists, and local lists in uniform
lists whose operation is coterminous with that of organisations by
employers.'[89]

Again, trade unions and their members gained certain advantages from
the development of national wage agreements, extending a floor of basic
wages and conditions over a broader geographical area. Simultaneously,
however, these arrangements also restricted unions, especially under
long-term agreements and during prosperous periods. For the employers
they also imposed basic obligations of recognition and collective bargain-
ing. However, in the employers' case, these were outweighed by consider-
able advantages: they prevented attempts by trade unions unilaterally to
impose wages and to leapfrog claims between firms, and, in some indus-
tries, they also served to reduce or control competition by removing
wages from contention between firms.[90]

Thus, by the turn of the century, collective bargaining arrangements
had been created in a number of major British industries. These were
based on organisation among employers which slowly developed from
local to regional and finally to national level. However, it should be
added that this externalised system provided only a minimal framework
of wages and conditions and did not altogether displace craft control
and workshop bargaining. Such practices persisted and re-emerged peri-
odically, when market conditions were favourable, to challenge the
stability of formal collective agreements. As will be shown later, this was
to be a distinctive feature of British industrial relations in the twentieth
century. The state played a part in the creation of these systems in that
it encouraged machinery designed to promote voluntary conciliation
practices.[91] The unions played a more important role in the creation of
these systems, both through direct initiation and indirectly through the
pressure they put on employers. However, the main initiative came from
the employers who, through their associations, laid the foundations for
the fuller development of industry-wide collective bargaining in the
twentieth century.

**Conclusions**

The legacy from the nineteenth century was to have a profound effect
on the development of labour management in twentieth-century Britain.
The context was a structure of small and medium-sized firms, operating
in highly diversified product markets. Britain's fledgling large firms were
mainly loose holding companies, slow to develop tighter structures and
extensive managerial hierarchies. In the final quarter of the nineteenth

century, competitive pressures increased both at home and abroad, but
simultaneously there was a rise in collusive market behaviour. In many
sectors of the economy traditional work methods persisted or changed
only slowly, reflecting the structure of markets, the nature of firms, and
a failure to invest. In a few industries in the late nineteenth century there
were the beginnings of a change towards new methods of mass produc-
tion, though this was not to be fully realised until the twentieth century.
In this context, and in a situation of relatively elastic labour supply, the
predominant pattern of employment relations in British industry was
one characterised by minimal commitment on the part of both employers
and workers to one another, and only a few exceptional firms had
developed more extensive internal labour market type arrangements. In
industrial relations, many British employers had recognised trade unions
and were beginning to create collective bargaining systems based on
membership of employers' organisations and industry-wide agreements
outside the firm. The predominant pattern of labour management was,
therefore, one of reliance on external market methods of coordination
rather than the development of strong internal systems.

### 3 Markets, firms, and the organisation of production

This chapter surveys the economic and business context within which
British employers managed their labour force from the turn of the century
to the Second World War. It stresses the major market fluctuations which
resulted in dramatic shifts in the balance of power between employers
and their employees. The chapter considers changes in market structure,
in particular the growth of restrictive and protectionist practices which
contributed to the maintenance of the traditional pattern of labour
management. The period also saw a significant growth of large firms,
especially in the newer sectors of industry; however, changes in corporate
structure and managerial hierarchy came only very slowly and this
inhibited the development of labour management. Finally the chapter
deals with the management of production. Though there were important
changes in production methods, there was also considerable continuity
in work organisation and traditional patterns of work relations remained
strong in many industries.

**Economic conditions of war and depression**

The early years of the twentieth century saw a continuation of the
relatively poor economic performance of the British economy which had
first become evident in the late nineteenth century. In the Edwardian
period up to the First World War, there was a sharp deceleration of
growth in output, industrial productivity, and incomes. Investment over-
seas yielded higher returns than capital invested in British industry and
Britain's share of world manufacturing output and trade fell.[1] It is not
surprising that in these circumstances concern about foreign competition
grew and anxieties about Britain's ability to meet the challenge mounted.[2]

The First World War hastened some trends and retarded others. It
stimulated growth in newer industries, such as chemicals and electrical
engineering, but it also brought new growth in the older staple industries
such as coal, iron and steel, and shipbuilding. One major result of the
war was that Britain ceased to be the centre of the world's trading network

and many of Britain's export markets contracted as countries formerly
dependent on its goods either sought alternative sources of supply or
began to replace imports. This highlighted a problem, the early signs of
which were discernible in the late nineteenth century, namely the declin-
ing competitiveness and vulnerability of British manufacturers in world
markets.[3]

The economic history of the interwar years saw some of the most
severe fluctuations ever in British industrial history. Britain emerged from
the First World War into a short boom and the continuation of wartime
full employment. However, in 1920, the boom broke, leading to one of
the worst depressions in British history. Industrial production fell by
nearly 20 per cent and exports by 30 per cent and by spring 1921
unemployment in the insured trades had reached 15 per cent, with much
higher levels in the staple industries.[4] Between 1922 and 1929, there was
an unsteady upswing. However, the recovery of the 1920s was not as
strong as in other countries, and unemployment stuck at around 10 per
cent of the insured workforce. The return to gold at the high pre-war
parity in 1925 placed British manufacturing industry at a cost disadvan-
tage in world markets.[5] In the collapse of the world economy following
the American slump in 1929, Britain moved into a second severe
depression. In the years up to 1932 industrial production fell by one
tenth; private sector investment dropped by a quarter; and exports fell
by one third. In 1932 the number of insured unemployed rose to 23 per
cent of the insured workforce. However, as the downturn was from a
lower level in relation to productive capacity than in other countries, the
British depression of the 1930s was less severe and destabilising. Though
there were some cuts in money wages, these were not as great as in
1920-21 and, largely because of an improvement in the terms of trade
and falling prices, the real wages of those in work actually rose.[6]

After the financial and political crisis of 1931, and with the advent of
a serious balance of payments deficit, Britain came off the gold standard
and introduced tariff protection. Along with cheaper money, rising real
incomes, and a boom in housebuilding, these measures helped to promote
the upswing which took place between 1932 and 1937. Over these years,
industrial production and gross investment each rose by around 45 per
cent.[7] In absolute terms, economic activity in 1937 reached a higher level
than in the previous peaks of 1913 and 1929. Exports slowly picked up,
though much of the recovery was due to rising domestic demand. At the
peak of the recovery in the third quarter of 1937 unemployment fell to
just under 10 per cent of the insured workforce. To put this in perspective,
growth rates in the 1920s were better than in the decade immediately
before the war, though relative to many other major industrial countries,


-----

they were still poor. However, during the recovery of the 1930s the
situation was reversed and Britain's productivity performance improved
markedly. Rates of growth in that decade were probably higher than at
any period since the middle decades of the nineteenth century and were
better than in most other countries. During these years and indeed up
until 1950, Britain began to catch up after years of falling behind.[8]

It has already been stressed in the previous chapter that historically
the British labour market was characterised by a relatively elastic supply
of labour, both unskilled and skilled. This continued throughout the
period of the interwar years. Unemployment rarely fell below 10 per cent
of the insured labour force and, even in the best years, there remained
a hardcore of about one million insured workers without jobs, concen-
trated mainly in the staple industries of shipbuilding, cotton textiles, iron
and steel, and mechanical engineering and in the coalfield areas of
England, Scotland and Wales. Because of deficiencies in data and wide-
spread underemployment in earlier periods, it is difficult to make com-
parisons. However, over the period 1870-1914, the level of unemployment
probably averaged over 5 per cent; even during the best years of the
interwar period, 1929 and 1937, it was double that figure; by contrast,
in the first twenty years after the Second World War unemployment
averaged only 1.5 per cent.[9] In these circumstances, British employers
found themselves in a buyer's market for labour, and this had profound
consequences for the employment policies which they adopted.
Behind these macroeconomic movements were important changes in
the structure and organisation of British industry - the rise of newer
industries, the increase in product market collusion, the advent of protec-
tionism, and the growth of concentration. All had important implications
for the management of labour and will be considered below.

**Changes in market structure**

The interwar years witnessed important changes but also significant
continuities in the structure of British industry. Before the First World
War, Britain had been less successful than the US and Germany in
establishing itself in some of the newer industries such as electrical
engineering, motor vehicles, and chemicals. The war itself stimulated
production in these areas and in the 1920s and 1930s motor vehicles,
electrical products, the newer branches of chemicals, artificial fibres, and
food processing expanded rapidly. On the other hand, the older staple
industries - coal, textiles, shipbuilding, iron and steel, and the traditional
branches of engineering - declined during the interwar years, being badly
hit by growing self-sufficiency elsewhere and tariffs and by the emergence

of more efficient competitors. Yet, still up to the Second World War,
Britain remained heavily committed to these older industries which
continued to account for a substantial proportion of output and
employment.[10]

In Chapter 1 it was suggested that the level of demand, the degree of
competition and collusion, and the boundaries of the market were impor-
tant factors influencing the labour activities of the firm. Before the First
World War Britain was an open economy subject to increasing competi-
tion from American and continental manufacturers. After the war, with
the advent of depression in 1920, there was a scramble for orders and
an increase in competitive pressures both at home and overseas. In many
sectors American goods were highly competitive; continental producers
re-emerged more quickly than had been foreseen; and in the Far East
Japanese competition became apparent for the first time.[11] However, one
of the striking features of the interwar years was an increase in collusive
practices of various kinds. Both in terms of formal trade associations
and informal restrictive practices, collusion increased during the First
World War, encouraged by the rationing of raw materials and government
controls.[12] As the 1918 Report of the Committee on Trusts stated, 'there
is at the present time in every branch of industry in the UK an increasing
tendency to the formation of trade associations and combinations, having
for their purpose the restriction of competition and the control of prices'.[13]

As demand fell with the onset of depression, some trade associations
collapsed and others loosened their restrictive practices. However, this
was often only an initial reaction to the appearance of excess capacity,
and mutual adversity soon led to renewed collusion.[14] Thus, in 1929,
another government committee remarked on 'the tendency for separate
productive undertakings to associate themselves with other enterprises
with a view to regulating output, prices, and other matters'.[15] From the
1930s onwards, there were additional factors which made collusion more
effective. The merger wave and increase in concentration which occurred
in the 1920s made it possible in some industries for a few bigger firms
to collude. The adoption of protection in the early 1930s reduced the
threat of import competition and thus strengthened cartel arrangements
in the home market. The state, which had since the late nineteenth century
tolerated restrictive agreements, took a more positive attitude towards
them and was more prepared to give support to attempts to control
capacity and fix output quotas. This trend continued through the Second
World War.[16]

Throughout most of the nineteenth century, the boundaries of product
markets had been extending, largely as a result of better communications
and lower transportation costs. Working against these broadening tenden-

ties, however, were countervailing political factors leading to trade
restrictions. During the interwar years there was a rapid growth in
protectionism throughout the world. The erection of tariff barriers over-
seas not only raised the competitive hurdle for British manufacturers
and increased rivalry in third-country markets but also threatened to
increase competition in Britain's home market, since, throughout the
1920s, while some individual industries and products were given tariff
support, Britain remained one of the most open markets in the world.
However, this openness slowly changed. The First World War had seen
the introduction of duties on motor cars, cycles, and other 'luxury' goods.
Protection for certain chemicals and other 'key industries' was also
introduced during and after the war. For other products, protection was
introduced under 'safeguarding' legislation in 1921 and 1925. Pressure
for protection mounted from businessmen, especially in iron and steel,
shipbuilding, and engineering. However, it was not until the crisis of
1931 and the emergence of a large balance of payments deficit that Britain
introduced a general system of tariffs which was later elaborated into a
complex system of imperial preferences aimed at expanding trade within
the Empire.[17]

Protection had various effects. On the one hand, it created a more
assured home market, helped business confidence, and stimulated domes-
tic production. On the other hand, it limited exports and redirected trade
towards imperial markets. By the Second World War Britain had reduced
her trade with Europe and the US and had increased her reliance on
Empire and Dominion markets. On the whole, these markets were smaller,
less sophisticated, and constituted a fragmented total market. They were
also growing more slowly than the markets of the US and Europe and
in the case of the Dominions and India were in the longer term to
industrialise in precisely those areas where Britain supplied them with
products.[18] Together protection and collusion created softer markets and
allowed inefficiencies of various kinds, including labour inefficiencies.
One report in 1944 concluded that the growth of collusion was 'one of
the most significant economic developments of the last quarter of a
century' and added that 'the proliferation of trade associations is one of
the major reasons why the efficiency of British industry lags behind that
of the United States'.[19] It will also be argued in Chapter Five that
protection and collusion also encouraged the growth and stability of
multi-employer, industry collective bargaining in Britain.

**Corporate structure and organisation**

In the previous chapter it was stressed that the typical Victorian firm was


-----

small or medium sized, usually had one single factory, and was owner
controlled. A combination of internal growth and the turn of the century
merger wave saw the emergence of a large firm sector in British manufac-
turing before the First World War. However, these firms were often
created for defensive, market-control reasons rather than in the interests
of greater efficiency and the firms tended to remain loosely coordinated
federations with little development of professional management.
Concentration in industry increased rapidly in the 1920s both as
measured by concentration in particular industries and by the share of
the largest 100 industrial companies in total output and market valuation.
Before the First World War the largest manufacturing firm in Britain in
terms of assets was the sewing-thread maker J. & P. Coats with a market
value of Â£45 million; by 1930 five more companies - Unilever, Imperial
Tobacco, ICI, Courtaulds, and Distillers - exceeded that value, and in
the case of the first three by a very substantial margin. In terms of
employment there was also a marked shift towards larger firms. Before
the war the largest manufacturing employer was Fine Cotton Spinners
and Doublers with around 30,000 employees. By the 1930s there were
at least ten manufacturing firms employing this number or more and the
largest of them, Unilever, ICI, and GKN, employed 50,000 or more; in
total nearly 1.7 million worked in the 135 largest industrial firms employ-
ing 5,000 or more workers.[20]

Growth in firm size came in part from internal expansion of firms.
However, a significant proportion of the increase in the size of British
firms in the decade after the First World War came from mergers. It has
been calculated that, for manufacturing industries, three quarters of the
increase in concentration was due to mergers. In the 1920s nearly two
thousand firms were absorbed in mergers and acquisitions and these
mergers accounted for about one third of total investment expenditure
in manufacturing industry.[21]

The reasons for mergers and the growth in concentration were complex.
The end of the war encouraged some firms such as Vickers and Nobels
to diversify out of armaments and acquire firms in other sectors. In the
1920s there was a shift in opinion away from a belief in the merits of
small-firm competition towards a belief in so-called 'rationalisation' and
the advantages of larger-scale enterprise. The continued conversion of
many private firms into joint stock companies and the growth of the
stock exchange also provided the opportunity and financial means for
growth and merger.[22] Most important, however, were the market threats
and opportunities of the period. On the one hand shrinking markets in
the 1920s and the presence of growing foreign competition posed a threat
to British manufacturers which led to defensive mergers. On the other,


-----

Markets, firms, and the organisation of production 45

there was after the war more recognition of the opportunities offered by
product and technical innovation and by economies of scale and
marketing.
Though the growth in concentration affected most industries, it was
most pronounced in the newer expanding sectors. Thus ICI, formed in
1926 from the four largest firms in the chemical industry, controlled more
than one third of UK chemical output. Between them GEC, English
Electric, and Associated Electrical Industries dominated the electrical
engineering industry. Areas of food, drink, and tobacco became highly
concentrated and dominated by a few large companies - Unilever, Ranks
and Spillers, Cadbury-Fry and Rowntrees, Reckitts & Colman, Distillers,
Imperial Tobacco. By contrast, concentration ratios in many of the older
staple industries remained much lower. In coal, textiles, mechanical
engineering, and printing the typical firm remained small. Though there
were mergers in iron and steel and shipbuilding, these industries were
mainly characterised by medium-sized firms, and in the case of iron and
steel, British companies still remained much smaller than their American
and German counterparts.[23]

After 1930, the number of mergers fell in the wake of depression and
the growth in restrictive and protectionist tendencies. However, one
important feature of the 1930s and 1940s was the growth in plant size.
In manufacturing industry the proportion of total employment in big
plants employing more than 1,500 workers rose from 15 per cent in 1935
to 24 per cent in 1951. The percentage in smaller plants (those employing
less than 200) fell proportionately from 44 to 35 per cent. Again the trend
towards larger plants was particularly noticeable in newer sectors such
as motor vehicles, chemicals, and electrical products. Thus, many of the
big firms created in the 1920s began in the 1930s to make larger scale
investment in newer and bigger plants. Yet, as postwar studies were to
show, for the most part, British plants remained smaller than those in
the US and Germany.[24]

**The slowness of organisational change**

The growth of the large firm in the interwar years occasioned a mixed
response in terms of corporate structures. In Chapter 2 it was shown that
the turn of the century mergers resulted, for the most part, in loose,
holding-company type arrangements. In other words, the merged com-
panies failed to develop strong main boards and head offices with
extensive staffs; subsidiary companies remained relatively autonomous
and continued to be managed by their previous owners; and there was


-----

46 Continuities and change

only a limited development of managerial hierarchies and control sys-
tems.[25] Merger, followed by organisation on these lines, had the advan-
tage of reducing competition, helping control markets, and providing
some economies of scale, while also economising on the costs of organisa-
tion building and of recruiting and training managers. On the other hand,
loose structures prevented the full realisation of organisational economies
of integration and of production economies of scale. This situation
contrasted with the USA and Germany, where larger firms had started
to build new centralised, functionally controlled enterprises and to
develop more extensive managerial hierarchies.[26]

In Britain, after the merger wave of the 1920s most firms continued
to be organised on holding company lines. The autonomy of constituent
enterprises was retained and as a consequence little rationalisation took
place. Competition between subsidiaries continued and, though merged
firms might be under the banner of a larger firm, in practice they retained
considerable autonomy. However, there were some notable exceptions
and some developments in corporate structure in Britain, especially from
the mid-1920s onwards. Some of the largest companies did develop
head-office capability and started to define functional responsibilities
and to develop managerial specialisms.[27] A few even began to experiment
with multidivisional structures, where strategic decisions and the over-
sight of the firm were the responsibility of the main board and senior
headquarters staff, while production and more routine matters were
decentralised to product or geographical divisions. For example, after
its creation in 1926, ICI moved in this direction. Initially it centralised
its organisational structure; directors were given functional
responsibilities; a number of central strategic committees were created;
and an enlarged central office of service departments was established.
At the same time it rationalised its production capacity, closing down
old chemical works and concentrating production on more efficient
plants. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, ICI moved deliberately towards
a more decentralised system of product divisions, each with its own
delegate board responsible for production matters, but subject to the
overall financial and strategic control of head office.[28] A few other
companies such as Unilever, Dunlop, Spillers, and Turner & Newall
moved in the same direction.[29]

A number of factors help to explain this embryonic innovation in
corporate structures in the interwar years as contrasted with the turn of
the century merger wave. There was after the war a greater awareness
among businessmen of the problems and opportunities involved in larger
size. This was reflected in the 'rationalisation' movement, a burgeoning
management literature, and the increased interchange of information and


-----

Markets, firms, and the organisation of production 47

experience between firms.[30] Some stimulus may have been provided by
the American firms which expanded their activities in Britain during the
interwar years and which brought with them new management tech-
niques.[31] Also important was the change in the pattern of mergers, for
in the interwar years there was an increase in merger by diversification
into related areas and this created a need for new, more complex struc-
tures.
Overall, however, organisational innovation came slowly in Britain.
In 1939 the majority of Britain's largest firms were organised on tradi-
tional holding-company lines. Though a growing number were developing
some form of centralised organisation with functionally specialised
departments at headquarters level, often these firms contained elements
of holding-company arrangements. Even as late as 1950 only about a
dozen firms had adopted a multidivisional form of organisation and the
majority of these were subsidiaries of American or other foreign com-
panies.[32] In some industries firms were particularly slow in moving
beyond the holding-company form of organisation. Prominent among
these were firms in the engineering sector. For example, the largest
engineering firm at the end of the First World War was Vickers, with its
origins in iron and steel, armaments, and shipbuilding. In 1901 it had
diversified into motor cars with the acquisition of Wolseley and after the
war it acquired British Westinghouse & Carriage Co. which had itself
acquired British Westinghouse Electrical & Manufacturing Co. However,
it attempted to run its extensive and diverse operations on holding-
company lines. In part as a result of this it ran into difficulties and in
the late 1920s sold off its motor car, electrical engineering, and special
metals interests.[33] Other examples of engineering firms which failed to
develop beyond the holding-company form were Armstrong Whitworth,
John Brown, Associated Electrical Industries, Birmingham Small Arms,
Tube Investments, Hawker Siddeley, and GKN.[34] The leading British-
owned motor-car companies, Morris, Austin, and Rootes, remained under
one-man control and similarly failed to develop fully integrated, well-
organised structures.
Chandler has contrasted the speed with which American and British
firms developed new organisational forms and has explained this in large
part in terms of the persistence of conservative family management in
Britain.[35] Certainly the boardrooms of many British companies remained
dominated by family members. Merger with other companies might bring
representatives of other families on to the new main board, while at the
subsidiary level allowing the old family to retain a substantial degree of
control. Such vested interest inhibited the rationalisation of capacity and
of company structure and retarded the introduction of professional

management into the higher reaches of many firms.[36] Other factors,
however, were more important in encouraging the holding-company
form. Even the largest British companies were smaller than their
American counterparts and perhaps had less need for the more formalised
and bureaucratic structures that American firms were developing. Domes-
tic British markets were smaller than those in the US and as a result
more efficient in terms of distribution. It was therefore less pressing to
develop structures and hierarchies to handle marketing and distribution.
In addition, the less standardised nature of British markets and the
strength of brand loyalties often encouraged the maintenance of a range
of competing products within a company. Protection and collusion prob-
ably also played a part in reducing the pressure for better forms of
organisation. In the longer term, failure to create efficient administrative
structures and managerial hierarchies meant an inability to take full
advantage of coordination and of production economies of scale and
had important implications for the management of labour.

**Managerial hierarchies**

During the first half of the twentieth century there was an increase in
the number of managerial and related staff in British industry. In 1907
the proportion of administrative, technical, and clerical employees in
manufacturing industry constituted 8 per cent of the workforce. By the
mid-1930s this had risen to 15 per cent and by 1948 to 20 per cent. Most
of this increase came in the 1930s and 1940s and brought Britain closer
to American and German levels.[37] Along with an increase in the number
of managers and support staff went an increase in functional specialisa-
tion. Older established functions such as works engineering and account-
ing grew as did newer ones such as design, sales and marketing, distribu-
tion, time study, and personnel.[38] In this respect, there was a growing
sophistication in managerial hierarchies in Britain, especially in bigger
firms in newer industries. However, a number of important qualifications
need to be added. First, as has already been suggested, family control
and management remained stronger in Britain than in either the US or
Germany. Key managerial positions were usually reserved for family
members and firms paid less attention to recruiting and developing their
salaried managers. Second, at a time when a growing proportion of
American, German, and Japanese managers were receiving a training,
often at university level, in applied technical and business subjects, only
a small minority of senior British managers were similarly qualified. At
the higher reaches of management in large firms the 'gentleman amateur'


-----

Markets, firms, and the organisation of production 49

was a common type, while at middle and lower levels the 'practical man',
who possessed little in the way of formal qualifications, remained
dominant.[39] A third weakness was that British managerial hierarchies
were often not particularly well integrated. The growth of functional
specialisms and the increasing divide between top (often family) manage-
ment and lower level line management led to an increased stratification
and segmentation of managerial hierarchies.[40] In the large firm, directors
and top management, with their liberal education, constituted an elite
of 'general' management, distanced from lower level line management
with their more 'practical' training and 'shop' approach. Likewise, the
small, though growing number of scientists and technologists were often
cut off from line management and both top management and specialists
alike were often divorced from the manufacturing process proper. In
production areas management was particularly weak: it was here that
'practical' managers predominated and traditional foremen, largely
untrained in management, continued to enjoy considerable discretion
and represented a traditional pattern of authority and control at work-
place level.[41]

In the area of labour management there was an elaboration of
hierarchy. The First World War had encouraged the growth of 'welfare
work' within British industry to deal with recruitment, record keeping,
and canteens and recreational facilities. The number of full-time welfare
specialists grew from under 100 before the war to over 1,000 in 1918.
After the war there was some reduction in numbers, as firms were relieved
of wartime regulations and, with the onset of depression, began to cut
back on staff. However, through the 1930s the numbers increased again
and by 1939 there were around 2,000 managers engaged full-time on
labour matters. This number increased during the Second World War to
around 5,000.[42] What had been called 'welfare work', often carried out
by female staff of relatively low status in the management hierarchy,
increasingly came to be called 'labour management' or 'employment
management' or 'personnel management' and the work came to be carried
out by male managers of higher status. Probably the first department
actually called an 'Employment Department' was established by the large
progressive Manchester engineering firm of Renold Chains in 1909.[43]

Other companies, including Brunner Mond, followed suit during the
First World War. In larger firms the work was often divided into welfare,
covering recruitment, record keeping, health and safety, and recreational
activities, and industrial relations, covering trade unions and wage bar-
gaining matters.[44]

There was no obvious source of recruitment for these new personnel
managers and very few firms had management training programmes to


-----

50 Continuities and change

develop them. Companies therefore often relied on recruiting from else-
where. Some of the early personnel managers came from government
service: R.L. Roberts who established ICI's Labour Department, for
example, had worked for the Post Office and had helped to run labour
exchanges.[45] Others came from academic or consultancy backgrounds
and a few had worked in America: thus C.H. Northcott, the labour
manager at Rowntrees from the mid-1920s onwards, had worked as a
consultant in the US and A. Shaw, who joined Metropolitan Vickers in
the early 1930s, had also worked in the US in the time-study area.[46] The
increasing specialisation in personnel management was reflected in the
establishment of professional associations and a burgeoning literature.
The first Welfare Workers Association was established in 1913 and had
developed by 1931 into the Institute of Labour Management and by 1946
the Institute of Personnel Management. In related areas the Institute of
Cost and Works Accountants was founded in 1919 and the Institute of
Industrial Administration in 1920. These were followed in the 1930s by
the Works Managers Association and the Office Managers Association.[47]

However, it is important not to exaggerate the sophistication of labour
management in Britain at this time. Even by the end of the Second World
War, most big firms did not have central personnel or industrial relations
departments. Most personnel managers continued to be promoted up
through the pay or records office or were recruited from among line
managers and supervisors. At the level of subsidiary companies and
individual plants, labour matters were left to incumbent managers who
in turn often delegated to middle-level line managers and foremen. Of
course it was natural that a large part of labour matters should be left
to line managers. But, in effect, given the loose corporate structures and
the continuation of traditional patterns of command, this often meant a
lack of planning and coordination of labour management.

**Work relations and the organisation of production**

It was argued in Chapter 2 that change in work organisation came slowly
in late-nineteenth-century Britain and, in many sectors of industry, tradi-
tional, unskilled-labour and craft-intensive methods remained strong.
This was not least because the majority of British firms, small and medium
in size, lacked the financial and organisational resources to push through
a thorough transformation of their production systems. It also made
sense for them to use the plentiful and versatile skills of the labour force
in the production of a wide range of goods for the many varied markets
which British industry served. As the official history of the wartime
munitions industry during the war put it, 'It would probably be true to


-----

Markets, firms, and the organisation of production 51

say that no country in the world could show such a high level of
workmanship, or so much out-of-date machinery.'[48] It is true that, in the
late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, there had been significant
changes in some industries with the introduction of new methods and
processes which made possible a greater subdivision of work and the
gradual replacement of skilled men by less skilled workers. Along with
this, in the early years of the twentieth century, there had been some
development of indigenous thinking on the theory and practice of
management and a growing interest in new American ideas of 'scientific
management.
The First World War, with the large demand for munitions and general
supplies, had an important effect, especially on the metal-working indus-
tries. New factories were built, existing factories extended, and new
machinery and processes were introduced. In the engineering industry,
for example, there was an increased installation of machine tools such
as turret lathes, capstan lathes, and universal milling machines, many
imported from the US. As demand grew and skill shortages increased,
the tendency was to install automatic machine tools which could be used
by semi- and unskilled workers and more extensive use was also made
of gauges and jigs of various kinds which enabled such workers to perform
more complicated jobs. In addition, there were improvements in factory
layout, planning and costing, and the Government encouraged the stan-
dardisation of components and products.[50] Also, during the war the
consumption of electricity doubled and this offered employers the oppor-
tunity to redesign factory lay-out and to control more closely the pace
of operations.[51] In addition, wartime agreements between union leaders
and the government, later backed up by legislation, permitted the employ-
ment of semi-skilled workers on work hitherto the preserve of skilled
men. The legislation made it illegal to obstruct methods aimed at increas-
ing war production or to maintain practices which might adversely affect
output.[52] In these circumstances, new methods were introduced and a
greater subdivision of labour occurred; dilution, or the substitution of
skilled craftsmen by unskilled and semi-skilled workers, gradually
increased.[53]

However, in practice, changes in production were less thoroughgoing
than is sometimes suggested. In 1917 the President of the Institute of
Mechanical Engineers argued that, 'Except in a few cases, workshop
organisation here has not received the attention given it in America or
Germany. There are still shops without definite planning of the progress
of the work, without adequate equipment of jigs and gauges, and without
standard shapes of tools or a toolroom; where men drift about in search
of tools or tackle, or wait in idleness for drawings and material; where


-----

52 Continuities and change

machinery is obsolete and light so bad that good work could not be done
if the machinery were up to date.'[54] The exceptional circumstances mainly
affected the munitions industries and the production of large quantities
of standardised goods such as armaments. The wartime legislation did
not apply to private work and, when dilution was attempted, it met with
shopfloor resistance.[55] Moreover, dilution was not as extensive as is
sometimes suggested. Women were rarely substituted for skilled men and
were usually put onto already subdivided jobs. In heavy engineering and
shipbuilding, they were little used. Even the upgrading of semi-skilled
men to skilled status seems to have been quite rare, amounting to only
about 4 per cent of all changes in working practices.[56] For the most part,
skilled craftsmen possessed real skills which, in many jobs, could not be
replaced by diluted labour. Also it should be remembered that the whole
point of replacing skilled men by dilution was usually to upgrade them
to the more skilled jobs of tool-setting and supervision.
During the war trade unions enjoyed an extremely strong position in
a very tight labour market and, in these circumstances, they could and
did resist management changes. The legislation which employers could
have used to force changes in production was in fact seldom employed.
Moreover, it could be a double-edged weapon for employers since it
obliged them to consult with unions and guaranteed that wartime changes
in the organisation of work would be of a temporary nature.[57] This
increased the hesitancy of employers and strengthened the resolve of
workers. As Reid has suggested, British employers did not enthusiastically
embrace dilution or work reorganisation. 'With a few exceptions, British
employers stubbornly maintained conservative attitudes and had little
faith in the proposals to rationalise labour-intensive methods of produc-
tion. Indeed, it was frequently managements which put up the strongest
opposition to dilution, because each firm wanted to retain as much skilled
labour as possible.'[58]

At the end of the war, a Board of Trade report, while suggesting that
some British firms were as good as any in the world, concluded more
generally: There can be no doubt that many of our older works are
manufacturing at costs which could be greatly reduced if their works as
a whole were on a larger scale, better planned and equipped with plant
and therefore capable of being worked in the most efficient and economi-
cal manner.'[59] In drawing the contrast with the US and Germany, it
attributed much of this to the conservatism of the British manufacturer
and the existence of a large number of medium and small firms, 'each
with a separate organisation, separate establishment charges, separate
buying and selling arrangements, and each producing a multiplicity of
articles. Some of them seem to take a special pride in the number of


-----

Markets, firms, and the organisation of production 53

things they turn out.'[60] In the circumstances of the postwar boom, most
employers, wishing to take advantage of market opportunities and prefer-
ring to avoid trouble with their unions, chose to retain traditional
methods.[61] According to the Webbs, after the war, 'British employers
did not set themselves to apply mass production to the making of engines
and motor cars, agricultural implements and machinery generally, nor
make any dramatic advances in its application to the production of
sewing machines, bicycles and electrical apparatus.'[62]

With the onset of depression from 1920 onwards, employers were
confronted by the threat of greater competition and the opportunity of
reduced union power. Their first reaction was to dismiss workers, reduce
manning levels, and cut wages. A subsequent reaction was to re-assert
managerial prerogatives against the trade unions. In part these offensives
attempted to facilitate changes in production techniques and work organi-
sation; to a greater extent, however, they were aimed at increasing
management control and intensifying work within existing technologies.
One of the most dramatic was in engineering, where in 1922 the Engineer-
ing Employers Federation (EEF) locked out all the unions in the industry
over the question of management's right to organise production.[63] The
employers were determined to show that in areas of work organisation
there could be no 'dual control or veto on management'.[64] The lock-out
lasted three months and ended with the unions returning to work on the
employers' terms. In coal mining, confronted by declining international
competitiveness, the employers sought to restore their position by a more
extensive use of labour and, after their victory in 1926, forced longer
hours on the coal miners. In the early 1930s, in another major confronta-
tion over work organisation, the cotton employers sought to increase the
number of looms worked by each weaver from four to eight. In this case
the dispute ended in a compromise and weavers agreed to work six looms
but to do less cleaning.[65]

Overall, during the depressed years of the 1920s and 1930s, there was
a tightening of managerial controls and an intensification of work. This
involved a broader reduction of union restrictive practices. One commen-
tator, writing in 1935, could say, 'Restrictive practices imposed by trade
unions are actually fewer than they were, and of less importance.
Employers in a number of industries have referred to conditions in their
fathers' or grandfathers' time, and have admitted that, comparatively,
their own grounds for complaint are small.'[66] However, such a tightening
of managerial control and an intensification of work had limitations.
During the upswing in the 1930s, traditional practices began to creep
back and spread to new sectors such as motor cars and electrical engineer-
ing.[67] The EEF certainly believed this. As early as 1934, for example,


-----

54 Continuities and change

when a shortage of skilled labour was becoming apparent in the Midlands
and the South, the Federation told its members that, The situation calls
for the greatest discretion on the part of managements and makes it most
desirable that firms, before making any serious changes in working
conditions obtaining in their works should give their Local Association
an opportunity of seeing that the change is in such order that no justifiable
objection can be taken to it by the trade unions.'[68]

Littler has suggested that, during the interwar years, 'scientific manage-
ment' played a significant part in restructuring work organisation in
Britain.[69] Before the First World War, there was some knowledge of
scientific management techniques, and new techniques were introduced
such as rate fixing, premium bonus systems, and more specialised forms
of supervision. However, this indigenous British development was largely
_ad hoc and piecemeal. If 'scientific management' is taken to mean_
Taylorism,[70] then, as has already been stated, it had little impact on
British industry before the First World War. True, during the war there
was increased interest in work organisation and factory administration,
with some notions being drawn from scientific management.[71] Again,
during the so-called rationalisation movement of the 1920s, interest grew.
In part drawing inspiration from German industrial organisations and
from American mass production methods, rationalisation meant both
technological reorganisation within the factory and structural reorganisa-
tion of firms and industries as a means to greater efficiency. In the
mid-1920s it was advocated by leading industrialists and management
thinkers and accorded some support by trade union leaders. Insofar as
rationalisation dealt with the reorganisation of work, it did have an
affinity with ideas akin to 'scientific management'. However, in Britain
in the mid-1920s the rationalisation movement was more concerned with
structural and financial reorganisation and it was in this respect that it
had its main impact. By contrast, the movement had little direct effect
on management techniques or on patterns of work organisation in most
firms.[72]

It was only in the late 1920s and especially in the 1930s that scientific
management really began to affect the practice of British industry. Ele-
ments such as time-studied incentive schemes were easily adapted since,
as J.A. Hobson said, for an employer, these made 'sound commonsense'.[73]

Other aspects were clearly allied to an interest in fatigue, welfare, and
psychological aspects of work.[74] A number of prominent individuals
played a part in promoting the ideas and practice of scientific manage-
ment. A. Shaw, for example, had worked with the Gilbreths, the pioneers
of motion study in the US. She introduced motion study into Metropolitan
Vickers' Manchester factory in the early 1930s and subsequently extended

it throughout the AEI company.[75] Bedaux and his consultancy firm,
established in Britain in 1926, was an important channel. The Bedaux
company offered a package of work measurement, job reorganisation,
and incentive wages. In particular, the Bedaux form of scientific manage-
ment was adopted in new light industries such as electrical products,
motor components, mass produced clothing, and food processing and
was used by firms such as Lucas, Wolsey Hosiery, J. Lyons, Huntley &
Palmers, Peak Frean, Unilever, and Kodak.[76]

However, the actual impact of scientific management should not be
exaggerated. Formal scientific management ideas and practices were
introduced by relatively few firms. Though Bedaux was an important
influence, when the TUC conducted a survey in the early 1930s it found
that 91 out of 104 unions contacted had no experience of Bedaux and
5 of those which had encountered the system claimed to have successfully
resisted its introduction.[77] Littler estimates that approximately 250 firms
employed Bedaux consultants during the interwar years.[78] Yet, even in
these firms, Bedaux methods were often introduced into one particular
plant or department and not throughout the whole company. Even then,
resistance by workers to the speed-up, de-skilling, and job loss which
they feared, often led to it being suspended or modified. As important
in slowing down the introduction of scientific management was hesitancy
on the part of management: top management was often not prepared to
invest in new production systems and line managers and foremen were
often less than enthusiastic about systems which they felt threatened
their traditional position.[79] During the Second World War, there was a
greater extension of time and motion study, but on the whole its introduc-
tion in the interwar years was slow and piecemeal and its effect on British
industry was limited.

**Technical innovation, work organisation, and productivity**

One major technical change in the early twentieth century, affecting
almost the whole of manufacturing industry, was the spread of electricity
as the main source of motive power. Electrification removed some of the
constraints on factory organisation, permitting the use of machines with
their own power source, the more efficient arrangement of machinery,
and a faster and more regular organisation of production.[80] Other tech-
nical changes and resultant changes in work organisation were greatest
in the newer industries. In motor vehicles and electrical products, for
example, there was an increased use of special purpose machine tools
which could be operated at faster speeds and by semi- and unskilled
labour. In assembly areas, changes were most dramatic because it was


-----

56 Continuities and change

here that the main advances were made in assembly-line methods. The
elements of flow-line production (standardised parts, the arrangement
of machines and work operations sequentially rather than by type or
function, and the transfer of materials and parts by conveyors) had
existed earlier,[81] but in the interwar years these were used on a larger
scale and became a more established feature of work organisation. In
turn, the introduction of assembly lines made management rethink the
division of labour and replan the manner in which work was done. In
particular they offered management greater control over the speed of
operations, curtailed the mobility of workers by tying them down to
individual work stations, and encouraged a greater subdivision of work.[82]

In the chemical and related industries, there were also significant
technological innovations and changes in work organisation. Most impor-
tant were the scaling-up of operations, the development of flow processes,
and the introduction of more sophisticated instrumentation to monitor
and control production. This reflected a move towards more synthetic
reactions and catalytic conversions and a shift from batch production to
semi-continuous and continuous processes. ICI, with its size and growing
corporate capability, was a leader and was able to undertake investment
on a massive scale, including the expansion of the Billingham complex
where nitrogen fertiliser was produced using high-pressure chemical
technology.[83] The implications of these changes for work were that much
heavy manual labour was reduced and more accurate control methods
replaced rule of thumb and worker control over the production process.
However, it should be remembered that much of the work in the chemical
industry was already semi- or unskilled and that new processes created
new skills and put some workers into strategic positions.
In the new consumer goods industries there was also technological
innovation. In food processing, automation and instrumentation
increased in flour milling, biscuit baking, jam making, and canning, with
the introduction, especially in the 1930s, of semi-continuous processes,
conveyor belts, and new packaging machines.[84] In the new synthetic
fibres industry the use by Courtaulds and British Celanese of continuous
process systems and automatic methods of mass production led to an
expansion of semi-skilled work and an increase in female employment.[85]

In parts of the clothing industry, as a mass market developed, there was
also rapid technological change. Sewing machines, conveyor belts, and
flow production became common, especially in the 1930s in the clothing
factories of Leeds and London.[86]

However, in these newer industries changes in production organisation
were often limited. In the motor-car industry, for example, British firms
tended to introduce new machinery in an ad hoc manner and were less


-----

Markets, firms, and the organisation of production 57

thoroughgoing than their American counterparts in linking production
together by assembly-line methods. As a result they established less direct
control over the production process and less machine pacing of work.
In part this may have been because of worker resistance, though from
1920 to the mid-1930s trade unions were not an important factor. Rather
more important, choice of work organisation was determined by the
fragmented nature of British markets, by policies of product differenti-
ation, and by the weakness of managerial hierarchies. British firms relied
more than their American counterparts on labour-intensive methods, and
craft workers maintained an important position in the production process.
As will be argued in the next chapter, British motor manufacturers (with
the exception of Ford) sought to increase productivity by the more
extensive use of piecework systems.[87]

In the 'old' industries, though there was also technological change,
this was less extensive. In the heavy mechanical sectors of engineering,
such as marine, locomotive, and textile machinery, jobs were often one-off
or small batch and traditional methods remained strong.[88] In shipbuild-
ing, the main development was the gradual supersession of hand riveting
by pneumatic riveting and the introduction of electric welding. However,
though welding had been pioneered in Britain, the technique spread only
slowly in comparison with overseas yards. In other respects also the
British shipbuilding industry lagged behind. There was less investment
in power machinery, mechanical handling devices, and prefabrication
and sub-assembly facilities.[89] In iron and steel, during the First World
War, there was a long overdue expansion of basic hearth production
and, during the interwar years, investment in new integrated mills.
However, in Britain investment was often of a patchy nature, extending
the life of existing plant. Much of the British industry remained poorly
equipped, with inadequate furnaces, poor lay-out, and insufficient
mechanical handling devices.[90] In cotton textiles, there was an expansion
of automatic weaving and ring-spinning, both of which were faster and
cheaper than traditional methods. However, even in the late 1930s, only
one-third of Lancashire spindles were of the more modern ring type and
only one-tenth of looms were automatic.[91] In coal mining, mechanical
coal cutters and conveyors were introduced on a larger scale, especially
by a few large firms and in a number of newer pits. Yet, on the eve of
the Second World War, only 60 per cent of coal was cut by machines in
Britain whereas in the US and Germany it was virtually 100 per cent,
and the use of mechanised conveyors was even more limited in Britain.[92]

This description of technical innovation and changes in work organisa-
tion poses three final questions. First, why was change more limited in
some British firms and industries than in others and why was it so often


-----

58 Continuities and change

less than in other major industrial countries such as the US and Germany?
Second, what effect did changes have on control over the labour process?
Third, what effect did the management of work organisation have on
productivity?
Change occurred where there was a certain combination of market
and organisational factors. It occurred in industries which had large and
growing markets, some sheltered from foreign competition either by
protection (cars) or international agreements (chemicals) or being buoyed
up by a growing home consumer demand (processed foodstuffs and
electrical products). These were also industries where a few large firms
had developed which had the organisational and managerial capability
successfully to plan and implement new investment and forms of work
organisation. By comparison with the US and, to some extent, Germany,
there were fewer such firms in Britain. In these industries trade unions
were weak and played little part in obstructing the course of work
innovation. In other industries, such as shipbuilding, cotton, and coal,
trade unions were stronger and their activities may have slowed down
change. However, during most of the interwar years, union power was
greatly reduced. Of much more importance in explaining the slow nature
of change in work organisation was the fact that these were industries
where markets were either very competitive or depressed or fragmented
and where small and medium-sized firms had insufficient capital or
organisational resources successfully to implement major changes. In
these circumstances, firms chose to continue to use the adequate supplies
of labour, which could always be laid off when necessary, and preferred
to pursue a more intensive working of existing technologies. However,
in these industries there were always some exceptions. For example,
some of the larger coal companies which developed new mines in the
eastward extension of the Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, and Scottish
coalfields also introduced newer methods and ways of working.[93] Some
of the larger steel companies, such as United Steel and Stewart & Lloyds,
opened new integrated mills and reorganised their production pro-
cesses.[94]

Braverman argued that employers have pursued strategies of deskilling
aimed at cutting costs and reducing worker control over the production
process. Undoubtedly, over this period, an increased subdivision of work
took place in many industries. At the same time, however, such sub-
division also meant an increase in the complexity of knowledge and
techniques, and work became more specialised. One cannot therefore
conclude that overall skill levels declined. In some cases there may have
been a deskilling and loss of independence such as when new technologies
were introduced in cotton, steel, and coal mining. Often, however, there

was the creation of whole new types of semi-skilled work as in the newer
industries such as motor vehicles and electrical products. The concept
of 'tacit' skills has been used to describe the informal and uncodified
abilities which even unskilled workers often possessed.[95] In other areas
there was undoubtedly an upskilling as in maintenance work. Moreover,
technical changes often maintained or even enhanced the potential for
worker control over the production process. Nor can one conclude that
it was the employers' intention to deskill work in order to reduce worker
control and to maximise profits. In reality employers were concerned
with reducing costs and improving efficiency in many different ways.
This included labour strategies such as wage reductions and the
intensification of work. Change was introduced above all because the
new machines and processes were more efficient and effective. In so far
as labour considerations were important, it was often less the recalcitrance
of labour and more the supply and price of labour which weighed with
employers. It would seem that employers were not driven by a simple
desire to deskill labour, but that technology, markets, and organisational
factors were the paramount influences shaping the organisation of work.
Productivity growth in manufacturing industry slowed before the First
World War and lagged behind other major industrial countries; during
the shake-out of labour in the early 1920s it rose rapidly; the 1930s was
a period when productivity growth again increased and British growth
rates were as high or higher than in other countries. Rising trade union
power may have played some part in lower productivity growth in the
Edwardian period, but a failure of investment, especially in potentially
high-growth sectors such as chemicals, motor vehicles, and electrical
products, was more important.[96] The weakness of unions thereafter may
have been a factor in the higher productivity growth of the interwar
years. In addition, investment in new plant and equipment were important
especially in the newer industries in the 1930s. However, taking the
economy as a whole, through the interwar years, investment was relatively
low and capital output ratios were falling. This would suggest that a
significant part of the increase in productivity must have come from
either a more extensive or more intensive use of labour. Since hours were
reduced after the First World War and since little overtime was worked
during the interwar period,[97] productivity growth cannot have been due
to a more extensive use of labour. It must therefore have been due to
an intensification of work often within largely unchanged technologies.
The demanning of the early 1920s and early 1930s was undoubtedly an
important factor,[98] as were continued fears of unemployment and tighter
management control. Though there were improvements in British produc-
tivity performance, by the late 1930s Britain lagged behind the US and,

in some sectors, Germany." In large part, differences can be explained
by the fact that there were in Britain more old plants using out-of-date
machinery and incorporating traditional working practices. This, in turn,
is to be explained by a combination of factors. Where labour was relatively
expensive, as it was in the USA, the rate of obsolescence of capital was
higher, and firms adjusted more rapidly to newer methods which required
less labour.[100] Where, as again in the USA, markets were larger, the
incentive to introduce large-scale mass production was greater. And
where firms were larger and more centrally coordinated, as they were in
many sectors in the USA and Germany, they were better able to plan
their investment and production strategies.

**Conclusion**

This chapter has outlined the economic and business background
necessary to understand the labour policies and practices of British firms
from the turn of the century to the Second World War. It has stressed
the movement towards larger enterprises, the development of new forms
of organisation, and elaboration of management hierarchies. However,
it has also stressed the slow speed of change and the persistence of older
forms of organisation. There were significant process innovations and
changes in work organisation in this period, and productivity growth,
after falling off before the First World War, rose in the interwar years.
However, the rate of change varied considerably between and within
sectors. Overall, the gradual and patchy nature of change must be stressed.
This is not surprising given the exceptional fluctuations of demand during
these years and the reluctance of the many small and medium-sized firms
in the British economy to risk the heavy investment and overheads implied
by large-scale modernisation and reorganisation of their production
processes. Even larger firms often lacked the strategy and coordination
to push through changes in production. In addition, the labour supply
situation encouraged the maintenance of unskilled-labour and craft-
intensive methods of production rather than more physical- and human-
capital intensive methods.[101] Where British employers did try to deal
with the problems of productivity, they often resorted to an intensification
of work within the existing technology and relied on other employment
policies to control and motivate labour. In this market and organisational
context most British firms continued to pursue labour policies based on
strategies of externalisation, and it is to these that we turn in the next
chapter.

### The evolving employment relationship

In Chapter 2 it was argued that in terms of the employment relationship
nineteenth-century employers pursued strategies of externalisation and
did not develop strong internal labour systems. The predominant pattern
of employment in British industry was one of loose association of
employers with their labour force and of employees with the firms for
which they worked.[1] Firms relied on the external labour market for hiring
and firing, they took labour on and laid it off as market conditions
dictated, and most paid minimal attention to the training of employees.
Wages were largely fixed according to external market signals and non-
wage benefits were rudimentary. At the same time, however, a small
number of firms pursued different strategies and developed something
more like internal labour markets, with more complex and elaborate
employment systems. During the first half of the twentieth century, this
basic pattern did not change greatly. With the exception of wartime,
labour market circumstances did not encourage major change and weak
organisational structures and managerial hierarchies were a constraint
on the development of more elaborate employment systems. However,
there were some important developments during this period and this
chapter investigates a number of diverse aspects of employment - the
tenure of jobs, patterns of recruitment and training, the payment of
wages, and the increasing importance of non-wage benefits.

**The market context**
The interwar years were characterised by large-scale unemployment
sandwiched between periods of wartime full employment. The extremely
tight labour market which developed during both wars produced some
similar consequences. Firms found it difficult to attract and retain labour;
workers were quick to realise that they could more easily find alternative
employment; and government direction of labour into munitions work
increased mobility. In order to reduce excessive labour turnover, both
governments and employers introduced a range of measures seeking to


-----

62 Continuities and changes

regulate the market. In the First World War the government initiated a
system of leaving certificates which workers in war industries had to
obtain before they could leave their jobs.[2] In the Second World War,
under the Essential Work Order, workers could neither leave their jobs
nor be dismissed without official permission. In return for this loss of
job freedom, workers were guaranteed job security and a weekly wage
even when work was not available.[3] In both wars government prompting
also encouraged the appointment of welfare and personnel officers,
improved medical, health, and safety provision, and the establishment
of canteens and other amenities.[4] Thus, during the wars many workers
obtained greater security and formality of employment; employers, in
turn, saw a reduction in their ability to employ labour on a casual
hire-and-fire basis and had to provide better conditions and facilities.
Wartime union strength and pressure gave this tendency added momen-
tum.[5] At the end of the First World War, government regulations were
rapidly dismantled, and many firms cut back the amenities and welfare
provision introduced during the special circumstances of wartime.
However, various aspects continued such as canteen and recreational
facilities and in this way there was a lasting impact.[6] The effects of the
Second World War were more lasting. At its end, though security of
employment and the guaranteed wage were discontinued, employer
initiatives proved more durable, not least because of the full employment
which followed in the 1940s and 1950s.
It is necessary to stress the effect during the interwar years of high
and fluctuating levels of unemployment.[7] From 1921 until 1940 there
were never less than one million insured workers unemployed, equivalent
to around 10 per cent of the insured labour force. The bulk of unemploy-
ment was structural and concentrated in the older staple industries and
in the north and west of the country. At certain times, especially 1921-22
and 1929-33, there were superimposed on top of this high levels of cyclical
unemployment. In these circumstances, it was unlikely that most firms
would change their employment policies from the pattern of externalisa-
tion described in Chapter 2, since it was easy for them to take on and
lay off labour at will. Hence traditional employment patterns continued.
Casual work persisted - among day workers in the docks, building work-
ers, and casuals who took up marginal employment when it became
available. In shipbuilding, employers met the adverse economic situation
after 1920 by laying off labour for long periods of time and, when trade
picked up, continued to call in workers in squads for a particular stage
of construction, only to lay them off again when that stage was completed.[8]

In coal and cotton, those who had jobs were subject to short-time working,
with reduced hours per day or days per week. In iron and steel and other


-----

The evolving employment relationship 63

industries, where it was uneconomic to work fewer hours or to shut down
for short periods, lay-offs were for longer periods of weeks and months.[9]

Even in formerly secure employment, such as the railways and gas,
structural change and increased competition led to temporary layoffs
and redundancy.[10]

Though the older staple industries were the worst affected by unem-
ployment, both short-time and periodic lay-offs also took place in the
newer industries. Thus in the motor-car industry there were short-time
working and lay-offs, once sufficient cars had been produced for the peak
sales season in the spring and summer.[11] In this way there were months
of full employment, with overtime and high wages. But, once order books
were filled, and given the reluctance of firms to carry high stocks, men
were laid off.[12] In such circumstances, some skilled men would be kept
on, but less skilled men and women were 'given their cards' and told to
wait until they were 'called for'. In the electrical industry, the production
of radios and other household appliances was also subject to seasonal
demand with short-time and lay-offs in slack periods. In industries
employing large numbers of female workers, such as electrical goods,
motor components, and food processing, extensive use was made of
part-time and temporary work, short-time and seasonal lay-offs, followed
by compulsory overtime in busy periods.[13]

In this way the general economic circumstances of abundant labour
and scarce jobs encouraged the maintenance of traditional employment
practices. There was little incentive to change the predominant pattern
of externalisation of the employment relationship or to develop stronger
internal labour market-type arrangements. However, certain important
changes did occur, and these are considered below.

**Job tenure and training**

It has been suggested in Chapter 2 that even before the First World War
there was some reduction in casualism and a slow increase in the propor-
tion of workers more or less permanently attached to an employer.[14]

Internal subcontracting and indirect employment had all but disappeared
from most areas of British industry apart from building. In other situ-
ations, as in the 'butty' system in some coalfields, or in shipbuilding
where platers employed their own helpers, or in cotton where spinners
employed their own piecers, the subcontractor was more akin to a foreman
or principal worker.[15] Most labour had come to be directly employed
and paid by the firm.
In other ways also during the interwar period the labour market became
less fluid and workers in jobs became more permanently attached to


-----

64 Continuities and changes

firms. Despite the absence of official statistics, one can draw some
conclusions about labour turnover (the ratio of employees who volun-
tarily left a firm in a given year to the average number of employees
during that same period) and labour retention (the ratio of employees
who remained with the firm over the year to the number employed at
the beginning of the year). It would seem that pre-First World War labour
mobility was high. We know, for example, that geographical mobility
was high in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and, though
not all geographical mobility involved labour turnover, there was much
overlap.[16] In the case of some skilled workers up to the late nineteenth
century, there was a tradition of 'tramping' in search of employment and
this was supported by their trade unions and not disapproved of by
employers. For their part unskilled workers were even less likely to
develop attachment or be given permanence. It is well known that they
suffered from higher unemployment and later studies show clearly that
turnover tends to be higher among the unskilled.[17] As has already been
stressed in Chapter 2, employers considered it natural to adjust to cyclical
and seasonal fluctuations in demand by discharging workers.
During the First World War, turnover at first increased because of the
greater availability of jobs, the influx of new labour into factories, and
the tendency for newcomers to turn over more rapidly than longer-term
employees. The concern with turnover (at the time called 'labour wastage'
or iabour maintenance') was reflected in a number of contemporary
studies stressing the costs involved in turnover. Attention was drawn to
the costs of recruiting and training labour, the higher costs of supervising
a rapidly changing labour force, the lower productivity of new staff, and
the lost output of experienced leavers.[18] For its part the Government
during the war sought to increase labour stability and prevent the bidding
up of wages by implementing the system of leaving certificates. Employers
reacted by introducing the various welfare measures referred to above.
Together these measures seem to have had some effect and, after rising
in the initial stages of the war, turnover later fell. It rose again with the
end of the war, only to fall dramatically from 1920 onwards and to fall
again between 1929 and 1933. It was only from the mid-1930s onwards
that it began to rise again. Concern about turnover re-emerged and
continued through the Second World War, leading to government and
employer counter-measures described above.[19]

This pattern of turnover and retention would support the view that
unemployment was the key factor: in times of high unemployment
workers were reluctant to quit their jobs and, as employed workers stayed
longer, the employment relationship became more stable. However, other
factors were also at work. Compared to the pre-war period geographical


-----

The evolving employment relationship 65

mobility was probably less in the interwar years - partly owing to growing
rigidities in the housing market, partly to the distance in location between
declining and expanding industries, and partly because of improved
unemployment benefit.[20] In addition, the flow of labour as a result of
immigration and emigration was lower in the interwar years than it had
been before the First World War.[21] These macro factors were also medi-
ated through the changing employment practices of firms - or at least of
some firms.
Thus, there were some changes, albeit uneven, in methods of recruit-
ment and discharge. In the years before the First World War a few firms
had started to hire labour in a more systematic way through an employ-
ment office.[22] During the war more firms established such offices staffed
by so-called welfare or employment managers. Their function was to
recruit workers where previously engagement had been left to foremen
or line managers.[23] During and after the war, an increased emphasis was
placed, by some firms, on more systematic selection. As one employment
manager wrote in reference to the traditional ad hoc system of hiring by
the foreman at the factory gates: 'the engagement of personnel is now
increasingly a specialised function and not incidental to supervision'.[24]

Another commentator noted, 'the selection of the most suitable
individuals is of the utmost importance in order to avoid loss of time,
trouble and money in training unsuitable material'.[25] Most of the books
and manuals published at the time stressed the need for two stages of
selection: firstly, some kind of job analysis to determine the characteristics
of the job; secondly, an interview, possibly involving basic tests, to
determine the suitability of the applicant.[26] There was also greater dis-
cussion and more formal use of internal transfers as a way of matching
workers to jobs.[27] In turn, lay-offs came more and more to be handled
by the employment office or by managers rather than the foreman.
Disciplinary dismissals increasingly had to be sanctioned by higher
management, thus removing the foreman's right to sack workers on his
own initiative.[28] However, at this point an important qualification must
be added. More formal systems of hiring and firing spread only slowly;
most firms used no criteria beyond the obvious ones such as past
experience and availability for work; most workers were still engaged
only after a perfunctory interview, leaving the 'weeding out' of unsuitable
workers to a process of trial and error on the job; and lay-offs and
dismissals were still often arbitrary.[29]

There was some shift of emphasis in the area of training. In Chapter
2 it was pointed out that, other than just picking up a trade, apprenticeship
was the main formal method of training in Britain. It was also argued
that the traditional apprenticeship was a form of delegation with strong


-----

66 Continuities and changes

external elements - the apprentice was handed over to the foreman or
skilled man and training was supposed to be in all-round and therefore
transferable skills. During the First World War and the depression years,
the apprenticeship system was disrupted and the ratio of apprentices to
journeymen declined.[30] The growth of new semi-skilled work, not learned
through apprenticeship, also reduced the importance of this traditional
method of training and both wars gave an impetus to factory-based
training programmes.[31] During the interwar years there was a growing
feeling that special programmes were the most efficient and cost-effective
method of training within the firm.[32] A number of companies instituted
such arrangements: these were usually leading firms within their sectors,
such as Armstrong Whitworth, G. & J. Weir, Mather & Platt,
Metropolitan-Vickers, British Westinghouse, Richard Thomas & Bald-
win, Stewart & Lloyds, Cadburys, ICI, Lever Bros., Dunlop.[33] In addi-
tion, night school training in technical colleges began to be more widely
used, as did, particularly from the 1930s onwards, day release schemes.
This implied an increased emphasis on training to standards and on
formal credentials, especially City and Guilds and Ordinary and Higher
National Certificates.[34] Despite this, however, for most manual workers
who received training, this consisted almost entirely of practical work
on the shopfloor which was less costly to the employer and which
produced an immediate pay-off in terms of cheap but productive labour.[35]

In practice, there were still relatively few special training departments
or training officers within British firms. Out of 1,573 engineering firms
surveyed in an official enquiry in 1925, only 26 had separate 'apprentice
masters' whose duty was to organise the training of apprentices, and the
existence of such company officers did not necessarily imply that the
training was done in a special training department.[36] For the most part,
the evidence suggests that throughout the interwar years the majority of
employers did nothing to develop the apprenticeship system and a
growing number valued it more as a source of cheap labour than as a
way of providing the skilled human resources of the future.[37] This was
perhaps not surprising given fluctuations in demand, low profits, and
abundant labour supply. In the longer term, however, it was short-sighted
and marked a significant failure in the development of human resource
capability in Britain.

**The maintenance of employment and redundancy payments**

There were other developments in this period which entailed a greater
acceptance of responsibility on the part of employers for maintaining and
stabilising the labour force. Short-time working, for example, had been


-----

The evolving employment relationship 67

used before the First World War to meet fluctuations in labour demand,
especially in the cotton and coal industries.[38] In the interwar period
short-time working increased, especially in the early and mid-1920s and
again in the early 1930s, and spread beyond traditional areas. There are
two ways of viewing short-time. On the one hand, it can be seen as a
continuation of casualism, based on a commodity view of labour with
hours fluctuating according to the demand for the product.[39] On the
other hand, it was better for the worker to have working hours reduced
or to be temporarily laid-off rather than to be permanently discharged.
A reduction in normal working hours implied the maintenance of the
employment relationship and secured some income. Temporary lay-off
was based on an implicit and sometimes explicit commitment to re-
employ when times got better. A distinctive feature of short-time working
during the interwar period was indeed that it was more organised and
systematic, a feature encouraged by the operation of the state unemploy-
ment benefit system which during the interwar years allowed employees
to draw benefit when working alternate days.[40] Though state subvention
supported and reinforced short-time working, it does not detract from
the fact that employers had an interest in retaining their employees,
especially their skilled workers, and organised such schemes themselves.[41]

Another development in the interwar years was the provision by a few
large firms of supplementary unemployment pay in addition to the flat
rate national unemployment benefit. For example, the large gas com-
panies, including the South Metropolitan and the Gas Light & Coke,
established special funds from which additional benefits could be paid
to workers who were laid off.[42] At various times, other employers, in
industries as diverse as flour milling and banking and insurance, contem-
plated contracting out of the state system and establishing their own
schemes.[43] Outside the provisions of the legislation, a number of large
firms established their own schemes to supplement the state system. The
number was not large, but included Lever Bros., Boots, ICI, Rowntrees,
Cadburys, Frys, and a handful of others operating in relatively stable
markets and requiring labour with firm-specific skills.[44] Rowntrees, for
example, introduced its scheme in 1921 as part of a set of measures to
stabilise employment. When the firm had to lay off workers, it paid an
additional benefit on top of the state benefit. This was intended to bring
single workers up to 50 per cent of their normal weekly earnings and
married men up to 60 per cent, plus an extra allowance of 5 per cent for
each dependent child, subject to a maximum of 75 per cent of normal
earnings. The fund paid benefit for one week for each two months of
employment for the first two and a half years of employment and one
week for each subsequent three months. The scheme, which was funded

entirely by the firm, covered 90 per cent of the firm's employees at its
York and other factories. Boots introduced a similar scheme in 1921
which paid a benefit equivalent to the difference between the unemployed
worker's income from all other sources and 75 per cent of his normal
average wage. Boots also tried to stabilise employment by manpower
planning, more systematic selection, and transfer of workers.[45] Though
it might be argued these schemes made it easier to lay off workers, they
did provide some commitment to the continuation of the employment
relationship and were an incentive to the firm to stabilise its employment.
They were also an incentive to employees to secure regular full-time jobs
and to maintain continuity of employment since, in most cases, there
was usually a qualifying period in terms of length of service and the
level and period of benefit was based on length of employment.[46]

The late 1920s and early 1930s also saw the beginnings of compensation
or redundancy payments for those who were laid off permanently. Pro-
vision for such payments was made by a number of large gas and
electricity companies, by some food companies, especially in the flour-
milling and confectionery industries, and by ICI and Lever Bros.[47] For
example, during the late 1920s and early 1930s, the flour-milling firms,
under the leadership of Ranks and Spillers, operated a scheme under
which those workers made redundant as a result of rationalisation were
paid from an employers' fund in the form of annuities, periodic benefits,
or lump-sum payments. Though there may have been a humanitarian
element in this scheme, the big firms in the industry undoubtedly saw
such payments as a way of getting worker and union cooperation over
rationalisation and closure.[48] Another firm which established a redun-
dancy compensation scheme in the late 1920s was the large stationery
and paper-products manufacturing firm of John Dickinson & Co.[49] In
the early 1930s the London, Midland & Scottish Railway Co. closed its
steel works at Crewe which at that time employed 600 workers. Since
the closure was not a direct result of amalgamation, the workers were
not eligible for statutory compensation under the 1921 Railway Act. The
firm, after absorbing some of the workers by transfer within the company,
paid the remainder each a lump sum based on length of service.[50]

The companies which devised such schemes were uncertain as to the
precise principle underlying their arrangements - whether they provided
a relief for hardship, compensation for lost job rights, or a means of
securing cooperation with rationalisation. They were also unclear about
the best form of provision - special pensions and annuities for older
workers, periodic benefits, or lump-sum payments.[51] Though limited in
number and in the amount paid, these compensation schemes were a
beginning and a nascent recognition of job property rights. As one

American commentator said of the schemes, they 'encouraged budgeting
labour requirements, hiring more scientifically, improving dismissal pro-
cedures, training workers more widely to enable transfers, letting normal
labour turnover deplete the working force to actual needs, introducing
labour displacing machinery more gradually and intelligently'.[52] A British
commentator noted, The schemes also have the advantage that they offer
some inducement to the firms as far as practicable to stabilise their
employment by reducing the amount of short-time and the number of
dismissals.'[53] Of course, it must be stressed that the schemes were excep-
tional. The Mond-Turner conference had recommended in 1929 that 'all
firms... should set up a reserve fund, to be set aside from profits, for
the purpose of assisting displaced workers'.[54] The TUC had subsequently
asked the main employers' organisation, the National Confederation of
Employers' Organisations (NCEO), to discuss this in the context of other
methods of stabilising employment. However the NCEO, representing
the majority of employers, rejected the idea and indeed favoured the
reduction of state unemployment provision.[55]

**Wage systems**

On wage matters, British employers thought in terms of money rather
than efficiency wages. In other words, they thought in terms of the money
level of wages and the external relationship which wages bore to those
paid by other employers rather than in terms of the relationship between
wages and output within the firm. Before the First World War there were
some who had argued for a high-wage, high-output approach to labour
management.[56] But this was not a view which commended itself to most
British employers. In the interwar years there continued to be those who
put this case. In their book The Secret of High Wages, B. Austin and
W.F. Lloyd drew the contrast between the American employers' better
understanding of the concept of high-efficiency wages and British
employers who sought to minimise money wages and relied on piecework
as the main incentive device to higher output.[57] Piecework, they noted,
led to uncertainty for employers and employees alike and to restriction
of output by workers, especially where management resorted to cutting
rates when earnings got too high. In the interwar years the coal owners
were the most important and prominent, though certainly not the only,
case of a group of employers who looked to lower wages and longer
hours as a solution to their economic problems.[58]

The system of district and national collective bargaining which had
developed in many industries by the First World War may have
encouraged this approach to wages in that through such arrangements

employers hoped to set wages as low as possible. There were very few
firms which explicitly pursued a high-wage, high-output policy. For a
time one was the Ford Motor Company. It followed the practice of its
American parent, did not join its industry employers' association, and
eschewed the use of piecework. It paid a high wage but expected in
return high productivity and tight discipline. In this it was considered a
dangerous deviant, and the Engineering Employers' Federation (EEF)
tried hard to dissuade other engineering firms from following its example.
In the 1930s depression Ford abandoned its high-wage policy, though
not its adherence to time rates.[59]

The criteria used in wage fixing continued to have a large external
element. Comparability and relativities between groups of workers were
the most important factors underlying the wage structure. For adjusting
wages, the 'state of trade' remained the most important criterion. In some
industries, notably iron and steel, this continued to be done automatically
for some grades by the use of sliding scales based on the selling price
of the product. In coal mining from 1921 an elaborate scheme existed
for making adjustments on the basis of the proceeds or profits of each
mining district.[60] Such schemes had real shortcomings. They concentrated
on only one factor and, where they were industry-wide, they could not
take account of firm-level differences in productivity and profitability.
One development during the First World War was the emergence of the
cost of living as an explicit criterion in wage fixing. During the war, in
the absence of a free market within which the value of the product could
be set and hence the value of labour determined, the government
encouraged the use of the cost of living index for adjusting wages. By
the end of 1922, about three million workers were covered by automatic
sliding-scale arrangements. When, from the recession onwards, the cost
of living fell and wages were automatically reduced, these arrangements
began to fall out of favour with trade unions, and the number covered
declined to about one and a half million by 1939. During the Second
World War, however, the number covered again increased to about two
and a half million.[61]

Thus, in terms of wage fixing, great emphasis was placed on external
criteria such as the state of trade and the cost of living. Less emphasis
was placed on internal criteria such as productivity and profitability.
One, though minority, exception to this was the tradition of profit-sharing
in British industry. This took various forms: in a few cases ordinary
shares were distributed; more usually cash bonuses were paid on top of
the normal wages. There were three periods when profit-sharing obtained
some popularity: in the late 1880s and early 1890s, just before the First
World War, and in the years after the First World War.[62] A few leading

firms were involved - including the South Metropolitan Gas Company
which established a scheme in 1889, Lever Bros, in 1909, Boots in 1912,
and ICI in 1928. Over time, the emphasis of such schemes shifted. Some
of the earlier schemes were primarily and openly anti-trade union, while
later schemes were more orientated towards encouraging performance.
Profit-sharing was seen increasingly as a direct incentive and also as a
way of reducing labour turnover and increasing worker commitment.[63]

However, it always remained an exceptional practice: before the First
World War there were 125 firms with profit-sharing schemes; by the
outbreak of the Second World War there were still only 266 schemes
covering about 223,000 workers.[64]

There were various reasons why profit-sharing did not become more
prominent in British industry. Some have suggested that trade union
opposition was a significant factor, and it is true that unions were strongly
opposed to some of the earlier schemes which were openly anti-union.
They were also suspicious of any scheme which aimed at increasing
worker loyalty to the firm at the expense of trade unionism. Unions
preferred a standard wage rate throughout a craft or industry, whereas
under profit-sharing workers' incomes varied between firms and, within
firms, varied between workers. Moreover, unions found it difficult to
reconcile individually based profit-sharing with collective bargaining.[65]

However, the evidence suggests that the opposition from rank-and-file
members was never very strong and unions could not block the introduc-
tion of profit-sharing schemes where management wished it. The main
reason for their rarity was that most British employers, especially in the
staple industries, were not interested. They preferred to rely on national
collective bargaining, plus piecework within the firm.[66]

Indeed the growth of payment by results or piecework was a much
more important development in the first half of the twentieth century.
Some industries, notably textiles, had long made extensive use of
piecework, while others, such as building and printing, remained pre-
dominantly time work. But in a significant number of industries, such
as engineering, iron and steel, and food and drink, there was a substantial
shift towards piecework systems. In 1886, in engineering, for example,
only 6 per cent of turners and 11 per cent of machinemen were on
piecework. After the lock-out of 1897-8, the employers asserted their
right, over trade union opposition, to introduce piecework, and the
number of such schemes gradually increased. By 1906, 24 per cent of
fitters, 32 per cent of turners, and 42 per cent of machinemen were paid
by results of some kind.[67] The First World War saw a further increase
in piecework, stimulated by the introduction of automatic machines
operated by less skilled labour, longer production runs, and the need to


-----

72 Continuities and changes

boost war output. By early 1917, at least one-third of engineering firms
were working on a piecework basis.[68] By 1926 the proportion of fitters
on piecework was 51 per cent and by 1938 this had risen to 62 per cent,
with as many as 81 per cent of turners and machinemen paid by results
of some kind.[69] The increase in payment-by-results continued during the
Second World War, stimulated by similar factors as during the First
War.[70] Engineering saw the most dramatic changes once again, but other
sectors were also affected. Thus, taking all industries, the number of
wage earners covered by payment-by-results rose from 25 per cent in
1938 to 32 per cent by 1951.[71]

To understand the implications of the spread of piecework, it is
necessary to distinguish the different types of payment-by-results systems.
The oldest and simplest was straight piecework. Under such a system,
the worker was paid a fixed money price for each unit of output. Wages
then varied simply according to the units of output produced and the
relationship between wage and output was linear. This form of piecework
constituted a simple market transaction between the employer and the
pieceworker. There were no safeguards for the worker and the basis of
the system was 'no work, no pay'. Where work was interrupted because
of shortages of materials or parts, the worker bore the risk. On the other
hand, when demand was high and the flow of materials uninterrupted,
the worker could, theoretically at least, push earnings up to the physical
limit. From the workers' point of view, such a system had a major
disadvantage because of its insecurity and fluctuations. Of course, this
might also work to the employers' disadvantage and lead to resentment
and labour turnover. But, from the employers' point of view, there were
more serious disadvantages. Unit labour costs tended to remain constant
at all levels of output, and the employer could not benefit from any
increased worker productivity, without cutting rates, which in turn made
workers restrict output.
The payment-by-results systems which firms increasingly used from
the early twentieth century onwards tried to overcome these various
problems. For example, it became more common to include a minimum
fall-back time rate in payment-by-results systems which provided some
basic income guarantee to the worker.[72] In engineering the EEF and the
Amalgamated Society of Engineers (ASE) agreed the principle of guaran-
teeing minimum time rates.[73] The practice of paying 'waiting time' also
spread in certain industries, so that when a worker was unable to work
for reasons beyond his control, he was paid something, either a basic
time rate or a proportion of average piecework earnings.[74] Not all firms
made these provisions and in some industries such as clothing, and in
outworking employment, pure piecework continued.[75]

The evolving employment relationship 73

Most of the payment-by-results systems which spread from the begin-
ning of the twentieth century were of the so-called premium bonus type.
Under these systems, the worker was guaranteed a basic rate. On all
output above the basic level expected for the guaranteed rate, the worker
earned a bonus or premium per piece. Increasingly in the interwar years,
as methods of work measurement spread, the bonus was calculated not
in terms of physical output per se, but in terms of time or time saved.
Usually a so-called standard time was set for a job and a bonus was paid
in relation to the time saved in carrying out the job or for the extra
output in the time allowed. The bonus could be set in various ways, and
in the interwar years there was a growing literature on the subject. It
was possible, for example, to fix the bonus in such a way that it was very
similar to straight proportional piecework, with earnings rising in the
same proportion as output. This, however, did not have strong incentive
advantages from the employer's point of view. Alternatively it was poss-
ible to fix the bonus so that as output increased, the money price paid
for each unit effectively increased. Such so-called 'progressive' systems
were intended to encourage above average performance and were thought
to be particularly useful when direct labour costs were only a small
proportion of total costs. In such circumstances it was considered an
advantage for the firm to pay more for labour if the total output could
be increased and overhead costs spread over a larger output.[76] Sig-
nificantly such schemes were less common in Britain than in the US
where labour costs were high, but small in relation to capital. In Britain
the opposite was true and most systems were of the so-called 'regressive'
type, in the sense that the more units a worker turned out, the more
money he would be paid in aggregate, but the less he got per unit. In
this way labour costs automatically declined as output increased.[77]

In various ways during this period piecework systems became more
formalised and more subject to safeguards for workers. In engineering,
for example, around the First World War a number of rules grew up
governing piecework. In the first place, as has already been noted, basic
time rates came to be guaranteed. Secondly, the idea also became estab-
lished of a 'minimum piecework standard', or the amount which a
pieceworker should be able to earn.[78] Thirdly, as a safeguard against
rate-cutting, it was agreed in 1919 that piecework prices and bonus times
could not be altered unless the materials, means, or methods of produc-
tion were changed. Finally, it was agreed that piecework prices and bonus
times should be fixed by mutual agreement, with disagreements being
subject to review under the industry's disputes procedure. The engineer-
ing employers were prepared to make these concessions because they
saw piecework as a crucial part of their strategy. In the longer term,


-----

however, in the post-Second World War period, the spread of piecework
was to create problems for employers.
In contrast with the growth of piecework and inventiveness in terms
of new bonus systems, much less attention was paid to time-based systems
of payment. In fact, the majority of workers in Britain still continued to
be paid by time, although most of the systems were of a rudimentary
nature. In traditional areas, such as the building and woodworking trades,
the time rate was usually fixed on the basis of customary differentials
and was adjusted in line with the state of trade and changes in the cost
of living. In only a few industries, as on the railways, in banking and
insurance, and in the public sector, were there more complex systems of
job grades, classifications, and hierarchies.[79] It was only in the late 1930s
that there were new developments in terms of time-based systems, with
the beginnings of job analysis and job-grading, the forerunner of modern
job evaluation and merit rating. These involved the use of explicit criteria,
such as length of training, dexterity and skill, and level of responsibility,
to compare jobs within a firm in order to work out internal wage structures.
Before the Second World War interest in job evaluation was confined to
a few firms such as ICI, Unilever, Courtaulds, Pilkingtons, and Cad-
burys.[80]

**Non-wage benefits**

For most manual workers, non-wage benefits remained rudimentary or
non-existent. In those cases where provision was made by the employer
for sickness and old age, this was usually informal and ex gratia and
directed at certain types of employees, especially supervisory and clerical
staff. Most manual workers continued to have minimal non-wage benefits,
reflecting the loose and short-term nature of the attachment between the
employer and his employees. However, there was change during this
period and an extension of more formally constituted benefit schemes.
In the area of pensions, before the First World War, there were various
types of provision. Some workers, usually skilled men, provided for
themselves through trade unions, friendly societies, and insurance com-
panies. The years 1908-9 saw the beginnings of the state system, though
until 1926 this was very limited, means-tested, and confined to those over
70 years of age. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries,
employer provision at first took the form of company-sponsored savings
clubs, provident funds, and friendly societies, intended to help with
unemployment and sickness, but which were also used in an ad hoc way
to provide pensions for old age. However, as we saw in Chapter 2, a
number of large employers had started to promote more formally con-

stituted schemes, though at first these were restricted to white-collar
employees. Prominent among such employers were the railway com-
panies, the gas companies, and such large firms as J. & P. Coats, Fine
Cotton Spinners & Doublers, J. & J. Colmans, W. D. & H. O. Wills, and
Siemens and, in white-collar employment, the banks and insurance
companies. By the mid-1920s an increasing number of large firms were
providing pensions as a contractual employment right to their employees,
both white and blue collar, and the number of formally constituted and
funded schemes continued to grow through the 1930s, when the large
insurance companies first offered pension packages to industrial firms.
By the late 1930s about a tenth of British workers were in employer-based
pension schemes and manual workers constituted a significant proportion
of those covered.[81] Historians who have examined the origins of company
pension schemes in Britain have stressed that employers were the main
initiating force.[82] It was employer policies which encouraged the growth
of firm-based schemes and which determined their shape - this rather
than any prompting from the state or from workers or their unions. In
some cases benevolence and traditional paternalism may have been
significant employer motives. But most employers realised that there
could be real benefits from providing pension schemes. They saw them
as a way of attracting and retaining labour of the right sort and as a
means of increasing worker loyalty and attachment to the firm. The actual
rules of the pension schemes which emerged in the first half of the
twentieth century lend support to this interpretation: there was usually
a qualifying period; benefits were related to length of service; and early
leavers lost all or most of their entitlement. The concentration of the
early pension schemes in large firms suggests that they were an attempt
to develop a more extensive, bureaucratically based employment relation-
ship internal to the firm.[83]

There was also an extension of sick-pay schemes. In the late nineteenth
century a minority of employers made ex gratia payments to workers off
sick or requiring medical attention.[84] Such payments were regarded as
benevolences to be given or withheld by the employer without question
from the recipient. From the 1880s onwards a growing number of firms
started to sponsor works' sick clubs, benevolent funds, and savings
schemes into which workers contributed and from which they received
benefits. Where firms insisted on membership as a condition of employ-
ment, the club had to be registered as a friendly society. The clubs were
subsidised by the employers either by means of an annual fixed sum or
on a per capita basis or by paying a proportion of the benefits.[85] During
the interwar years there was a slow growth of employer-based schemes.
In some cases this involved greater employer support for contributory


-----

76 Continuities and changes

sick clubs which continued to exist throughout the period. In other cases,
especially in larger firms and for supervisory and white-collar workers,
employers established schemes financed from their own funds. In the
case of white-collar staff these usually entitled those off sick to full wages
for a period during their absence.[86] The rules of sick schemes bore certain
similarities to those of pension arrangements in that there was usually a
minimum period of service required in order to qualify and the length
of payment was tied to the duration of service with the firm. By the late
1940s, about a half of the claimants for state national-insurance benefit
were also covered by employers' sick-pay schemes, though this varied
greatly between classes of workers - the proportion ranging from about
one third among manual workers to 90 per cent for white-collar staff.[87]

As with pensions, the main initiative behind sick-pay schemes seems to
have come not from trade union or state prompting,[88] but from employers,
and mainly from a few large firms, whose intention was to retain labour
and elicit cooperation.[89]

One significant development in terms of fringe benefits at the end of
the interwar period was an increase in holidays with pay for manual
workers. Paid holidays may be seen as a fringe benefit in the sense that
they are an addition to the simple cash relationship and are an indication
of a more permanent employment relationship based on continuous
service. After the First World War the provision of paid holidays spread
gradually, but then increased substantially from the mid-1930s onwards.
In part this was due to a desire of employers to forestall statutory
imposition and in part it was prompted by the 1938 Holidays With Pay
Act. Thus the number of manual workers entitled to paid holidays grew
from about one and a half million in 1936 to four million by 1939, out
of a total workforce of about 18.5 million manual and clerical workers.[90]

There was at first some resistance from the employers' associations,
especially in coal, cotton, and parts of engineering, but the bigger firms,
especially in the newer sectors, went ahead and introduced paid holi-
days.[91] An analysis of the provision of schemes and rules again shows
a certain pattern: most required a qualifying length of service; they were
restricted to regular employees and excluded part-time and temporary
workers; under many schemes the number of days entitlement and the
level of pay were tied to length of service; and leavers did not usually
get their holiday days as pay.[92]

Thus, in the interwar years there was an extension of fringe benefits
over and above the cash nexus and, increasingly, formally constituted
benefits came to replace more informal arrangements. This was a sign
of an increasing internalisation of the employment relationship,
especially in larger firms. However, fringe benefits were still limited both


-----

The evolving employment relationship 77

in extent and in the numbers covered. Moreover, given industry-level
collective bargaining, weak firm-level trade unionism, and employers'
insistence on managerial prerogatives, these fringe benefits were not
usually subject to formal collective bargaining. An important final point
must be made. The provision of such fringe benefits, together with others
such as canteens and washing facilities, was usually different for different
groups of workers - managerial, supervisory, white collar, and manual.
In part this reflected the deep-rooted class distinctions in British society,
especially between the 'works' or 'hourly' or 'weekly' employees on the
one hand and 'staff' or 'salaried' employees on the other, with the latter
not only enjoying better pay and shorter hours, but also more secure
jobs, better sick pay, and superior pensions. Such status distinctions in
part also reflected conscious employer policies, designed to reinforce
divisions at work as well as to secure the loyalty of more strategically
placed employees.[93] Whatever the reasons for them, they were to remain
deeply entrenched in firms' employment policies.

**Conclusions**

The period from the early twentieth century through to the Second World
War saw a continuation by most British employers of what might be
termed externalisation of the employment relationship. Firms relied on
the external market for hiring and firing, they took labour on and laid
it off as required, paid minimal attention to the training and development
of employees, and fixed wages largely according to external market
signals. These policies were shaped by inherited attitudes as well as by
economic and organisational circumstances. Most employers preferred
to provide minimal wages and benefits and to hire and fire in a traditional
manner, marginally adjusting to shifts in demand. They saw labour as a
commodity to be purchased at the going rate in the market place, but
with only minimal rights and benefits within the workplace. These atti-
tudes accorded well with market structures and company organisation
in the interwar years: they suited product markets subject to uncertainty
and fluctuations; they corresponded with labour markets where there
was an abundant supply of labour; and they suited both small and
medium-sized firms as well as large, but loosely coordinated, enterprises.
In these circumstances a pattern of externalisation and market-based
relations prevailed.
The period, however, also saw some significant changes. It saw a
further decline of traditional paternalism, based on ex gratia informal
provision by the employer and on close links between firm, family, and
locality. The reasons for this decline included the growth, during two


-----

78 Continuities and changes

world wars, of trade unionism and collective bargaining and the develop-
ment of state welfare provision. As important, however, was the growth
of larger, multi-plant and managerially controlled enterprises, signifying
a decline of local ownership by an identifiable group of individuals or
families and the passing of close personal and local links. Of course,
elements of an older-style paternalism continued and were to be found
in both large and small firms. Such paternalism could even be created
anew, as, for example, in the case of some of the colliery villages in the
new Nottinghamshire coalfield.[94] On the whole, however, it became
increasingly difficult to maintain. More significant for the future was the
slow development of a more complex and extensive employment relation-
ship. This was the result of a gradual set of changes which reinforced
each other over time, including macro-economic changes, the spread of
collectively negotiated agreements, and the development within firms of
more modern personnel policies. The changes involved a closer attach-
ment of workers to firms, more elaborate internal labour market systems,
and more extensive wage and benefit provisions. This more stable and
complex employment relationship was to be found most clearly in a
number of large firms, especially in the newer sectors of industry, where
market and technological factors both permitted and required new pat-
terns of employment.

### Employers, unions, and collective bargaining

In the late nineteenth century an embryonic system of industrial relations
had developed in Britain based primarily on employer recognition of
trade unions through employers' associations, which negotiated and
administered agreements covering procedures and wages and conditions.
The procedural arrangements for handling disputes and negotiating
agreements had become national in scope, while agreements on wages
and conditions were less well developed and primarily covered only a
district or region. This system of multi-employer bargaining was another
aspect of the externalisation of labour management by British employers.
The system suited employers in that it allowed them to maximise their
collective strength through their associations, to counter the pressure for
job control from skilled workers, and to reduce some of the uncertainty
surrounding the fixing of wages and conditions. It also economised on
the costs of investing in strong internal structures and hierarchies. It was
argued in Chapter 2 that the main initiative for these arrangements came
from the employers. However, the trade unions also obtained some real
benefits - in particular formal recognition and a growing standardisation
of pay and conditions. Union members also gained some benefits, but
they often felt constrained by the system as the events of the years before
the First World War showed. This chapter argues that in the first half of
the twentieth century employers maintained and extended this exter-
nalised system of industrial relations, though towards the end of the
period it was beginning to exhibit contradictions and weaknesses. For
the most part, British employers failed to develop domestic arrangements
internally within their firms.

**The pre-First World War period**

Had British employers wished to get rid of trade unions and collective
bargaining, the depressed conditions of the first years of the twentieth
century and the legal reversal for trade unionism in the Taff Vale decision
of 1901, gave them something of an opportunity. However, as Clegg,

Fox, and Thompson pointed out, There were relatively few instances of
organized employers taking advantage of it to attempt to weaken or
destroy the unions.'[1] In part this may be taken as evidence that British
employers saw some advantages in working with trade unions. In larger
part it indicated that employers lacked the organisation and determina-
tion at both national and firm levels to pursue a costly strategy of union
exclusion. However, some major employers, such as the shipping and
railway companies, did remain anti-union, and others used the oppor-
tunity more vigorously to diminish union influence and to impose restric-
tive, long-term wage agreements on the unions. With the return of fuller
employment from 1906 onwards, union membership rose from 2.6 million
members in 1910 to 4.1 million, or about a quarter of the working
population, in 1913, and the number of strikes rose over the same period
from 521 to 1,459 per year.[2] For some workers, such as the railwaymen
and many unskilled workers, strikes represented an attempt to gain
recognition and introduce collective bargaining. In areas where collective
bargaining already existed, the unrest of these prewar years was often a
reaction to procedural and wages agreements which had been created
over the two previous decades. Many of the strikes in building, engineer-
ing, and cotton attempted to shake off the restrictions of the new systems
and to reassert trade practices held in check since the mid-1890s. In
addition, long-term agreements on wage rates were seen by some union
members as a cause of stagnant or falling real wages. In these circum-
stances, because of the involvement of union leaders in the official
procedures, the action tended to be local and led by shop stewards, who
began to emerge as important work group leaders.[3]

A number of agreements were challenged and rejected by the unions
and their members during the years before the war. Thus, in 1913, the
cotton spinners' union gave notice to terminate the Brooklands Agree-
ment; in shipbuilding the boilermakers' society abrogated the main
national agreement; in the London building trades the employers locked
out union members who, on three separate occasions, rejected agreed
settlements; and in engineering the Amalgamated Society of Engineers
(ASE) terminated the national procedure in 1914. On the eve of the First
World War, then, there was uncertainty as to the continuity of some of
these agreements. On the other hand, there were clear signs that the
employers were determined to maintain the arrangements. The EEF, for
example, refused to negotiate on wages and conditions until the ASE
agreed to the reintroduction of the procedure. The outcome was a revision
on terms more favourable to the union.[4] A similar mixture of strength
and shrewd concessions on the part of the employers reestablished the
systems in cotton and building. Meanwhile during these years, the two

main groups of employers of manual labour who had stood out most
strongly against unions, the railway companies and the shipping
employers, finally conceded recognition. In 1911 the railway companies,
under union and government pressure, accorded recognition, albeit in
an arm's-length manner through a system of conciliation boards.[5]

Similarly, the shipowners, after more than a quarter century of fierce
hostility to trade unionism, also recognised in 1911, but in a reluctant
and indirect manner without any permanent machinery being estab-
lished.[6] Overall the total number of conciliation and collective bargaining
arrangements in Britain grew from 64 in 1894, to 162 in 1905, and 325
in 1913.[7] Thus, though fragile, the collective bargaining institutions
created in the late nineteenth century remained in place and were even
extended on the eve of the First World War.

**The war and its aftermath**

The First World War was important in terms of consolidating and
extending this system of industrial relations. The wartime history of
industrial relations has been told many times - often with an emphasis
on the more dramatic but less enduring aspects.[8] Here it is necessary to
emphasise a number of points. Trade union membership increased sub-
stantially, rising to 6.5 million in 1918 and continuing to increase to 8.3
million in 1920, by which time union membership represented about 45
per cent of the working population.[9] In the period up to 1920, for the
first time, trade unionism achieved a presence in most areas of British
industry. Simultaneously, employer organisation increased and solidified,
in part in response to rising union membership and militancy, in part in
response to the prompting of government.[10] In a report in 1917, G. R.
Askwith, the Chief Industrial Commissioner, stated,

As regards the extent to which various employers' associations cover the
ground, it may be said that all the more important industries of the country
are adequately represented by one or other of the associations and that, on
the whole, the associations include in their membership the majority of the
firms engaged in their respective trades.[11]

In 1914 there were 1,487 employers' organisations; by the early 1920s
this had risen to 2,403 and membership coverage was greatly increased.[12]

Along with enhanced organisation on both sides, there went a greater
recognition by employers of trade unions. Those employers who had
already recognised unions for skilled men now formally acknowledged
unions for semi-skilled and unskilled workers. Recognition was also
extended further in previously poorly organised industries such as


-----

chemicals and food-processing and, in addition, there was some limited
recognition of unions for white collar and supervisory staff.[13]

During the war, collective bargaining developed in two main directions.
In the first place, wartime conditions extended the scope and depth of
workplace bargaining. The industrial truce which trade union leaders
entered into with the government at the beginning of the war prevented
them leading official strike action. Yet wartime conditions increased the
need for consultation and bargaining at the workplace. Alterations in
production techniques, the introduction of new types of work, and
changes in wage rates at shopfloor level, all required frequent adjust-
ments. Also, full employment, rising inflation, and the extension of
payment-by-results systems created further pressures and opportunities
for workplace bargaining which came increasingly to be conducted by
shop stewards.[14] In engineering, shipbuilding, mining, printing, and
building, workplace representatives had existed before the war and had
already begun to play a part in informal bargaining.[15] For the most part,
however, their prewar function had been to act as intermediaries between
the union and the membership and to serve as guardians of district
standards. As such, employers gave them little recognition. However, in
the special circumstances of the war, they assumed a real bargaining
function and came more and more to negotiate on wages and workplace
conditions. As shop steward activity increased, employers reluctantly
accepted the necessity of recognising them and the value of dealing with
works committees which they sometimes formed. 'Often', said an official
report, 'the institution of a works committee is due to the initiative of
an employer or manager ... who finds that his task is greatly eased if
he can deal with an accredited representative of the workmen.'[16]

These factors can be seen clearly in the case of the engineering industry
where the most formal recognition of shop stewards was accorded.
Limited recognition was first conceded by Coventry engineering
employers after a strike in 1917 and then, later in the same year, by the
Engineering Employers nationally. At the end of the war, though shop
steward power was declining, the Engineering Employers pushed for an
agreement with all the main engineering unions on shop steward recogni-
tion. Signed in 1919, this agreement was an attempt by the employers to
bring shop stewards within the existing 'constitutional' framework of the
industry.[17] The agreement allowed workers to elect shop stewards; names
of stewards, their constituencies, and the unions to which they belonged
were to be passed by the union concerned to management; provision
was also made for joint works committees which were to serve as an
official stage in the industry disputes procedure; and stewards on works
committees were given the right to visit parts of the plant outside their


-----

constituency. By linking shop stewards and works committees with the
industry's Provisions for Avoiding Disputes, the employers intended to
take controversial questions away from the stewards and pass them over
to district and national union and association officials. In its general
provisions, the agreement stated, 'shop stewards shall be subject to the
control of the trade unions and shall act in accordance with the rules
and regulations of the trade unions and agreements with employers...
Employers and shop stewards and works committees shall not be entitled
to enter into any agreement inconsistent with agreements between the
Federation or local association and the trade unions.'[18] This clearly
represented an attempt by the employers to circumscribe and contain
the independent activity of stewards at the workplace.[19]

During the First World War collective bargaining also developed at
the industry level. In an attempt to contain the upsurge in workplace
activity, both procedural and wage systems at national level were recast,
extended, or introduced for the first time. Here government intervention
played a part, and the compulsory arbitration arrangements which the
government established for the period of the war were of particular
significance. In response to rapid increases in the cost of living, the
arbitration authorities came to treat each industry as a whole and awarded
national across-the-board increases. These narrowed differentials
between firms and areas and familiarised the two sides of industry with
the notion of national arrangements.[20] The reports of the official Whitley
Committee between 1917 and 1918 were also important in recommending
the extension of voluntary collective bargaining. The Committee chose
as its format joint industrial councils, made up of representatives of trade
unions and employers' organisations at national and district level, with
joint works committees at plant level, and with bargaining over wages
and conditions concentrated at industry and district level. In its essentials,
this format was drawn from already existing arrangements and its effect
was mainly to extend collective bargaining to previously unorganised
and partially organised industries.[21]

However, even in the absence of government intervention and prompt-
ing, it is likely that industry-wide bargaining would have developed
further. Multi-employer bargaining was, after all, the tried and tested
response of employers to union pressure and shopfloor assertiveness.
The establishment of interlocking procedural and wage systems at district
and industry level was seen by employers as a way of checking union
leapfrogging and controlling independent worker action at the level of
the workplace. Recognising the strength of the trade unions, employers
felt that there were real advantages in dealing with them collectively.
Moreover, as a Ministry of Labour report put it, 'Many employers prefer


-----

84 Continuities and change

not to deal with trade unions in the works but with the outside trade
union organisation.'[22] Thus, by 1920, in most British industries firms had
come to rely heavily for industrial relations purposes on agreements
negotiated by employers' associations. Such agreements were pre-
dominantly negotiated by the central headquarters of the employers'
federation and the trade unions concerned, as national bargaining super-
seded district and regional bargaining. Prima facie, these arrangements
constituted a well-ordered system, providing a framework of wages and
conditions and a means whereby issues not settled within the firm could
be taken outside the company and through an external procedure. By
1920 there were in Britain over 2,500 multi-employer agreements, of
growing formality and detail, covering either particular districts, regions,
or whole industries, and directly or indirectly covering more than half
the working population.[23]

**Collective bargaining through the depression years**

The advent of depression in autumn 1920, and the shift in the balance
of power, put severe strains on this system and presented employers with
an opportunity to reshape it if they so desired. Overall they did not,
though the story is mixed. The rapid deflation and rising unemployment
certainly presented an opportunity for employers to cut wages, and
reductions were massive between 1921 and 1923, with many of the
reductions being made relatively automatically through the national
machinery, especially where sliding-scale arrangements existed.[24] Trade
union membership fell by about one-third, or 2.7 million, in the two
years 1921 and 1922 and thereafter continued to decline, though less
steeply and with some temporary increases. Yet, even at its lowest interwar
point in 1933, the total membership of 4.4 million was higher than it had
been before the war.[25] In practice, actual union strength held up much
better than the membership figures would suggest, since sympathy
towards trade unionism remained on the part of many workers and state
unemployment benefit provided a floor under union activity.[26] Despite,
or perhaps because of, the dramatic disputes in the early 1920s, employers
realised that an out-and-out attack on trade unions would be extremely
costly. Instead they were prepared to continue formal recognition through
their associations, in the knowledge that other firms were in the same
position.
In the circumstances of the early 1920s, workplace bargaining was
undermined and shop steward activity considerably reduced. Many works
committees which had been established in earlier years ceased to operate,
while others were much diminished in activity and scope. Some employers


-----

Employers, unions, and collective bargaining 85

refused to deal with workplace representatives and used the opportunity
to get rid of union activists. However, the experience was uneven, and
shopfloor collective strength often persisted, especially among skilled
men in industries such as engineering where, also, national recognition
of shop stewards provided a floor of formal rights and helped maintain
steward existence.[27] At national level some of the collective bargaining
arrangements collapsed, especially in those industries where Whitley-
inspired machinery had not had time to take deep root. The number of
Whitley-style councils and committees, for example, fell from over 100
in 1920 to 47 by 1926, and many district councils ceased to function.[28]

However, it must be stressed that overall most multi-employer arrange-
ments survived and employers were willing to sustain them, as some of
the main confrontations of the post-1920 period demonstrate.
In engineering, for example, the employers were determined to use
the recession to reaffirm the industry's procedural framework and to
reassert the rights which they believed it enshrined. Since the ASE had
withdrawn in 1913 from the 1898 Terms of Settlement, there was no
formally agreed statement of managerial functions. During the war,
workers had been able to claim a greater say in decision-making and
impose restrictions on management. When the post-war boom broke and
unemployment rose, the engineering unions became more defensive and
restrictive, in particular on overtime working, the introduction of payment
by results, and machine manning. The Engineering Employers, for their
part, were determined not to see their prerogatives further undermined
and wished to reduce costs by curtailing union practices. From early
1921 the Federation took a harder line with the Amalgamated Engineering
Union (AEU - formed in 1920 by a merger of the ASE and a number
of smaller unions) and threatened to lock out its members over a number
of different issues: a union embargo on overtime, restrictions on the
working of payment by results, and refusal to allow firms to operate
certain machines except on conditions laid down by the union.[29] At
length, in late 1921 the Federation forced the AEU executive to sign a
memorandum accepting a new managerial functions clause and abandon-
ing the claim to block managerial changes in disputed situations. When
the AEU membership rejected this, in March 1922, the Engineering
Employers locked them out and later extended the lock-out to 50 other
unions in the industry.
This lock-out, lasting over three months, was the largest dispute in the
interwar years outside coal mining and ended with the unions returning
to work on the Employers' terms. The EEF made it clear that the dispute
was about their formal rights and managerial functions. They were
determined to stress one important principle, namely that there were


-----

86 Continuities and change

certain areas where management had authority and where there could
be no 'dual control or veto on management'.[30] The so-called 'status quo'
question (that is, what happened, under the procedure, when the union
objected to proposed managerial changes) had been fudged in 1914 when
the procedure alone had been confirmed. But it was an inevitable issue,
given management's claim to be able to introduce changes, the workers'
right to object under the procedure, and the delay subsequently involved
in hearing a case. The employers strongly denied the need to obtain trade
union consent before changing working practices and held that a settle-
ment of this issue was a necessary requirement for the efficient operation
of their businesses and for the integrity of the industry's collective
bargaining framework. The agreement which ended the lock-out
reaffirmed the procedural system and extended it to all unions in the
industry. It stated that 'the employers have the right to manage their
establishments and the trade unions have the right to exercise their
functions.'[31] The unions were forced to recognise the employers' right
to make changes and henceforward, while cases were going through
procedure, work was to be carried out 'under the conditions following
the act of management'. In the course of their victory the employers dealt
a severe blow to the substance of workplace bargaining and increased
the discretion of employers locally to press conditions on the unions.
Bargaining was increasingly focussed at national level or made subject
to national constraints. When, from time to time during the interwar
years, the unions showed any restiveness with these arrangements, the
EEF used a combination of promises and threats to put them off.[32] On
wages and conditions, also, the aim of the employers was to maintain
the national system of bargaining. Thus, at various times, they threatened
to lock out unions which tried to pursue claims for a particular class of
workers, such as foundrymen and toolmakers and checked the re-emer-
gence of district wage movements and pattern-setting by high-wage
areas.[33] Later, they refused to accept sectional bargaining on behalf of
separate parts of the industry such as motor cars and aircraft which from
the mid 1930s onwards enjoyed greater prosperity than the rest of the
industry.[34] Along with this, they always prohibited plant or workshop
claims while national negotiations were in progress - though, on this
issue, as will be seen, they were less successful.[35]

In coal mining, the events of the 1920s dealt a more serious blow to
the substance and practice of collective bargaining. However, again, the
system of multi-employer bargaining survived. In fact, the disputes of
these years were very much concerned with the structure of bargaining.
The coal owners were one group of employers who had never really
favoured national bargaining, preferring instead that wages and condi-

tions be negotiated at district level according to district circumstances
and with bargaining about details taking place at pit level. It was the
Miners' Federation which favoured national bargaining and the govern-
ment which during the war had helped bring it about. From the early
1920s the employers, faced with falling prices, low productivity and
profitability, and fierce competition in foreign markets, concentrated their
attention on the wage-bargaining system and on reducing wages costs.[36]

In 1921, after decontrol of the industry and a four months' lock-out, the
employers forced wage reductions on a district by district basis, thus
weakening the substance of industry bargaining, though a national board
and minimum wage remained. The return to the gold standard in 1925,
and its impact on the profitability of coal exports, further exacerbated
the situation and brought about a climax. After the bitter seven months'
lock-out of 1926, following the collapse of the General Strike in sympathy
with the miners, the coal owners insisted on the complete abolition of
the national bargaining system and demanded district agreements, incor-
porating wage reductions and increases in hours. They followed up their
victory with a vigorous reassertion of managerial prerogatives and, in
Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, and South Wales, with support for the
breakaway so-called Spencer union.[37] Yet, it needs to be stressed that
most coal owners and most district employers' associations did not
abrogate recognition nor support the Spencer union, and it is significant
that the owners who did support the breakaway union looked not to
complete non-unionism, but to this alternative union as a bargaining
partner.[38] Moreover, in dismantling national bargaining, the owners still
preferred multi-employer bargaining, though at the district level where
the union was weaker and where bargaining could be more closely related
to prices and profits.
A few points may be made here about the General Strike of 1926. For
the most part, employers did not use the defeat to abrogate agreements.
Many were indignant at what they saw as the breach of procedures and,
in some cases, they demanded trade union assurances and a stricter
wording of procedural agreements. Yet outside of the coalfields, no major
group of employers withdrew recognition at national or district level. At
shop-floor level there was some individual victimisation and further
undermining of workplace organisation; but, in terms of the balance of
bargaining arrangements, this served only to strengthen national as
against workplace bargaining.[39] Moreover, employers did not push for
further reductions in wages and conditions and in this respect the coal
owners were exceptional. Even during the depression years of 1929-33
wage cuts were nowhere near as large as in the early 1920s, and the index
of national wage rates fell by only 4.5 per cent between 1929 and 1933.[40]


-----

88 Continuities and change

Since prices were falling, this meant that real wages rose. The coal dispute
and the General Strike had demonstrated the high cost of set-piece
confrontation, and employers did not use the aftermath of the General
Strike to reshape the British system of industrial relations. Some, it is
true, did seek the removal of legal immunities for strikes and considered
the legal enforceability of agreements. However, employer pressure for
legal changes was neither universal nor particularly insistent.[41] After the
General Strike, the episode of the so-called Mond-Turner Talks between
leading businessmen and senior trade unionists also showed that British
employers were reluctant to introduce major changes.[42] Clegg has con-
cluded that 'on this occasion Britain missed an opportunity to reconstruct
its system of industrial relations to meet the requirements of the future'.[43]

Despite some novel ideas and much strong rhetoric, the Mond-Turner
proposals were essentially posited on the existing system of collective
bargaining, and the whole episode of the Talks suggests that most British
employers were unwilling to develop new initiatives in industrial rela-
tions.[44]

In the economic crisis of 1929-32 there were some further challenges
to the system of multi-employer bargaining. Whereas coal and engineer-
ing had provided the main test cases of collective bargaining in the 1920s,
cotton textiles became the major area of dispute in the 1930s. In that
industry the long-established national system of collective bargaining
collapsed â at least for a time. In order to force a wage reduction in
1929, the cotton employers locked out their workers for three months.
Then, in 1931, as competitive pressures intensified, the weaving employers
again used the lock-out in order to force their workers to accept a larger
complement of looms per weaver. This was not a new idea, but at the
time it was seen as more pressing and as a key aspect of managerial
prerogatives. However, the employers, confronted by strong worker oppo-
sition, were not completely successful in introducing new methods of
working. Frustration over their limited success, and union resistance to
industry-wide wage cuts and hours increases, led individual employers
to try to make their own arrangements. In 1932 both the weaving and
spinning employers' organisations decided to suspend all collective agree-
ments and to leave their member firms free to wring whatever concessions
they could out of their workforces at mill level. After several months of
conflict, the Ministry of Labour intervened, industry collective bargaining
was re-established, and a new price list was agreed which accommodated
more loom working. However, a more indirect threat continued in the
form of furtive undercutting of the collectively agreed rates, especially
by small and non-federated firms. This led the employers and unions to
look again to government and, in 1934, the Cotton Manufacturing

Employers, unions, and collective bargaining 89

Industry (Temporary Provisions) Act was passed, enabling national wage
agreements to be legally enforced throughout the industry. Thus, after
initial reverses, industry-wide multi-employer bargaining was restored in
the cotton industry in the mid-1930s.[45]

Engineering, coal, and cotton were the three most important industries
subjected to severe pressures on their collective bargaining systems. On
the other hand, there were industries where there was an extension of
multi-employer arrangements. In building, for example, the collective
bargaining system became more elaborate and grew in pace with the
extension of labour and product markets. Before the First World War,
bargaining took place at town or district level with wages adjusted in
response to local economic forces. During and immediately after the
war, in an attempt to control leapfrogging between districts, the
employers' associations extended the bargaining area to cover whole
regions. In 1920 it was again the employers' initiative which led to the
introduction of national wage regulation. Under this system, towns and
districts were graded nationally to enable wages to vary with differences
in the local cost of living, while, within each district, standard rates were
fixed for all building workers. Regional agreements on working rules
remained, but these had to be ratified by the national employers and
trade unions. The machinery did not always work smoothly in the first
decade of its existence. In 1924 the trade unions, feeling that wages were
being held back and dissatisfied with the constraints of the procedure,
threatened to secede. The employers responded with a national lock-out
to maintain the system. On other occasions, plasterers and bricklayers
tried to pursue sectional claims. In all cases, however, the employers
strongly supported and sought to extend the system. As the employers'
organisation stated: 'The National Federation of Building Trades
Employers will resist to the utmost of its power any action having for
its object the substitution of sectional methods of regulation, either
nationally, regionally or locally for the national industrial method of
negotiation at present in force.'[46] The arrangements in building and
related trades were underpinned by various local commercial arrange-
ments, price fixing, and collusive tendering.[47] In the steel industry the
national system of collective bargaining was elaborated and extended to
cover most workers in the industry. Here, wages continued to be fixed
according to a sliding scale based on variations in steel prices.[48] In
shipping, there developed a particularly close relationship between the
large shipping companies and the seamen's union, and an increasingly
comprehensive and uniform system of wages and conditions. In this
instance, the system of route sharing and rate fixing through the so-called
shipping conferences helped.[49] On the whole, the industries where


-----

90 Continuities and change

national agreements were most comprehensive and effective were those
which were either sheltered from foreign competition or where there
were collusive arrangements between firms. As an official report pointed
out, Trade competition by employers is a powerful factor in determining
to what extent the members of an association will adhere to a common
policy, and the action of non-associated firms in securing orders, or even
the fear of such action, must necessarily influence the associated firms.'[50]

**The theory and practice of industry bargaining**

Why did British employers choose to externalise their industrial relations
in the manner described above? What was the rationale on which this
system of multi-employer bargaining was constructed? These arrange-
ments had procedural, managerial, and wage advantages for employers.
Management conceded recognition to trade unions and, in return, the
unions agreed to work within the procedural arrangements and negotiat-
ing machinery.[51] Collective bargaining could take place at various levels,
but there was usually a mechanism to transfer issues to national level.
When a dispute arose at workplace level, it could be processed up through
the procedure and, very importantly from the employer's point of view,
while a case passed through the various stages, the union was obliged
to keep the peace and refrain from strike action. Overall, the aim of the
employers was to concentrate bargaining at national level where, if
necessary, they could deploy their full collective strength. It was also the
intention to restrict bargaining to a narrow range of issues and to retain
other matters as managerial prerogatives. In some agreements this was
explicitly stated in a 'management functions' or 'managerial prerogatives'
clause. The presumption was that, by concentrating bargaining at a level
external to the firm, management was more likely to prevent a successful
challenge to prerogatives within the firm. On matters of wages and
conditions, the employers' intention was that national agreements would
preclude lower-level claims and, by increasing standardisation, would
go some way to taking wages out of competition between firms. Thus,
to use Flanders's terminology, the arrangements offered employers both
_managerial control advantages within the workplace and market control_
advantages over wages in the marketplace.[52] All this is not to deny that
trade unions and their members got something out of these arrangements:
along with recognition, they acquired some check on employers and a
growing standardisation of wages and conditions, which were real
benefits in the period after 1920 when the unions were in no position to
dictate terms.

Employers, unions, and collective bargaining 91

Such, then, was the theory and rationale on which the system was
based. In practice, however, there was a wide gap between the theory
and the reality. This discrepancy varied between industries, between firms
within an industry, and over time according to changing economic
circumstances. It existed in terms both of procedural matters and wages
and conditions, as will be discussed below.
Though, in theory, machinery existed at three levels - workplace,
district, and national - with interlocking procedures, in practice most
firms had only rudimentary collective bargaining machinery at plant
level. During the war, some employers had set up joint works machinery
and, in engineering, the 1919 agreement formally made provision for
plant-level works committees, though in practice these were rarely estab-
lished. In Whitley industries the national joint industrial councils
encouraged works councils as part of the comprehensive system envisaged
in the report.[53] However, relatively few works committees and councils
were established and many of these did not survive the onset of
depression.[54] The survivors limped on as weak consultative bodies or as
the first stage of industry disputes machinery, usually upstaged by the
authority of the external procedure. The fact is that neither employers
nor national union executives were favourably inclined to plant-level
machinery. At company level, in the growing number of multi-plant
companies, there was hardly ever machinery which covered the whole
company and, in industry disputes procedures, there was rarely provision
for a company stage. Indeed it could be argued that the existence of
external machinery inhibited the growth of internal plant and company
arrangements. For the employers this had one apparent advantage in
that it discouraged the presence of union full-time officers in the work-
place. In engineering, for example, the disputes procedure laid down
that deputations of workpeople might be accompanied by their union
organiser, but in such cases a representative of the local employers'
association was to be present.[55] In other industries, firms were explicitly
disallowed by their employers' organisation from negotiating directly
with union officials or indeed even from communicating with them.[56]

The disputes procedures based on this machinery performed a valuable
function for employers who liked to stress the conciliation or peacekeep-
ing function of procedure. The unions, who raised the vast majority of
cases, were obliged to take each case through the various stages of
procedure and, while a case was going through, were obliged to keep
the peace. Most disputes were settled in the early stages and the further
a case went the less likely it was to be settled in the employees' favour.[57]

However, again, the use of the procedure was very much subject to
economic circumstances. In periods of economic upswing the number


-----

92 Continuities and change

of cases tended to rise, but so also did the number of disputes occurring
outside the procedure. Thus, as economic activity rose from the mid-
19308, workers started to take action independently of their unions. It
has been estimated that by 1936 half of the strikes in the engineering
industry were in breach of procedure.[58] Such unconstitutional action was
inevitable given the fact that the aspirations and activities of shopfioor
workers could not always be expected to coincide with the terms of
national agreements and given the often exasperating amount of time
taken to go through procedure. But, even when unconstitutional action
took place, the procedure was still of some use to the employer: the trade
union was placed in an 'unenviable position' and was under pressure to
discipline its members.[59]

The national systems were intended to uphold the rights of management
and to prevent trade union interference in the internal workings of the
firm. However, in practice, economic circumstances and production
requirements served to undermine formal rights. In engineering, for
example, the employers fought the 1922 lockout to reestablish their
prerogatives after the encroachments during the period from 1910
onwards. Their victory was overwhelming and certainly reduced shop-
floor power. But, despite the victory and the depression, there is evidence
that, in the more traditional sectors of the industry and the more skilled
departments within firms, craft unions maintained many of their tradi-
tional practices.[60] The employers' reluctance to invest in new production
systems, their dependence on craft work, and the weakness of managerial
control systems sustained these practices. During periods of economic
upswing management had to tread carefully. As early as 1934, for
example, when a shortage of skilled labour had become apparent in the
Midlands and the South, the EEF told its members:

The situation calls for the greatest discretion on the part of the management
and makes it most desirable that federated firms, before making any serious
changes in working conditions obtaining in their works (even though the
change may come within the category of a managerial act) should give the
Local Association an opportunity of seeing that the change, and the method
in which it is proposed to introduce the change, are in such order that no
justifiable objection can be taken to it by the trade unions whose members
may be affected.[61]

Even in periods of low economic activity, management often knew that
the effective implementation of change depended on the cooperation of
the workforce. Lower level management realised this even more and were
prepared to waive formal rights when these contradicted local custom
or threatened established practices.[62] From the mid-1930s, as unionisation

increased and as shopfloor organisation spread to less skilled employees,
worker confidence and assertiveness grew. Some of the practices which
had traditionally been the preserve of the skilled craftsman spread to
new areas of the expanding motor vehicle, aircraft, and electrical
engineering sectors.[63] Though these were usually less restrictive than
traditional craft demarcations and were often linked to bargaining under
piecework schemes, in time they came to constitute a real check on
managerial prerogatives. There is evidence of similar experience,
especially from the mid-1930s, in other industries, such as mining, build-
ing, steel, and shipbuilding.[64]

In the case of wages and conditions, there was also a gap between the
theory and the reality of the system. Again the actual form and extent
of this gap varied between industries and according to economic circum-
stances. In periods of downswing and depression the movement of rates
and earnings kept in step. However, at such times, the tendency was for
employers to offer less than the nationally agreed rates. In periods of
upswing and boom, the tendency was towards the payment of wages and
conditions above national rates. Thus, during the period from 1910 to
1920, and again from the mid-1930s through the Second World War,
there was a strong tendency for the increase in earnings to be faster than
the increase in nationally agreed rates.[65] Some of this greater increase
in earnings took the form of overtime, upgradings, and genuine produc-
tivity increases during rising economic activity. Much, however, took the
form of straight additions, fictitious extras, and 'easy' piecework rates,
reflecting both the employers' desire to attract and retain labour and the
enhanced bargaining power of work groups on the shopfloor. This ten-
dency also reflected the decentralised and weak managerial control
systems in British firms and the multitude of informal shopfloor under-
standings which this allowed.
This gap in wages was more or less of a problem according to the
intentions of the parties. Not all employers and unions intended that
national agreements should be tight and sufficient in themselves. An
important prerequisite for a tight, standard national agreement was the
homogeneity of firms in the industry in terms of product, labour, and
technology. Without a sufficient degree of homogeneity, there was
inadequate basis for collective action. Another important factor was the
ability and desire of the employers to control competition by taking
wages out of contention. Where this was not possible, because, for
example, of the large numbers of firms in an industry or its openness to
foreign competition, it was difficult to fix standard wages and conditions
and in these circumstances there were always undercutters. Where control

was feasible and where firms felt the need to stabilise the labour and
product market, it was more likely that wages and conditions would be
uniform between firms.
A number of contrasting examples may be cited. In engineering, there
existed a minimum time rate and a minimum piecework standard.
National bonuses were added straight on to earnings. This form of
across-the-board increase was favoured by the EEF because it allowed
equal additions to be made to timeworkers and pieceworkers without
substantially upsetting plant earnings structures and necessitating adjust-
ments in piecework times and prices. National bargaining during the
interwar years was about additions to and subtractions from the national
bonus. There was no further grading of workers and no attempt to fix
maximum wages at national level. Although periodically considered, this
was always rejected because of the complexity of the industry in terms
of firms, products, and types of labour and its openness to international
competition.[66] Standardisation would, moreover, have meant increases
in unit labour costs for some firms which they could not have covered
by increasing their selling price. Thus, only certain basic conditions were
standard - the length of the working week, overtime arrangements, and
shift premiums. The national wages system was therefore skeletal. During
periods of upswing, earnings rose both because of national increases and
workplace additions. At these times the tendency was for earnings to
deviate increasingly from the minimum time rates and from the minimum
piecework standard. The divergence tended to be greatest for
pieceworkers, especially, from the 1930s onwards, in sectors such as
motor vehicles and aircraft.[67] During periods of downswing, deductions
were made at both national and local levels and undercutting occurred.
Thus, the employers, acting collectively, provided a national framework,
but did not try to equalise wages between firms or to fix the actual
structure and level of earnings internally within the firm. A similar skeletal
structure existed in other industries such as shipbuilding, iron and steel,
printing, pottery, and chemicals.[68] The national framework in all these
industries was loose, and there was a gap between minimum rates, as
set for certain categories of workers, and actual earnings of workers in
the industry. Within each plant, earnings were determined by unilateral
management action, unwritten custom, and shopfloor bargaining depend-
ing on local circumstances.
By way of contrast, there were other industries where over the interwar
period the national system of wages and conditions became more uniform
and complete. Citing building as an example again, the wages fixed at
national level for each particular region were intended to be standard
as was the framework of working rules. There was some payment above


-----

Employers, unions, and collective bargaining 95

the standard in periods of high economic activity, and below in periods
of depression especially where non-federated firms posed a competitive
threat. However, the relative absence of pieceworking in the building
industry and the greater uniformity of methods of production helped
sustain a tighter national system.[69] In another section of construction,
the rapidly expanding electrical contracting industry, wages and condi-
tions became particularly comprehensive and uniform over the interwar
period. Here, despite a large number of small firms, both product and
labour markets were homogeneous and it suited both sides jointly to
control under- and over-payment. As the boundaries of product and
labour markets extended in this industry over the interwar period, so did
the geographical area of standardisation.[70] In cotton textiles, excepting
the set-backs of the early 1930s, the system of wages and conditions was
also tight, as also were similar national piecework price lists in footwear.
Other examples of tight national agreements were to be found in both
shipping and railways, where a relatively small number of big firms
cooperated with highly centralised trade unions to fix increasingly stan-
dard rates. Finally, there were a number of small compact industries
including flour milling, electrical cablemaking, papermaking, cement,
and bricks, dominated by a few firms and characterised by various
collusive product market arrangements, where also there developed tight
national systems of wage fixing.[71]

**The consequences of multi-employer bargaining**

What, then, were the consequences of national multi-employer bargaining
as it operated in Britain in the first half of the twentieth century? In
terms of its impact on the level of wages, it may have had a small effect,
slowing down increases during periods of upswing and prosperity.
However, against this must be set the possibility that employers may
have been more willing to make wage concessions under industry bargain-
ing since it was easier to pass these on throughout an industry in the
form of higher prices. The existence of earnings drift also compels some
scepticism about the effectiveness of multi-employer bargaining in hold-
ing down wages. The system may have had more effect in slowing down
the rate of decrease during downswings and depression by reducing the
flexibility of employers to adjust wages downwards. Though there were
many instances of wage cuts forced by employers' associations, it must
be remembered that after 1923 there were few changes in wage rates and
money earnings remained almost constant until 1937.[72] Certainly some
contemporary economists attributed the maintenance of wages, in a


-----

96 Continuities and change

situation of high unemployment, to the development of national collective
bargaining.[73]

In many industries, the system was also intended to take wages out
of competition between firms. In some cases it did this, either by equalis-
ing wages or wage costs. In the small flour-milling industry, for example,
it was stated that:

As a result of a national scale of hours and wages, there ceased to be
competition among employers as regards their labour costs and each
employer, by looking at the list of classified towns and areas, can easily
calculate his competitor's labour costs. This became a factor of considerable
importance in the development of the industry when commercial competition
between firms became so acute that the absence of competition in labour
conditions was appreciated.[74]

As market-sharing and price-fixing became stronger in this and other
industries, and as tariff protection grew from the early 1930s onwards,
employers often saw multi-employer wage fixing as a way of reinforcing
their product market arrangements.[75]

Collective employer offensives, as in engineering in the early 1920s or
cotton in the early 1930s, may have improved manpower utilization for
a time. But the assertion of managerial prerogatives by these means had
its limitations: it elicited coerced compliance for a time rather than willing
cooperation. Against any positive effect must also be set the fact that
under a system of external bargaining there was less scope for trading
off pay rises for productivity increases within the firm. Moreover, under
this multi-level system, in prosperous times, employers often paid twice,
making concessions at workplace level and again at national level. In
the latter case, increases were unrelated to differential rises in productivity
and prosperity between firms. Many employers were thus giving money
increases at national level for nothing in return, a situation which became
clear from the late 1930s onwards. One commentator noted in the late
1940s:

The sense of responsibility for finding and applying the best incentives has
been removed from the hands of individual managements along with the
responsibility for them. Workers obtain increases in wages without having
played any real part in formulating the changes... Most managements are
uneasily aware that, despite all national efforts, the problems of providing
adequate incentives remains in their hands. But they are equally aware that
the means to a solution have been taken from them. Hence management's lack
of lasting interest in the possibility of increasing output by providing stronger
incentives for their workers, and their prevailing feeling of frustration.[76]

Two further effects on industrial relations may be singled out. First,
the system may have helped contain disputes by mobilising collective


-----

Employers, unions, and collective bargaining 97

employer strength against the unions. However, with the advent of
depression these would have fallen anyway. On the other hand, it is
likely that industry bargaining increased the likelihood of both big
national disputes, as occurred in coal, engineering, and cotton, and of
short strikes outside the procedure, especially during economic upswing
and where the procedure was slow. Second, national recognition and
industry-level bargaining did nothing to deal with the inheritance of
multi-unionism in British industry. On the contrary, it encouraged it,
since some employers' organisations pursued a 'divide and rule' strategy.
A group of food manufacturers, for example, held that 'it was desirable
to have as many unions as possible to deal with, in order that, with
competition in this direction power should not be concentrated in the
hands of one union or one official'.[77] Membership of an employers'
organisation entailed recognition of any of the trade unions which that
association recognised, and reliance on national machinery and failure
to develop domestic arrangements meant that employers did not have
to think about sorting out representational questions within the firm.
Though employers and their organisations did not create multiunionism
and its allied jurisdictional and demarcation problems, equally during
this period they did little to reshape trade union representation within
the firm.

**Alternative choices**

It is relevant to enquire whether there was an alternative way of organising
representational and collective arrangements and whether some firms
developed their own internal arrangements within their companies.
Many medium-sized and small firms did not belong to employers'
organisations and, for such companies, all their dealings with employees
were internal within the firm. However, the majority of small firms did
not recognise trade unions and had no representational arrangements of
any kind. In some larger firms, there was also a tradition of dealing
exclusively or at least primarily with their own employees, without the
intermediary of an employers' organisation. Again, this included large
firms which refused to recognise unions. In this category are the gas and
railway companies before the First World War. In the case of the South
Metropolitan Gas Co., its in-house system of employee representation
and labour relations remained strong throughout the interwar years. In
the case of the railways, once they had recognised unions, the companies
established both a national system and an elaborate internal system of
company, station, and depot machinery.[78] Another category of firms
included those which recognised trade unions, but which dealt with them


-----

98 Continuities and change

exclusively or primarily without being members of employers' organisa-
tions. This included Brunner Mond, Lever Bros., Cadburys, Imperial
Tobacco, and the large Lancashire engineering firm of Hans Renold &
Co.[79] In some cases these arrangements consisted only of informal factory
meetings, usually of an ad hoc nature. In other cases there were more
elaborate committees of worker representatives to which trade unionists
could be elected, but which were not exclusively trade union based.
During the First World War, as we have already noted, there was a
growth of shop stewards' committees which periodically met with
management for negotiating purposes, and, in some instances, joint
standing works committees were created. The most radical recommenda-
tion of the Whitley Report was for the establishment of joint works
committees to discuss a wide range of issues internally within the work-
place, and over a thousand such committees were created under Whitley
auspices.[80] In the engineering industry, the 1919 shop stewards agreement
provided a formal basis for works committees, though very few were
established. However, after 1920, many such wartime bodies ceased to
function. From the outset, national unions had been distrustful both of
committees which might be dominated by management and of those
which might be dominated by shop stewards to the exclusion of the
national union. With the advent of depression, union leaders did little
to sustain these arrangements. However, a more important reason for
their lack of success was the hesitancy on the part of the employers, who
at best saw works committees as a way of dealing with production
problems and containing the upsurge of shopfloor activity during the
war. The majority of employers saw them as a potential threat to
managerial prerogatives and as unnecessary given the existence of exter-
nal machinery. They therefore did little to maintain them.[81] G. D. H.
Cole summed up contemporary attitudes in this way:

The trade unions feared that workshop bodies might fall under unofficial
control, subverting the influence of the national unions; and the employers
had mostly no intention of granting any real control and therefore would have
none of it in the sphere in which it was likely to be most real and effective.[82]

Again during the Second World War there was an expansion of internal
representation and consultative machinery. The number of shop stewards
and works committees negotiating directly with management increased.
From 1941 onwards, joint production committees were established in
many factories for discussing wartime production and welfare matters.
Mainly with the prompting of union activists and government, these were
established in engineering, aircraft production, shipbuilding, and coal
mining. By 1943, over 4,000 existed in the engineering and allied industries
covering over 2.5 million workers.[83] Often they operated in parallel with


-----

Employers, unions, and collective bargaining 99

joint shop stewards committees, sometimes under the control of the latter.
The success of the committees was mixed: some met only irregularly and
discussed marginal matters, while others provided an effective addition
to representational machinery within the plant. After the war, some
survived intact, others remained with more limited functions, while others
were integrated into shop steward machinery. However, many just ceased
to exist, and managements, some of whom had only reluctantly agreed
to committees in the first place, made little attempt to develop them into
permanent internal institutions.[84]

By this time, a distinction had been established in Britain between
collective bargaining and joint consultation. It was held that collective
bargaining between employers and unions was best concerned with
adversarial matters, such as wages and conditions, and that overall these
were best dealt with outside the firm. In contrast, there were topics of
mutual interest between employers and their workers which should be
handled in a cooperative manner. Relations within the plant should be
predominantly or entirely confined to such matters as were outside the
scope of collective bargaining. In fact, both conceptually and practically,
this was a difficult distinction to make and it had deleterious consequences
for the development of plant-based institutions in Great Britain. However,
the distinction suited most employers because it seemed to take dealings
with trade unions outside the firm while leaving consultation restricted
to a narrow range of issues and subject to the final decision of
management.
Despite this overall pattern, there were always some firms which had
the organisational capability and which chose to deal internally with
trade unions, often in addition to having their own consultative arrange-
ments. In this category were the food firms of Cadburys, Rowntrees, and
Frys, which had consultative machinery but which also recognised trade
unions and for the most part dealt with them internally within the firm.
The same applied to J. & J. Colman, Reckitt & Sons, and Imperial
Tobacco. Pilkingtons dealt directly with trade unions without belonging
to an employers' organisation or national industrial council. After the
collapse of the national agreement in rubber in the early 1920s, Dunlop
developed their own factory council, though in this case the clear aim
was to reduce trade union power. The classic case in the interwar years
of a large modern firm developing its own internal arrangements was
ICI. From 1926 onwards it constructed an elaborate consultative system
of works councils while also recognising trade unions. Its policy was
always to deal with the unions at company level through its Central
Labour Advisory Council. In the mid-1930s it left its employers' organisa-
tion and ceased to be a party to national agreements. Another large


-----

100 Continuities and change

merged company which left its employers' organisation in the 1930s was
the Lancashire Cotton Corporation, which established its own personnel
department and procedures specific to its own needs.[85] In addition, by
the late 1930s firms such as Unilever and Courtaulds, though still con-
nected with employers' organisations, had outgrown them or dominated
them to such an extent that membership did not matter. They in turn
were groping towards their own internal arrangements. Finally, it should
be added that many of the American firms which located in Britain in
the interwar years followed the pattern which their American parent
companies were establishing at this time â they chose not to join
employers' organisations and developed their own internal systems.
Singers on Clydebank and British Westinghouse in Manchester were two
such examples which refused to recognise trade unions and developed
their own internal systems. In the motor industry, Ford, for example,
gave the EEF a wide berth and, even after recognising unions in 1944,
refused to join the Federation. Vauxhall Motors left the Federation in
1921 and, after it was taken over by General Motors, never rejoined.
Briggs Bodies remained outside the Federation and it was only strong
pressure which induced Pressed Steel to join in the early 1930s.[86] These
and other firms had the capability to manage their own industrial relations
and wanted autonomy to determine wages and conditions as they wished.
There was, therefore, an alternative path which some big firms, often
leaders in terms of organisational development, were able to choose.
Overall, however, British employers found it easier to deal through
employers' organisations rather than develop their own plant, let alone
company, arrangements.

**Conclusion**

By 1920 a system of management-union relations had been created in
Britain which remained dominant into the 1950s. Through their asssoci-
ations, employers recognised trade unions for manual workers but, in
turn, tried to exclude union activity and bargaining from the workplace
and insisted on dealing with unions primarily through external pro-
cedures. In this way they created a framework of wages and conditions
at industry level. The economic and business circumstances of the inter-
war years tested the system, which on the whole survived. Indeed
depression sustained the system for it meant that power lay with the
employers, who were content to maintain what they had created;
similarly, increasing collusion between firms and trade protection re-
inforced these arrangments. In addition, the nature of company organisa-
tion encouraged this strategy: small, medium-sized, and loosely co-

ordinated larger firms, with weak managerial structures and hierarchies,
meant that most firms relied on the services of their employers' organisa-
tions. It was only a few exceptional firms which pursued alternative
strategies and tried to develop stronger internal arrangements.
However, the system was never as stable as it might have appeared.
It relied through the interwar years on economic depression and was
sustained by restrictive and protectionist tendencies in the product
market. Moreover it was built on a weak infrastructure. The machinery
did not usually provide detailed regulation at plant and, even less, at
company level. At the workplace, the employers' policy of seeking to
externalise management-union relations was never entirely successful -
traditional shopfloor practices survived or re-emerged when market con-
ditions became favourable. Such a multi-level system reflected both the
deep roots of workplace trade unionism in Britain and the inability of
management to follow through its national strategy of externalisation.
As early as the recovery of the 1930s, there were signs of instability which
took the form of wages drift and unconstitutional action. It was not until
the post-Second World War period, however, that the full strength of
this problem became clear and that employers were forced to develop
new strategies for dealing with industrial relations internally within their
companies.

### Markets, firms, and the organisation of production

This book has set the history of labour management in Britain in a broad
economic and business context. It has argued that the legacy from the
nineteenth century had a profound effect on the management of labour
in the twentieth century. The first half of the twentieth century witnessed
considerable changes in the structure of British industry which in part
modified that traditional pattern of labour relations. Markets, which had
at first been open and expanding, became subject in the interwar years
to growing restrictive and protectionist tendencies. Newer industries
based on mass-production technologies became firmly established. Cor-
porate structures also changed and there was a growth of large firms and
managerial hierarchies. However, there were also significant continuities
from the nineteenth century. Britain remained heavily committed to the
older staple industries and markets often remained highly fragmented
and differentiated. With the exception of the two world wars, the labour
market continued to be characterised by elastic labour supply. The large
firms which emerged at the turn of the century and in the interwar years
often remained loose federations of constituent companies with weak
managerial hierarchies. In this environment, it was argued, many British
employers retained traditional forms of work relations which were labour
intensive, which afforded skilled workers considerable autonomy, and
which constrained productivity growth. In terms of employment and
industrial relations firms, for the most part, chose strategies of externalisa-
tion and failed to develop strong internal structures of labour manage-
ment. Only a few exceptional firms, usually characterised by different
market, structural, and managerial configurations, pursued different
labour strategies and developed stronger internal structures of labour
management.
This chapter outlines changes in the economic and business context
of the post-Second World War period which led to more substantial
adaptations of the traditional system of labour management. The effects
of increased product market competition and full employment in the
postwar years are stressed. The chapter outlines the growth in company

size and developments in corporate structures and managerial hierarchies,
but it stresses that, well into the postwar period, these remained weak
and continued to constrain the development of managerial strategies.
The chapter also examines the management of production where the
Second World War and the postwar years revealed critical weaknesses
in work relations. Finally, it considers attempts by employers to deal
with the pressing problems of low productivity and to restructure the
organisation of work.

**Changes in the market context**

From an economic point of view, the postwar years may be divided into
three parts. The first, covering the phase of postwar adjustment from
1945 to 1951-52, was a period of severe economic and financial problems,
when people were unsure how long the recovery and full employment
would last. In important respects, however, British industry was well
placed in terms of world markets in that most of its productive capacity
was intact, demand was growing at home and abroad, and its European
and Japanese competitors had suffered much greater economic disloca-
tion. The second period covered the long boom from the early 1950s to
the early 1970s. These were years of unprecedented growth for the British
economy, interrupted only by short and relatively minor setbacks.
Through the 1950s, full employment came to be taken for granted and
an expectation of rising living standards was firmly established. However,
from the late 1950s onwards, British industry was subjected to more
severe competition in domestic and overseas markets. Through the 1960s,
among informed opinion, there was a growing awareness that in terms
of growth rates Britain was lagging behind other industrial countries. In
the mid-1960s, further problems began to accumulate as both inflation
and unemployment rose. The late 1960s marked the beginning of the end
of the boom period, though at the time this was only dimly perceived.
The third period may be taken as beginning in the early 1970s when
economic buoyancy came to a more decisive end. Thereafter, industrial
output fell in two major recessions, 1974-75 and 1979-81, the latter of
which was followed by a long period of recovery up to 1989. These two
recessions had world-wide origins but, in Britain, the problems they
caused had to be absorbed by an economy which for many years had
been growing relatively slowly and whose firms had been losing market
share both at home and abroad.[1]

Over the postwar period, structural change was considerable. At the
beginning of the period, the old staple industries of coal, textiles, ship-


-----

Markets, firms, and the organisation of production 107

building, and heavy engineering were still very important in terms of
output and employment. Thereafter they declined, while the newer indus-
tries which had grown in the interwar period - motor vehicles, electrical
products, synthetic fibres, and food processing - expanded, especially in
the 1950s. To these were added the still newer industries of
petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and consumer electronics. Both
employment and output in manufacturing rose up to the mid-1960s, but
from then on declined, steeply after 1979. This decline proceeded at a
faster rate in Britain than in other countries, reflecting increasing import
penetration and declining share in world exports of manufactured goods.
In historical perspective it is necessary to stress two further major
features of postwar markets which profoundly affected employers' labour
policies. One relates to the nature of the product market, the other to
the state of the labour market.
In terms of product markets, the most striking feature of the postwar
period was the increase in competition. Lower transportation costs and
better communications effectively widened the area of potential competi-
tion, in both domestic and international markets. The postwar inter-
national economic settlement involved a liberalisation of international
trade and an erosion of the protection which most British industries had
enjoyed since the 1930s. Each successive 'round' of trade liberalisation
involved a progressive opening of the markets of one country to another.[2]

Partly because of this, but also because of the import substitution policies
of newly independent states, traditional colonial and commonwealth
markets ceased to give preference to British goods. The creation of the
European Free Trade Association and the European Economic Com-
munity, and Britain's subsequent entry into the latter in 1974, also
widened the scope and intensity of competition. In all markets, the growth
of American, European, and Japanese competition meant an
intensification of competitive pressures. In these circumstances, British
exporters had to face the difficult task of trying to maintain their position
in traditional markets while progressively reorienting themselves to more
dynamic and competitive markets in Europe and N. America. At the
same time, within the British market, domestic forces were at work
increasing competitive pressures. The Monopolies and Restrictive Trade
Practices Act of 1948 stimulated a climate of opinion critical of restrictive
business behaviour which, as was argued in previous chapters, had been
a long-term feature of many British industries. The passage of the Restric-
tive Trade Practices Act in 1956 and the Resale Price Act in 1964 led to
a dismantling of many market-sharing and price-fixing arrangements
which had grown up, especially in the interwar period.[3] These circum-
stances together created a much more competitive market environment

which put strains on the national system of industrial relations and
prompted firms to pay attention to their systems of labour management.
In terms of the labour market, the long thirty-year boom from the end
of the Second World War was the first time ever in British economic
history that there was extended full employment. Comparing adjusted
figures, during the years 1874-1914 unemployment probably averaged
around 5 per cent; during the interwar years from 1920 it never fell below
10 per cent; whereas in the first twenty years after the Second World
War unemployment averaged 1.5 per cent.[4] Postwar full employment
resulted both from a slowdown in the growth of the male workforce and
high and stable demand for goods and services. Shortages of labour,
especially skilled labour, became a feature of manufacturing industry at
each cyclical peak in the 1950s and 1960s. It is true that over the postwar
period unemployment rose, but the rate of increase was slow until the
early 1970s, when unemployment first exceeded one million or 4 per cent
of the insured working population. A quarter century of full employment
and high demand for labour had profound consequences for industrial
relations, in particular threatening the stability of workplace relations
and the industry-wide system of collective bargaining. It also had an
important effect on employment relations, encouraging the growth of
internal labour market-type arrangements in British firms.

**The further growth in company size**

Growth in aggregate demand and the size of markets led to a further
increase in the large-firm sector in Britain. Some of the increase in
company size came from internal growth as markets and technological
developments offered opportunities for firms to expand. At the same
time the increase in market competition and opportunities also led to a
further growth of mergers and, in Britain more than in other countries,
firms grew by acquisition. From the mid-1950s the number of mergers
fluctuated around a rising trend with peaks in the mid-1960s and the
early 1970s.[5] As a result of the mergers and acquisitions of this period
some of the largest British firms in the electrical engineering, aerospace,
motor vehicle, and food, drink, and tobacco industries were created.[6] A
particular feature of this period of mergers was the growth of the multi-
product firm, as companies diversified in order to reduce their reliance
on a single product range and in order to take advantage of market
opportunities in several industries. In Channon's sample of the largest
100 British companies, for example, only one quarter were diversified in
1950, whereas the proportion had risen to nearly half by 1960 and to
around two-thirds by the early 1970s.[7]


-----

Markets, firms, and the organisation of production 109

Growth by both internal expansion and acquisition led to an increase
in employment in the largest enterprises. The average size of the top 100
firms increased from 20,300 employees in 1958 to 31,180 in 1972, and
the number of manufacturing enterprises with employment in excess of
5,000 rose from 180 in 1958 to 210 in 1963.[8] ICI and Unilever, which
before the war had been the largest manufacturing employers with 50,000
or more employees, had by the early 1970s been joined by around 25
other firms in the same size category and by that date ten firms employed
100,000 employees or more.[9] In terms of manufacturing net output, the
share of the top 100 firms rose from 26 per cent in the early 1950s to
41 per cent in 1968.[10] A similar picture is shown by the evidence on market
concentration as represented by the proportion of net output accounted
for by the top five firms in an industry: by the end of the 1960s the five
largest firms accounted for 90 per cent or more of net output in nearly
a quarter of all industries.[11] Indeed, by then the degree of concentration
in Britain had surpassed that found in the USA and Germany. However,
taking the size of individual firms, Britain's largest companies were still
smaller in terms of turnover than their American counterparts. In sectors
such as motor vehicles, electrical and electronic products, and chemicals
and pharmaceuticals, the largest British firms were also smaller than
those in Germany and, by the 1970s, in industries such as steel, shipbuild-
ing, motor vehicles, and electrical products, they had been overtaken in
size by the Japanese. Moreover, in these sectors, plant size in Britain
tended to be smaller and many British firms had a large number of plants.
In 1958 the 100 largest manufacturing companies had an average of 27
plants; by 1972 this number had risen to 72 and was spread over a larger
number of industries. This reflected the defensive nature of many British
mergers and the failure to rationalise organisation and production.

**Problems of organisational change and continuing managerial**
**weaknesses**

The growth in company size and the increase in merger activity from the
early 1960s created severe organisational and managerial difficulties for
British firms. The speed and size of acquisitions and mergers posed
coordination problems as the number of subsidiaries and plants increased
and the various layers of managers grew.[12] Horizontal and vertical mer-
gers raised problems of integrating and rationalising formerly competing
and overlapping units, and diversification created particularly complex
problems of coordination and control across a number of industries. All
these problems had to be confronted by managerial hierarchies which

in Britain continued to be less well trained and integrated than in many
foreign countries.
In the immediate postwar period, most firms retained their traditional
organisational structures. Thus, the majority of the largest firms remained
loose-knit, decentralised holding-companies, with weak management
hierarchies and control systems. Acquisitions usually meant the addition
of further units to already loose federations without thoroughgoing
structural reorganisation. Where firms were previously centralised and
organised on functional lines, merger and acquisition often resulted in
the grafting on of new subsidiaries. In this way, some hitherto centralised
firms became more like holding-companies, with newly acquired sub-
sidiaries subject to little central control.[13] Before the mid-1960s, very few
British firms had adopted the multidivisional form of organisation where
a company was separated into product divisions, each allowed operating
autonomy, but subject to head office strategic monitoring and control.[14]

Such a form of organisation had been tentatively developed by a few
firms in the interwar years but, as Channon has shown, only about a
dozen of the largest firms operating in Britain had a divisional structure
in 1950 and a number of these were subsidiaries of American parent
companies. In the 1960s the number of firms organised on these lines
increased, but by the end of that decade still only about one third of the
largest British firms had developed multidivisional structures.[15] However,
growing competition and reduced profitability through the 1960s and
1970s made organisational change even more urgent[16] and, by the mid-
1970s, around three quarters had adopted a multidivisional form of
organisation of some kind, while others strengthened their more cen-
tralised, functionally departmentalised structures.[17] These changes
allowed growth to be more effectively managed and allowed new strategic
initiatives to be taken, including in the area of labour management.
However, two major sets of reservations must be registered concerning
improvements in corporate structure in Britain. First, growing as they
often did out of holding companies, these new structures tended to be
weaker than their American counterparts - with smaller senior manage-
ment hierarchies, less well-defined and articulated divisions, and weaker
head office planning systems. They were also weaker than their German
and Japanese counterparts which tended to maintain more centralised,
functional forms of organisation.[18] In some cases, in Britain, divisional-
ised firms tended to act like financially driven conglomerates with
insufficient integration of production and marketing strategy. In the 1980s
financial pressures have led in some cases to what is probably an excessive
devolution of responsibility with only financial control remaining at the
centre. This has raised doubts about the feasibility of the development

Markets, firms, and the organisation of production 111

of strategy in the labour management area.[19] Second, at about the same
time that structural reforms were taking place, a new set of challenges
had arisen. A further wave of mergers and acquisitions in the late 1970s
and 1980s, the increased importance of institutional investors, and the
growth of what has been termed a 'market for corporate control' began
to have important implications.[20] Senior managers had increasingly to
worry about the threat of hostile takeover; more importance has had to
be placed on short-term profits and share prices rather than long-term
growth and market share; and takeovers have led to British firms, often
still groping towards improved corporate structures, being bought, dis-
membered, or reconstituted as subsidiaries of bigger, often foreign,
companies. These phenomena also occurred in the US, where they are
generally thought to have had deleterious consequences on company
performance. They have not happened to the same extent on the Con-
tinent or in Japan where firms have concentrated more on strengthening
their corporate structures and long-term capabilities.
To manage the increase in size and complexity, through the postwar
years there was a growth in the number of managers at all levels. As we
have seen, this was part of a long-term trend. The ratio of administrative,
technical, and clerical staff in manufacturing industry rose from 19 per
cent in 1948 to 27 per cent in 1958 and 34 per cent in 1968.[21] By then,
British firms had caught up with, and even surpassed, foreign firms in
terms of the size of their managerial hierarchies. However, in terms of
quality there were still considerable deficiencies.[22] In firms which retained
a loose holding-company form of organisation, family management often
persisted, both at main board level and in the constituent companies.
Even in some of the better organised companies structured on functional
or multidivisional lines, there were vestiges of family control and, when
smaller firms were acquired, family members were often retained on
subsidiary boards.[23] Though some family members could provide real
benefits to firms in terms of experience and commitment, by no means
all family managers were trained or knowledgeable, and family back-
ground often meant the existence of a considerable gap between senior
and lower level management. The overall impression given by various
surveys of senior British managers in large companies in the 1950s and
1960s was that they continued to come largely from the top social classes;
about half of them had been to private school; and, of the minority who
had been to university, they tended to have been to Oxford or Cambridge
where they were more likely to have studied arts subjects rather than
science, engineering, or business-related subjects.[24] Herein lay a contrast
with other major industrial countries. In the US, family control declined
earlier and firms had long been run by university-trained professional

managers. Other countries, especially Germany, Japan, and France, also
made more rapid strides in the postwar period towards developing
well-trained professional managerial hierarchies.[25] Of course, there were
British firms which were well managed at the top and which had effective
management development programmes. The ability of such firms to
recruit and develop graduate managers would suggest a demand side
failure rather than a supply side constraint: most British firms did not
seek to recruit or develop their managerial cadres in the manner of
Japanese, German, and American firms.[26]

However, there were some signs of improvement, especially from the
mid-1960s onwards. Along with the merger movement and structural
reorganisation, there was an attenuation of family participation at main
and subsidiary board level. Increasingly at main board level, full-time
professional directors replaced owner-directors. The educational attain-
ment of British management also improved as younger managers, with
better formal qualifications, began to work their way up the management
hierarchy.[27] This included an increase in the numbers trained in science,
engineering, and business administration. Again a caveat must be reg-
istered. Though there were some improvements in the quality of British
management, considerable problems still persisted in terms of training.
Management training in Britain probably came to overemphasise general
business management and to place less emphasis on technical training
as was stressed in Germany and Japan. In Britain the finance function
often dominates and accountants are more likely to get to the top of
firms than engineers or production managers.[28] Studies in the 1980s have
shown that British management on the whole still remains less well
educated and trained than its American, European, and Japanese
counterparts.[29]

These weaknesses may have been particularly acute at lower levels in
the management hierarchy. Middle managers in Britain were likely to
have worked their way up through the company's ranks and, in the
production area, in industries like engineering and shipbuilding, many
were ex-craft apprentices. These were less well educated and formally
trained than their overseas counterparts and probably on the whole less
open to new management techniques.[30] At the base of the management
hierarchy, the position and status of the foreman had for some time been
progressively eroded and encroached upon by line managers and specialist
departments. In Britain this continued through the Second World War
and postwar period, despite some attempts at the training and upgrading
of supervisory staff. Overall, the vast majority of foremen in British
industry were recruited mainly from manual jobs, were usually selected


-----

Markets, firms, and the organisation of production 113

in an ad hoc, casual manner, and received little further technical or
managerial training.[31] Moreover, higher level management seems to have
been less concerned to integrate them into the management team. One
recent study suggested that, The major break in the vertical structure of
British companies comes between shopfloor supervision and management
proper, rather than between supervision and shopfloor.'[32] The weakness
of supervisory staff in Britain posed problems for the management of
production and industrial relations. For example, it has often been
observed that foremen have acquiesced in or colluded with various
shopfloor customs and practices. Though this phenomenon is to be found
in many countries, it was probably more pronounced in postwar Britain,
given the weakness of managerial control systems above and the strength
of shopfloor trade unionism below.[33]

Turning finally to personnel management, this was given a considerable
boost by the Second World War when, in large part at government
prompting, more personnel managers were appointed and specialist
labour departments established.[34] The numbers of managers with this
title rose substantially from about 2,000 in 1939 to over 5,000 by 1945.
Thereafter, through the next two decades, there was a slow increase in
their number. However, not all firms employed formally qualified
specialists and few gave the personnel function board-level representa-
tion.[35] Overall, the majority of personnel managers in Britain lacked
formal qualifications and personnel management remained relatively low
status in the management hierarchy. Their role was usually administrative
and reactive rather than strategic or proactive and, in dealings with trade
unions, much was still left to employers' organisations. It was only later
in the 1960s, as labour problems accumulated, that the number of person-
nel managers again rose, increasing from about 15,000 in the mid-1960s
to around 50,000 by the late 1970s.[36] By the late 1970s, most large firms
employed specialist staff and many had for the first time appointed main
board directors with responsibility for personnel management.[37]

However, smaller and medium-sized firms often still did not have person-
nel managers, and foreign-owned firms were more likely to have
specialists both at plant and board level than their British-owned counter-
parts.[38]

Weaknesses in corporate structures and managerial hierarchies lay
behind many of the labour management problems of the 1960s and 1970s
and constrained managerial labour strategies. Such improvements as
there were in structure and hierarchy in those decades provided a basis
for changes in labour strategies in the 1970s and 1980s. Continuing
weaknesses, combined with an excessive decentralisation and an

emphasis on short-term financial considerations, have remained a con-
straint on the development of labour strategies.

**The changing technological context**

The Second World War had accelerated change in both old and new
industries engaged in war production. In this respect the speed and scale
of change in war-related industries was much greater than during the
First World War. In the key engineering sector new factories were built
and many more extended and reorganised. Along with this went a
considerable introduction of new machine tools, many imported from
the US. Better practices in terms of standardisation, quality control, and
flow line production spread from government 'shadow' factories and
from larger firms to smaller firms and sub-contractors.[39] More than during
the First World War there was cooperation between management and
labour and a willingness to relax traditional practices.[40] One historian
of the war economy has gone so far as to conclude that, The technical
changes in production processes during the Second World War went a
long way towards ending the distinction between "artisan" and "work-
man".'[41] However, the Second World War also highlighted many of the
weaknesses of British industry. There were severe problems of scheduling
production and inefficiencies in industries such as machine tools, aircraft
production, and shipbuilding. In the coal mining, steel, and shipbuilding
industries, new equipment and changes in work organisation were
limited.[42] Increases in production were often obtained by an increase in
the labour force and a more extensive (longer hours) and more intensive
(speed-up) use of labour. But this had its limits. At the end of the war,
the reports of the Anglo-American Productivity Council showed graphi-
cally that productivity per head was much lower in the UK than in the
US and that this could in large part be ascribed to the slower introduction
of new labour-saving technologies.[43]

In the first quarter century after the war economic circumstances
combined to bring about a period of technical change more rapid than
in any previous period in British history. Investment in plant and equip-
ment was higher than ever before and British firms had the opportunity
to catch up with a backlog of technological advances, many imported
from the US. There were substantial changes in machines and processes
and in the flow and transfer of materials. In steel making, electric arc
and, later, basic oxygen furnaces took over from open-hearth methods
of production; in engineering, there was a further introduction of more
sophisticated machine tools; in coal mining, machine cutting and power
loading were extended throughout the nationalised coal industry. In


-----

Markets, firms, and the organisation of production 115

consumer-goods industries there was also rapid technological change.
In artificial fibres high-speed spinning of new fibres such as nylon and
polyester were introduced; in the rapidly growing pharmaceutical
industry new mass-production and packaging techniques were adopted;
and in brewing and baking new faster processes made possible the
larger-scale production of more standardised foodstuffs. In the case of
material and product flow, there was an extension of assembly-line
techniques; in motor-vehicle plants automatic transfer machines were
introduced which moved parts through various operations and improved
the speed and accuracy of machining; and more mechanical and pneu-
matic handling was installed throughout industry. There occurred an
accelerated movement from batch to continuous process production in
industries such as glass, cement, paper, sugar, soap and detergent
manufacture. In the chemical, oil-refining, and petrochemical industries,
more sophisticated instrumentation was introduced which increased the
volume and speed of throughput. At all stages of production a greater
degree of automation and control was achieved with the more extensive
use of electronics and, from the 1960s onwards, computer-controlled
processes.[44]

However, two qualifications relevant to the themes of this book must
be added to this overview of technological change in postwar Britain.
First, most of the new production techniques were introduced from
abroad, especially from the US, and in terms of the diffusion of technical
processes Britain often lagged behind best-practice technologies
abroad.[45] In older industries such as textiles, many firms continued to
rely on spindles and looms which foreign firms had long since abandoned
and British firms were slow to introduce new automated machinery. In
shipbuilding, the installation of mechanical handling, welding, and pre-
fabrication systems and standardisation lagged behind Britain's main
competitors. In steel making, British firms did not lead in the introduction
of basic oxygen processes, continuous casting, and other new methods
of integrated steel production.[46] In newer areas such as machine tools,
British firms failed to capitalise on a promising start in the development
of numerically controlled machines, and the same occurred in the increas-
ingly important computer industry.[47] Second, the main advantages which
manufacturers had to gain from technological innovation were increased
quantity and quality of output, reductions in costs, and improvements
in productivity. Where labour considerations were important, it was
usually in terms of savings in manpower and in most cases simple
deskilling was not an objective.[48] Of course, there was some deskilling,
especially with the introduction of mass-production methods in industries
such as motor vehicles and electrical products and in continuous-process

industries such as steel and glass making. On the other hand, much heavy
manual work disappeared and the introduction of new plant and
machinery often meant more skilled operative, maintenance, and tech-
nician jobs. However, it was felt by a growing number of managers and
policy-makers that there was a labour problem for British manufacturers
and this was how to match competitors in terms of productivity growth.

**The productivity problem**

The postwar years saw the most rapid and sustained growth in production
and productivity in British economic history. Over the quarter century
1948-73, gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of about 2.8 per
cent and productivity (as measured by gross domestic product per
employee hour) at about 2.4 per cent. By comparison, over the years
1870-1914, output had grown at approximately 1.9 per cent per annum
and productivity increased by about 1.1 per cent. In the interwar years
1922-37, output had grown by about 2.3 per cent and productivity by
2.0 per cent per annum.[49] Not only was there an improvement over earlier
periods, but also through the postwar period up to 1973 productivity
growth was on a rising trend. Thus, in the manufacturing sector, produc-
tivity accelerated from 2.2 per cent annually in 1955-60, to 3.2 per cent
in 1960-64, to 3.4 per cent in 1964-69, and to 4.5 per cent in 1969-73.[50]

This came to an end, however, with the onset of recession in 1973.
Between 1973 and 1978, productivity increased at only around 1.0 per
cent per annum and, between 1979 and 1980, disappeared altogether
before recovering strongly from 1981 onwards.[51]

However, the problem for Britain was that, though productivity growth
over the postwar years was good compared to earlier periods, it lagged
significantly behind other major competitor countries. The productivity
gap between Britain and the US, with its origins in the late nineteenth
century, had widened significantly in the 1920s and 1930s, and other
industrial rivals, such as Germany, had developed a clear tendency to
improve productivity more rapidly. The Anglo-American Productivity
reports after the war showed that most British firms were less well-
equipped with up-to-date machinery and less well-laid out than their
American counterparts and the gap between the good and the bad was
very wide indeed in Britain.[52] Contemporary academic studies confirmed
these findings and showed that, though the US productivity advantage
varied from one industry to another, there was an absolute lead in almost
every industry and this was particularly marked in the mass-production
industries.[53] In the post-1945 period, industries in Germany, France,
Japan, Italy, and a number of other countries successively passed Britain


-----

Markets, firms, and the organisation of production 117

in terms of productivity growth, and progressively, in the 1960s and
1970s, this opened up a significant gap in absolute levels of productivity.
Though the origins in these disparities may be traced back before the
war, the relative deterioration was greater and more sustained during
the postwar period.[54] By the early 1970s manufacturing output per head
in West Germany and France was about 50 per cent higher, and in the
US over 100 per cent higher, than in Britain.[55] The productivity gap was
particularly large in the important metal-working and engineering group
of industries - steel, motor vehicles, shipbuilding, mechanical and elec-
trical engineering.[56] Aggregate measures of productivity differences have
been confirmed by more detailed comparisons of matched firms and
plants. All these studies, both macro and micro level, have problems of
data collection and reliability and some may overstate the productivity
shortfall. However, cumulatively they show significant differences in
productivity growth.[57]

Increasingly through the postwar period these productivity problems
came to be seen by many as a problem of labour. Of course, labour
productivity is merely a measure of output over labour and it implies
nothing about the causes of productivity. However, among employers,
politicians, and public opinion formers, Britain's poor performance was
increasingly attributed to labour inefficiencies and inadequate industrial
relations. From the 1960s onwards, these beliefs, reinforced by a further
perception that profits were being squeezed,[58] induced employers to
search for changes in the management of production.

**Employer strategies and the organisation of production**

It was argued in Chapters 2 and 3 that through the nineteenth century
traditional work methods persisted or changed only slowly, reflecting
the structure of markets, the nature of firms, and an employer preference
for labour-intensive methods of production rather than investment in
new plant and equipment. The late nineteenth century and the interwar
years saw important process innovations and changes in work organisa-
tion and the spread of mass-production methods. However, overall, the
rate of change was gradual and patchy. This is not surprising given the
exceptional fluctuations of demand during these years and the reluctance
of the many small and medium sized firms to risk the heavy investment
and overheads implied by large-scale modernisation and reorganisation
of their production processes. Even larger firms often lacked the organisa-
tional capability to push through changes in production. Moreover, in
Britain the relatively plentiful supplies of unskilled and skilled labour
encouraged the maintenance of labour-intensive methods. Where British


-----

employers did try to deal with the problems of productivity, they often
resorted to an intensification of work within existing technologies and
relied on other employment policies and strategies of externalisation to
control and motivate labour.
During the Second World War management sought to raise produc-
tivity in various ways. As already stated, there was an extension of
scientific management techniques in the war industries involving the
application of work study and the introduction of payment-by-results
systems. In addition, there was a greater use of motion and method study
directed at problems of standardisation, lay-out, scheduling, and quality
control.[59] From 1941 onwards managements accepted the establishment
of joint production committees whose aim was to deal with production
problems and improve productivity and wartime circumstances enabled
management to obtain the suspension or abandonment of many restrictive
practices.[60] However, in qualification, it should be stressed that wartime
changes were uneven between and within industries. For example, in
shipbuilding and iron and steel, reorganisation was limited, and outside
of the armaments industries, change was minimal. Much of the increase
in production during the war came from longer hours and an increase
in the intensity of work. This, however, had its price and wartime
conditions simultaneously led to an increase in trade union bargaining
power which constituted a real or potential check on management.
After the war there was a growing recognition among more informed
and perceptive observers of the shortcomings of British industry as
evidenced by the work of the Anglo-American Productivity Council. This
body, established at government initiative and with American prompting
in 1948, was made up of management and union representatives. Its aim
was to investigate the sources of Britain's poor productivity performance
and to make recommendations for improvements. To this end, it des-
patched study teams to the US and produced a series of reports.[61] Overall
the various studies identified a real productivity gap between British and
American industry which they attributed to slower introduction of labour-
saving technologies and new methods of production. Though in part the
reports referred to poor employment and industrial relations in Britain,[62]

they placed more emphasis on levels of investment and managerial
failings, especially in the production area.[63] As one team of managers
and accountants concluded, 'the greatest single factor in American indus-
trial supremacy over British industry is the effectiveness of its manage-
ment at all levels'.[64] Though the findings of the Council attracted consider-
able interest, in practice they had little effect in stimulating change in
industry. Though in some quarters there was a recognition of the problem,
there was overall considerable complacency, created by the perceived


-----

Markets, firms, and the organisation of production 119

success of wartime industry and the continued myth of Britain as a great
power.[65] There was some union opposition to the reports and the govern-
ment did little to see that they were implemented. However, the main
ambivalence towards the findings was on the part of British management
who either did not read the reports or who did not believe what they
read. Moreover, in a seller's market immediately after the war and before
the removal of many restrictive trading agreements, it was all too easy
for British manufacturers to ignore the recommendations and to continue
with inefficient practices.[66]

The post-Second World War years were very different from the period
after the First World War and certainly the years after 1920. In a situation
of rising product demand, continuing full employment, and under a
Labour government, British employers were not in a situation where they
chose to launch a concerted attack on workplace inefficiencies and trade
union practices as a way of dealing with problems of costs and produc-
tivity. In part this was because British unions were relatively strong and
on the whole were not at first perceived as being strongly opposed to
technological change.[67] In large part the failure to confront the unions
was on the employers' side: they lacked the organisational capability at
both national and company level to mount a frontal attack; moreover,
in an economic climate of buoyant demand, sheltered by continued
protectionism and restrictive trading agreements, and in a political cli-
mate of consensus, they lacked the motivation and determination to press
home such an attack. This absence of an employer offensive was in
contrast to the situation in the US and Japan where more belligerent
employers challenged unions and asserted managerial control over the
production process. Equally in Britain, employers did not seek to pursue
a more cooperative strategy as was being pursued in some Continental
countries such as West Germany and Sweden at the time.[68] This was
evidenced by the fact that many employers let their wartime joint produc-
tion committees lapse and put nothing new in their place.
However, in the 1950s competitive pressures on British firms increased
and employers resorted to various measures to increase output and to
improve productivity. There was an extension of shiftworking, especially
in industries such as chemicals, motor vehicles, and food processing.
Shiftwork rose from around 10 per cent of all workers in manufacturing
in the late 1940s to 20 per cent in 1964 and 25 per cent in 1968.[69] A more
dubious response was the increased use of overtime working which rose
from one hour per week above normal hours in 1947 to six by 1965. This
often had negative consequences, not least in that it encouraged make-
work practices in normal hours.[70] In certain industries, such as textiles,
transport, and foundry work, there was increasing recourse to the use of


-----

120 Challenges and adjustments

cheap immigrant labour prepared to work long hours often on antiquated
production processes. There was also an increased use of women,
especially married women, though again employers saw them as a source
of cheap labour rather than a productive resource to be trained and
developed. In addition there was also recourse to the traditional British
management strategy of piecework which seemed to offer immediate
returns without any major changes in production processes or methods
of working. Payment-by-results systems grew and were extended to
industries such as chemicals where they had previously been rare. Again,
however, this had disadvantages and caused industrial relations problems
as will be discussed in Chapter 8.
In the postwar years the use of so-called scientific management tech-
niques increased in Britain. In a few large firms there was an introduction
of operational research involving the application of mathematical tech-
niques to problems of stock control, scheduling, and production.[71] More
widespread was the growth of work study and its two main techniques,
method study and work measurement. Method study involved the investi-
gation of alternative ways of organising work, on the basis of which,
work measurement could then be applied to establish the time taken to
carry out a job. In practice, in Britain, however, the method-study stage
was given less prominence, and management was more enthusiastic about
work measurement as the basis for bonus schemes.[72] Overall, however,
it is true to say that the 1940s and 1950s saw the main advance of formal
scientific management techniques in British industry. Large companies,
such as ICI, Unilever, Pilkingtons, Dunlop, Rolls Royce, and Lucas, set
up their own work study and management services departments, while
others employed one of the many consultancy firms operating in the
area. The professional associations in the field, established during and
after the Second World War, such as the Society of Industrial Engineers,
the Work Study Society, and the Institute of Industrial Technicians, grew
in membership and other more established associations, such as the
Institutes of Mechanical and Production Engineers, introduced work
study into their exams in the 1950s.[73] Though some of these techniques,
such as operational research, were pioneered in Britain and though other
aspects of scientific management were well understood, on the whole
British industry lagged in the incorporation of such techniques into
production engineering and workplace management.[74] The uncertain
development of new organisational forms and management hierarchies
over the first two postwar decades were an important reason why British
firms were slow in adopting new management techniques. At the top,
many senior British managers espoused a 'gentlemanly' and 'generalist'
approach and talked more about the need to improve 'human relations'


-----

Markets, firms, and the organisation of production 121

rather than production techniques; while middle and lower level
managers still prided themselves on being 'practical' men and emphasised
'experience' and 'feel' rather than technique.[75]

A wider recognition of a problem of labour productivity came in the
1960s as international competition and labour market pressures
intensified. The belief grew that problems of industrial relations were
the main cause of poor performance and this led to the beginnings of
new policies in this area, the course and outcome of which will be
described in more detail in Chapter 7. One response to the perceived
cause of the problems was the development in the mid-1960s of so-called
productivity bargaining. In this, a number of large companies, aware of
international comparisons, played a leading part. Thus, Esso, prompted
by low productivity in its Fawley refinery, was one of the leading firms.[76]

Productivity bargaining, as it developed, involved detailed company- or
plant-level negotiations and the explicit linking of wage increases to
specific changes in working practices. The most common of such changes
included reductions in overtime working, reduced manning levels, and
greater interchangeability among workers.[77] At the same time, there was
also a move away from piecework and towards time-based systems where
_inter alia the intention was to increase flexibility in labour deployment_
and to reduce resistance to change in working practices. These changes
often also involved an extension of work study techniques, with the result
that by the late 1970s about half of all manufacturing establishments
were making use of them.[78] In the process of productivity bargaining,
management came to bargain more openly about matters which it had
traditionally regarded, formally at least, as managerial prerogatives and
in this way there was an extension of the scope of joint regulation in
industry. By 1969, about 3,000 productivity agreements had been signed
covering six million workers or a quarter of the labour force.[79]

Some have argued that productivity bargaining in particular, and the
more general industrial relations reforms of this period, made little or
no contribution to increased productivity. Workers, it is contended,
created new restrictive practices and, from the late 1960s onwards, under
pressure of incomes policies, productivity bargaining was devalued and
subsequently declined.[80] Industrial relations reforms more generally
merely increased the power of workplace unionism and constrained
management.[81] Though it is true that managements were not always able
to take advantage of the changes and though there were incursions into
'managerial prerogatives', such pessimistic conclusions are ill founded.
In the circumstances of the time, management was attempting 'to regain
control by sharing it'[82] and they felt that the reforms were worth having.
Also, it should be remembered that there was some acceleration of


-----

122 Challenges and adjustments

productivity growth in the late 1960s and early 1970s and some of this
may be attributable to productivity bargaining.[83] Certainly it is possible
that the deceleration of productivity growth from 1973 onwards may
have been even greater in the absence of such reforms. At the very least,
the notion of productivity bargaining and other industrial relations
reforms were a prerequisite for productivity improvements.
A somewhat different approach adopted by some firms in the 1970s
centred on what came to be known as job redesign. This had its origins
in part in concerns about productivity, but also in the 1970s with concerns
about absenteeism, labour turnover, and other worker dissatisfactions.
Job redesign involved a range of different projects and techniques involv-
ing rearrangements in factory production methods. Job enlargement meant
combining several tasks into one larger job. Job enrichment involved
combining jobs of different levels of skill and responsibility, including
work scheduling and quality control normally done by supervisory staff.
Other approaches involved an extension of these techniques to a whole
work group, allowing the group more discretion in planning and organis-
ing their work.[84] All of these started from the premise that the subdivision
of labour had been taken too far with deleterious consequences, especially
low morale and a lack of adaptability and flexibility. A number of large
firms were interested in various forms of job redesign.[85] However, this
was usually on an experimental basis, involving one plant or part of a
plant. On the whole most British managements were hesitant. For them
the costs of introducing such systems included the cost of new machinery
and plant layout, the retraining of staff, and the need to develop new
relationships with workers. There was also some doubt as to the general
applicability of such systems and British managements were probably
on the whole more conservative than many of their counterparts overseas.
Even at its height the pursuit of job redesign was limited and its effects
modest.[86] However, in so far as an important element concerned flexibil-
ity, there is a backward link with the productivity bargaining of the 1960s
and a forward link with new concerns of the 1980s.

**A new era of technological innovation and work organisation?**

In recent years it has been argued that, from the 1970s onwards, a set
of factors have combined to bring about a period of accelerated techno-
logical innovation and a major managerial effort to restructure work
relations.
To take technological innovation first. Heightened competition,
recession in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and a long recovery later in
the 1980s gave firms the incentive and the opportunity to adopt new,

Markets, firms, and the organisation of production 123

best-practice production methods. New techniques, based on microelec-
tronics, have become more readily available with a wide variety of
applications. As such technologies have also become progressively
cheaper and as foreign manufacturers have increasingly installed them,
British firms have had little option but to follow suit. Some observers
have gone so far to argue that this constitutes a revolutionary transition
from mass-production methods based on so-called Fordist lines, involv-
ing the close supervision of machine-paced work, towards more
specialised and flexible systems of manufacturing. Firms, it is contended,
have to respond more quickly and flexibly to demands for greater variety
and quality in more competitive markets. The adaptability inherent in
computer-controlled production systems makes such 'flexible specialisa-
tion' possible. In terms of work organisation this means a move away
from highly fragmented jobs towards more skilled and flexible work.[87]

Current changes in work organisation therefore in part result from
technological innovation. However, they have also come about because
of managerial efforts to restructure working arrangements quite indepen-
dently of technological change. In Britain, since the late 1970s, a number
of factors have made this both desirable and possible from management's
point of view. The need to regain competitiveness, economic fluctuations,
and a changed political environment have given management the impetus
and have provided the opportunity to restructure working arrangements.
Much attention has been given to dramatic changes in working practices
introduced by management in certain large public-sector corporations
such as British Leyland, British Steel, and British Coal and in a number
of private-sector firms in the newspaper printing, television, and shipping
industries. Less widely publicised, though more important in a broader
perspective, a larger number of manufacturing firms have introduced
new more flexible working practices through negotiations with trade
unions. These have involved cuts in manning levels, reductions in
demarcations, and the enlargement of jobs.[88] There has also been an
increased managerial interest in team working and other methods aimed
at involving workers in solving production and quality problems.[89]

It is still too early to evaluate such recent developments, but drawing
on recent surveys and case studies and with the benefit of a historical
perspective, a number of tentative points can be made.[90]

First, it may well be true that microelectronically-based technologies
do represent a new stage of mechanisation and automation of production
processes and it is clear that such technologies have a wide applicability
in much the same way as did the coming of electricity at the end of the
nineteenth century. However, in the British case a qualification is
necessary. Among the major industrial nations, Britain has not been a


-----

124 Challenges and adjustments

leader in the diffusion of new technology.[91] Net new investment in
manufacturing plant and equipment was low, relative to gross domestic
product, in the 1970s, compared with the 1950s and 1960s; it fell dramati-
cally during the recession of the early 1980s and then increased sig-
nificantly in the subsequent recovery, though it remained low in terms
of levels and growth compared with other major industrial countries.
Productivity growth, which should be a consequence of rapid technologi-
cal innovation, has also been no higher through the 1980s than in the
1950s and 1960s.[92] In the British case, the diffusion of new technology
has been uneven between and within industries and often piecemeal
within firms.
Second, in the changed circumstances of the 1980s, managements have
undoubtedly been able to bring about some significant restructuring of
working practices. This has been especially true in terms of the reduction
in manning levels and greater flexibility across previous job boundaries.
However, in the latter respect, change has often been modest, especially
between maintenance and production workers and within maintenance
areas and has not resulted in broad flexibility and multi-skilling of the
labour force. Major changes in this respect have been confined to a
minority of plants, and the gap between these and the majority is often
still large.[93] As significant as these changes in the restructuring of work
have been reductions in manning levels and a shift in power on the
shopfloor. This has led some analysts to draw the following conclusions.
Given the uneven and piecemeal diffusion of new technology and the
often modest changes in working arrangements, what increase there has
been in manufacturing productivity in the 1980s, compared to the 1970s,
has come as much from plant closures, reductions in manning, and a
tightening of managerial control.[94] In this respect, there are certain
similarities with other periods in British history, especially the 1890s and
the 1920s and 1930s, when there was also a reassertion of management
control and an intensification of work.
Third, to take up the theme of managerial intentions and effects on
skill. Most studies suggest that managements have introduced new tech-
nologies and methods of working in order to increase productivity, reduce
costs, and obtain better quality. Certainly these changes cannot be seen
simply as an attempt to deskill and thereby control labour.[95] In some
industries, such as printing, it is true that change has eliminated tradi-
tional skills, downgraded others, and reduced worker control over the
production process. In most industries, however, change has deskilled
some jobs but reskilled others. Manual dexterity and electromechanical
skills have become less important, but they have been replaced by
electronic and diagnostic skills and the need to work across job boun-

daries. However, between firms there has been considerable variation in
how skills are organised, reflecting differences in managerial competence
and choice. Where managements have the ability, where training is
available, and where good industrial relations exist, there is more likely
to be an upskilling of work; where the reverse applies, management is
less likely to upgrade staff and more likely to retain customary patterns
of hierarchical control.[96] There is also evidence of variation between
countries in the application of new technologies: in Britain it would
appear that managements have attempted to retain tighter control over
new processes and have been less likely to upskill than in West Germany
or Japan.[97] In part this might be explained by low-trust industrial relations
in Britain. However, though adversarial industrial relations are stronger
in Britain and though British unions have put a price on the introduction
of organisational change, most evidence suggests that unions have not
opposed technological change.[98] More important constraints shaping the
introduction of change would seem to be national differences in manage-
ment and training. New technologies and flexible methods of working
require sophisticated managerial competencies, including understanding
among top management and technical and organisational expertise
among middle and lower managers. They also require well-qualified and
trained workers to operate the new systems flexibly and effectively. In
Britain lower levels of managerial competence and skill deficiencies on
the shopfloor have been major constraints on the introduction of new
technology and working practices.[99] It may therefore be best to see recent
developments in Britain not as a new era, but as a further stage in the
long history of attempts to improve work relations and increase produc-
tivity performance.

**Conclusions**

This chapter has argued that in the post-Second World War period, there
were significant changes in the environment within which British
employers pursued their labour policies. The 1950s and 1960s were
decades of rapid technological innovation; however, long-standing weak-
nesses persisted in the management of production technologies and the
organisation of work. In the product market British firms faced heigh-
tened competition both at home and abroad. In the labour market, for
nearly three decades, employers had to contend with full or near-full
employment. The labour market situation eased from the mid-1970s, but
product markets became more volatile and competition continued to
intensify. At firm level there was in the 1950s and 1960s a growth in
company size and complexity in part resulting from a new wave of

mergers. Initially, this led to limited change in corporate structures and
managerial hierarchies: loose holding-company arrangements predomi-
nated and managerial hierarchies remained weak. It was only from the
mid-1960s onwards that significant improvements have occurred in these
areas, though still insufficient relative to major competitor countries.
Throughout the predominant problem facing British industry has been
relatively low productivity growth. To overcome this, over the years,
British managements have tried in various ways to restructure working
arrangements, with some success, especially from the 1960s onwards.
However, this has been constrained by lower levels of investment by
British firms in production facilities and in organisational capabilities.
It has also been constrained, though to a lesser extent, by continued
shortcomings in terms of industrial and employment relations. These are
the subject of the next two chapters.

### Industrial relations: challenges and responses

Industrial relations are considered in this chapter before employment
relations because of the importance which they assumed in British labour
management in the period after the Second World War. It is true that
in the early post-war years there was considerable complacency about
industrial relations arrangements. However, industrial relations slowly
emerged as a major problem for British management and assumed serious
proportions for employers from the 1960s onwards. This chapter will
analyse the nature of that problem, the employers' response, and the
changes which occurred in the institutions of industrial relations.
The industrial relations pattern which had been established in the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was based on employer recogni-
tion of trade unions and collective bargaining with them through the
agency of employers' associations external to the firm. In this way national
agreements were established for most British industries laying down
procedures and setting basic wages and conditions. By 1945 there were
about 500 separate national institutions in which employers' organisa-
tions negotiated with trade unions.[1] Internally, within the firm, in many
industries, there had long existed rudimentary shopfloor bargaining with
work groups and their representatives, but the strength of these varied
with economic circumstances and arrangements were seldom formalised.
During the upswing from depression and the war years, trade union
membership grew considerably, reaching a peak in 1948 of 9.4 million
or 45 per cent of the workforce.[2] This was accompanied by an increase
in union organisation and bargaining activity at the workplace. The
wartime introduction of joint production committees and the more gen-
eral need to consult workers strengthened workplace bargaining. Simul-
taneously the war extended and consolidated the national or external
system of collective bargaining. Between 1939 and 1946, as many as 56
joint industrial councils or similar bodies were established or reestab-
lished.[3] The wartime Conditions of Employment and the National
Arbitration Order of 1940, familiarly known as Order 1305, also
encouraged industry bargaining in that it allowed nationally agreed terms

and conditions to be imposed on non-federated firms. This in turn assisted
recruitment to employers' organisations and strengthened national agree-
ments.[4]

There were, however, gaps in the structure and strains had emerged
from the mid-1930s onwards. With the revival from depression, there
was an upward drift of earnings over and above national rates with the
result that, in a number of industries, national agreements less effectively
regulated actual pay.[5] Along with this went an increase in the number
of unofficial strikes. Despite this there was little criticism of the system
nor much attempt to reform it. During the war there was little time for
reform, and immediately after the war there seemed little need for an
industrial relations system fundamentally different to that in place. Thus,
as has already been suggested in Chapter 6, there was after the war no
attempt by British employers to reform or redirect the system of industrial
relations such as occurred in the US, Japan, and West Germany.[6]

**Trade union membership and organisation**

Total trade union membership rose more slowly in the two decades after
1948 than the labour force, with the result that density fell slightly from
45 per cent in 1948 to 43.7 per cent in 1967. Underlying these aggregate
figures were important changes. Manual union membership remained
more or less stable throughout the 1950s and 1960s, but since there was
a reduction of employment in strongly organised industries such as coal,
textiles, and railways, this reflected an increase in organisation in other
newer industries such as motor vehicles and chemicals. Ford, and its
body supplier Briggs, two of the last industrial bastions of non-unionism,
recognised unions in 1944. The oil and chemical companies which were
building new refineries and petrochemical plants during and after the
war recognised rather more willingly. Only a few large firms held out
against recognition for manual workers. White collar union membership
increased throughout the post-war period, though because this was less
than the rate of growth of employment until the late 1960s, density among
white collar workers fell.[7]

An important feature of trade unionism in the war and early post-war
period was the development and diffusion of shop steward organisation.
As has already been noted, shop stewards had long existed in craft
situations and had even been formally recognised by the Engineering
Employers in 1919. Elsewhere recognition was accorded more informally,
but both formal and informal recognition increased considerably during
and after the war. By the early 1960s, shop steward organisation was
firmly established beyond its craft and engineering bases. Overall the


-----

number of stewards increased faster than union membership. Between
1947 and 1961, for example, the number of stewards accredited by the
AEU rose by 56 per cent as compared with a 30 per cent increase in
membership of the union.[8] The result was that, by the mid-1960s, there
were probably 175,000 shop stewards in British industry.[9] In most
medium-sized and large plants in manufacturing, management had come
to bargain with them over a widening range of issues. Indeed, given the
weakness of managerial hierarchies and control systems in many British
firms, employers sometimes relied upon them for the effective manage-
ment of industrial relations at plant level.
From the early 1950s, a number of factors combined to produce a set
of industrial relations problems. First, high levels of employment
strengthened the bargaining power of workers and curtailed the power
of employers who were increasingly in competition with one another for
labour. Second, in a situation of buoyant product demand, employers
were prepared to make concessions to their work forces since they
preferred a rise in labour costs to a loss of output. Third, increased
product market competition, as a result of the factors described in Chapter
6, meant that employers were on the whole less willing to cooperate with
one another and were under pressure to deal internally with labour cost
competitiveness. In terms of the conduct of industrial relations, this had
fundamental consequences in four areas - collective bargaining struc-
tures, restrictive work rules, strikes and procedures for handling disputes,
and the level of wages and labour costs. Each of these will be examined
in turn.

**Collective bargaining structures**

The structure of collective bargaining, as it had developed in Great
Britain, was skeletal and subject to recurrent strain in periods of economic
upswing. In terms of wage arrangements, in many industries, only rates
for certain classes of labour were fixed nationally - usually a rate for
skilled men and for labourers, while other rates were fixed at workplace
level. The tendency in the post-war period was for nationally determined
rates to be exceeded in the form of wage drift, that is a widening margin
between formally negotiated rates and actual earnings.[10] This growing
disparity came about in a number of ways. In a situation of full employ-
ment and high demand, employers were prepared to offer various supple-
ments above national rates in order to attract and retain labour and to
secure effort. The increased use of payment by results, during and after
the war, accentuated this tendency. Since incentive schemes could rarely
be devised at national level, they had to be worked out and implemented


-----

130 Challenges and adjustments

within the factory. Here the fixing of piecework times and prices provided
ample opportunity for bargaining, and piecework rates tended to work
loose and drift upwards.[11] Increased product market competition pressed
directly on bargaining structure in several ways. The weakening and
abandonment of collusive market arrangements reduced the solidarity
of employers and increased competition.[12] In turn, the extension of the
market to include foreign competitors made it difficult to bring in all
producers and this put pressure on employers to search more for plant-
level cost-minimising solutions. In addition, in many British firms, bar-
gaining levels were further complicated by the existence of multiunion-
ism. Employers confronted by different unions for adjacent or even the
same group of workers encountered difficulties in coordinating bargain-
ing, problems of demarcation, and leapfrogging wage claims. This was
in contrast to countries such as the US, West Germany, and Japan where,
in their evolving collective bargaining systems, the levels and units of
bargaining were better defined and more formal.[13]

Wage drift fluctuated between and within industries and varied over
time with changing economic circumstances. In general, the gap between
negotiated rates and actual earnings tended to widen.[14] This was most
pronounced in the engineering, shipbuilding, and metal manufacturing
industries where national agreements had been the most skeletal, where
wage structures were most chaotic, and where shop steward organisation
was best developed. From the war years onwards, earnings in these
industries greatly exceeded basic rates.[15] Studies of the engineering
industry show that the level of earnings and the degree of drift also
varied within the industry between sectors and firms.[16] Interfirm vari-
ations may in part have been due to differences in labour productivity
and profitability and differences in the bargaining power of work groups
between firms. However, various studies suggested that a large part of
wage drift was caused by reliance on piecework systems and the tendency
for these to work loose. This in turn often reflected weaknesses in
managerial hierarchies and control systems.[17]

In other industries, for example building, general printing, textiles,
and papermaking, the degree of workplace wage drift was less. Here
national agreements were more comprehensive and work groups and
stewards were less powerful. In cotton textiles and footwear, the national
system was supported by the fact that national piecework price lists were
in operation.[18] In a few industries, for example shipping, baking, and
cement, national agreements remained strong well into the post-war
period or, as in electrical contracting, even became stronger.[19] These
tended to be relatively homogeneous industries, sometimes with
administered prices and where strong relations had grown up between


-----

Industrial relations: challenges and responses 131

national unions and employers' organisations. Overall, however, in the
main sectors of manufacturing industry, national agreements became
more and more ineffective at least in large and medium-sized firms and
increasingly the purported advantages, both market and managerial, of
multi-employer bargaining were not realised.

**Restrictive work rules**

A second main problem area for management, which grew in the 1950s
and became more serious in the 1960s, was restrictive job control. In
previous chapters it was suggested that there was some diminution in
customary labour practices in the 1920s and early 1930s, and later during
the Second World War there was some relaxation of job controls to meet
wartime production needs.[20] On the other hand, from the upswing of the
1930s onwards and through the Second World War, there was more
opportunity for work groups to impose restrictions on management, and
these activities spread to new industries such as motor cars, aircraft
production, and electrical engineering. Overall, the impression is that,
in the postwar period, under the pressure of buoyant demand and full
employment, job controls and restrictive labour practices were extended,
reestablished, or newly created. National agreements could not deal with
details of work organisation which were therefore left to plant and shop
arrangements. In traditional craft industries, such as shipbuilding and
printing, rules on apprenticeship, demarcation, output, and the use of
new equipment remained strong.[21] In the newer motor-car industry,
workers were gradually able to impose restrictions on manning levels
and line speeds.[22] Even on a greenfield site, away from the main centres
of the industry, and in a well-managed company like Ford, management
could not prevent the growth of restrictive job controls at its Halewood
plant.[23] In an entirely new industry, oil refining and petrochemicals,
restrictive practices grew up covering matters such as work rules and
overtime.[24] Here, and in other continuous process industries such as
chemicals and steel, one of the main problems was in the maintenance
area where manning levels were high and craftsmen insisted that they
alone should do certain jobs. Along with higher labour costs, this
frequently meant high levels of down-time with plant and equipment.[25]

Throughout industry in the postwar period, there was a considerable
growth of overtime working, with levels rising from an average of one
hour per week above normal hours in 1947 to six by 1965. The fact that
overtime in part fluctuated with demand would suggest that it existed
for good economic reasons. But, since it fluctuated within only a narrow
range and, by most international standards, was high in Britain, there is


-----

132 Challenges and adjustments

reason to believe that much of it was created and maintained as a form
of job control and a way of boosting earnings. Workers, often with
management collusion, spun out work during normal hours in order to
ensure overtime with its associated premium rates of pay.[26]

It is difficult to say how widespread and how harmful these practices
were in terms of economic efficiency. In many firms in industries such
as shipbuilding and printing, they constituted real problems for manage-
ment. In other firms the extent and effect may well have been exaggerated
by managers.[27] However, for a growing number of employers, they were
perceived as a serious problem and in popular discussion it became
common to blame such practices on trade unions.[28] In fact, outside of
craft areas, official unions usually played little role in their creation or
maintenance and they were rarely the subject of formal agreements.[29] It
is more correct to see them as the creation of work groups and shop
stewards. In addition, numerous studies have also shown that manage-
ment action and inaction contributed significantly to the existence of
restrictive practices. Where senior management were uninterested or
ignorant about the shopfloor, where company structures were weak, and
where lower level managers were inadequately trained and coordinated,
there was often a failure of management control and shop stewards took
advantage of this.
Generalising from the famous case of the Fawley oil refinery, where
a range of restrictive practices had grown up in the 1950s, Flanders
commented, 'The truth is that the vast majority of managers in British
industry prefer to have as little as possible to do with labour relations';
when problems occurred, their reaction was 'to play for safety and to let
well alone'.[30] In the steel industry, a US Steel Company delegation sent
to investigate the relatively tranquil industrial relations enjoyed by the
British industry in the 1950s concluded that relations were good precisely
because British managers refused to face up to the real issues and allowed
inefficient working practices to proliferate.[31] In national newspaper print-
ing (admittedly an extreme case) an official enquiry concluded about
restrictive practices, 'We consider that the employer must carry his share
of the responsibility for failing to remove the sense of insecurity which
accounts in large measure for the workers' attitude.'[32] Studies in the
engineering industry suggested that the weakness of managerial control
systems was crucial in creating and sustaining restrictive practices. In
Lupton's study of an electrical engineering firm, various restrictions on
output and perversions of the company's piecework system had grown
up in the 1950s. In a buoyant market and protected by collusive trading
arrangements, top management was insufficiently aware of, or concerned
about, what was happening on the shopfloor. In these circumstances,


-----

Industrial relations: challenges and responses 133

lower level management and foremen were susceptible to pressure from,
and able to make concessions to, the shopfloor.[33] In a later study of a
number of engineering firms, Brown showed how weak managerial con-
trol and information systems and plain errors of management at all levels
allowed restrictive customs and practices to emerge. Once precedents
had been set, the power and determination of workgroups and their shop
stewards ensured their continuation.[34]

**Strikes and disputes procedures**

Though immediately after the war the number of strikes fell, there were
ominous signs of impending conflicts since, in some of the main export
industries such as motor vehicles, parts of engineering, and chemicals,
strike activity rose.[35] From the early 1950s there was an upward trend in
the number of stoppages, triggered initially by the collapse of the Labour
government's incomes policy, the subsequent change in government, and
price rises initiated by the Korean war. Between 1953 and 1959 stoppages
outside coal mining rose by 79 per cent; 1960 saw a massive increase in
stoppages, when the non-mining total first exceeded 1,000, and
throughout the 1960s there was a more or less continuous growth in the
number of stoppages. Between 1960 and 1968 non-mining strikes rose
by 85 per cent, working days lost by 83 per cent, and the number of
workers involved by 283 per cent, and by 1968 the total number of strikes
had exceeded 2,000.[36]

Though there were some large national stoppages in the late 1950s in
engineering, printing, and transport, most strikes during this period
covered only a single plant or department and were of short duration,
reflecting the changes in bargaining structure referred to above. In addi-
tion an increasing proportion of the strikes in these years were unofficial
(in that they took place without the prior authorisation of the national
union) and unconstitutional (in that they took place before an agreed
procedure had been exhausted). The average strike in the early 1960s
directly involved around 500 workers and led to the loss of about 1000
working days; it was estimated at the time that unconstitutional and
unofficial strikes made up 95 per cent of all stoppages and accounted
for two thirds of the total number of days lost.[37]

Underlying the rising strike trend were economic factors such as full
employment and rising prices and social factors such as rising expecta-
tions and a less deferential workforce. The trend also reflected institu-
tional factors such as the growing organisation and assertiveness of shop
stewards and the weakness and inability of collective bargaining pro-
cedures to cope with the changed circumstances.[38] The fragmented nature


-----

134 Challenges and adjustments

of workplace bargaining, as we have described it, led to sectional stop-
pages over matters such as relative wages, the application of incentive
schemes, and working arrangements at shopfloor level. Meanwhile,
national disputes procedures were unable to contain the growing number
of such disputes, and increasingly both management and unions found
these procedures cumbersome and remote.[39] In engineering, for example,
from its initiation on the shopfloor, through both formal and informal
meetings at works level, to local conference and to central conference,
with possible reference back, the hearing of a dispute could take several
months. With a larger number of cases going through procedure, the
time taken to go through the various stages rose, the disposal rate fell,
and the number of breaches of procedure grew.[40]

Industry-wide procedures were not designed for particular issues or
individual firms. As a study of the motor-vehicle industry concluded:
'One reason for the high strike level of car firms and of the federated
firms in particular, seems to be that the present organisation, attitude,
agreements and conciliation procedure of the employers' association
provide no effective basis for the settlement of the major issues in dispute
between the firms and their workers.'[41] Few plants had their own internal
procedures other than those laid down in national agreements, and even
fewer companies had procedures which allowed disputes to be taken up
through the company.[42] The absence of company procedures was in part
because membership of employers' organisations was usually on an
individual plant rather than a company basis, and the practice was for
each factory management to process its own disputes through the pro-
cedure. It was thus difficult for management in multi-plant companies
to coordinate their activities. Again to take the motor industry, the study
previously mentioned concluded:

Procedure requires that formal reference from the plant management
concerned should be not to the company's head office but to the local
engineering employers' association and then to the Engineering Employers'
Federation itself.... Even in some big recent stoppages, it has been unclear
whether the company concerned or the employers' association was handling
the matter at issue.[43]

Despite the above, a word of caution must be added. It is possible to
exaggerate the deleterious effects of strikes on British industry through
these years. For example, it has been pointed out that most British
employers in the 1950s or 1960s were never confronted by a strike or the
threat of a strike. Employers most likely to be affected were in mining,
motor vehicles, shipbuilding, and port transport and within these indus-
tries strikes tended to be concentrated in a few large plants.[44] Differences
in reporting the incidence of strikes make international comparisons

hazardous, but they do broadly show that Britain was not too badly
placed in terms of the proportion of working time lost through strikes.
The USA was always higher; Japan was higher for a time in the late
1940s and early 1950s; and Canada and Italy also tended to be higher
through most of these years. However, some of Britain's main European
competitors, W. Germany and France, were consistently lower. Moreover,
over the course of the 1960s, Britain's relative position deteriorated.[45] In
addition there was a growing feeling in Britain, at least among employers,
that small 'wildcat' strikes were more damaging in that they were less
predictable than the larger official strikes which took place, for example,
in the US or W. Germany. As one British employers' representative
noted: The impact of a strike of this character is much less severe than
the more frequent unconstitutional strikes which are so typical of the
British situation.'[46]

**Levels of wages and labour costs**

The final problem area for management concerned wages and their effects
on costs, prices, and profits. These effects were threefold. First, for the
firm, an increase in money wages, which was not offset by a commensurate
improvement in productivity, meant higher costs. Where prices could be
increased, without loss of market share, this was less of a problem, at
least for the firm. But, in a hard market environment, rising unit labour
costs and price increases threatened the firm's competitiveness. Second,
where labour costs were rising faster than productivity and where a firm
could not pass on its growing costs in higher prices, its profit margins
were squeezed. In turn, this could discourage investment and threaten
the longer term viability of the enterprise. Third, frequent changes in
wages and prices caused greater uncertainty for the firm, uncertainty
about how the wages and prices of competitors would adjust and about
the future demand for the firm's products. In these circumstances it
became increasingly difficult for the firm to price its products and to
assess its rate of return. In addition, frequent adjustments in wages
involved other costs, not least of which was the possibility of strike action.
For a long time, British manufacturers had been unaccustomed to
dealing with the consequences of a strong upward pressure on costs and
during the war many operated under cost plus contracts which meant
that commercial pressures on them were weak. After the war, in the new
market conditions of high demand, firms were at first able to cover higher
costs by higher prices without appreciable loss of business. Overall,
during the early 1950s money wages rose no faster in Britain than among

its main competitors. But, since productivity growth in Britain was lower,
unit labour costs rose more rapidly. From the late 1950s to 1964 money
wages abroad rose faster than in Britain and though the productivity
differential remained, unit costs in Britain grew less rapidly than in
Germany, France, Italy, or Japan, but faster than in the US. However,
from the mid-1960s, wages began to rise faster in Britain while relative
productivity lagged and, as a result, relative costs in Britain increased
rapidly. Devaluation in 1967 provided a temporary respite. However, as
earnings in Britain began to accelerate from about this time and as relative
productivity growth did not improve, competitiveness had been largely
lost by 1973.[47] Through these years also, as was shown in Chapter 6, the
product market was becoming more competitive. Increasingly these fac-
tors, together with growing trade union wage pressure, began to affect
profits.[48] The profit rate, which had been falling slowly since the mid-
1950s, fell more rapidly from the mid-1960s, and it has been estimated
that, between 1964 and 1973, net profits fell by nearly a half.[49]

Of course all this is not to say that industrial relations factors were
the only, or indeed the main influences on costs, competitiveness, and
profits. However, from the mid-1960s onwards British employers increas-
ingly saw industrial relations as crucial.

**Reforming industrial relations**

Between the late 1960s and the late 1970s important changes took place
in British industrial relations which constituted a significant transforma-
tion of the system. In terms of one of the themes of this book, this may
be seen as a movement away from strategies of externalisation and a
movement towards a growing internalisation of activities within the firm.
It was a slow and unsteady transformation, since the problems were
deep-rooted and in some respects getting worse. The economic situation,
while it acted as a spur, also compounded the problems. After 1969,
wage and price increases accelerated to higher levels and fluctuated
considerably, and productivity growth lagged behind the growth of wages
by more than in any other peacetime period. Together, the rapid rise in
money wages, lower productivity growth, and increased competition
combined further to reduce profits.[50] In the face of accelerating price
inflation, from 1969 trade union density began to increase, especially
among white-collar workers. By 1974 it passed 50 per cent of the labour
force and by 1979 had risen to an all-time maximum of 55 per cent.[51]

Along with this, shop steward organisation spread and became more
assertive in challenging management, and workers showed a greater

willingness to use strike action. This was the background to reform in
these years.
The origins of reform can be traced back at least to the early 1960s.
Though, after the war, employers' organisations and national bargaining
were taken for granted, there was a growing questioning of their role
and function in some large firms. For example, Samuel Courtauld voiced
this view in the 1940s when he said, 'Employers are not by any means
always well represented by their existing associations, many of which
are quite out of date. They were created long since to meet conditions
now vanished, but they are very difficult to replace or reconstruct.'[52]

Courtaulds itself had outgrown the employers' organisation which served
its industry. Other large firms which were similarly only loosely connected
with their employers' organisations were ICI, Unilever, Imperial
Tobacco, Pilkingtons, Distillers, the large breweries, Cadburys, Tate &
Lyle, British Sugar Corporation, and some of the other large food and
drink companies.
In the engineering industry there was also some questioning of the
role of the EEF and the usefulness of national bargaining. The 1950
national agreement was an attempt to get away from national across-the-
board increases for all workers and to confine industry-wide increases
to the lower paid actually on or near minimum rates. This proved
unsuccessful in the face of opposition from trade union members who
received no national increase and so pushed for one at workplace level.
In these circumstances, there was an increase in the number of federated
firms which favoured the national agreement becoming a looser safety
net.[53] In 1957 the Engineering Employers again attempted to stand firm
against an annual general wage claim but, faced with a strike and the
lack of government support, the Federation backed down.[54] After this a
number of large firms, including Vickers, AEI, Standard Motors, Rootes,
Rolls Royce, English Electric, Bristol Aeroplane, and General Electric,
combined to criticise the bargaining arrangements and wage structure in
the industry and some of the federated motor-car companies considered
leaving the national agreement.[55]

A number of official enquiries drew attention to the problems of
national bargaining and complicated wage structures. Academic com-
mentators also began to point to the growing significance of plant bargain-
ing and to suggest that wage determination should be confined largely
to that level.[56] This was a difficult message for the employers' organisa-
tions to accept since it implied a diminution of their powers and raised
the spectre of leapfrogging. It also came up against vested interests on
the union side. However, through the 1960s a number of employers'
organisations came to accept the changed situation, partly at government

prompting, but mainly because this was what their members wanted. The
1963 'package deal' in engineering represented a departure: it covered
a three-year period; while giving small general across-the-board increases
to all, it provided for a minimum earnings level which gave an increase
only to those who fell below it; and it attempted to link pay increases
to productivity increases. This latter was not particularly successful
because, as one representative of the Federation said, 'whilst the money
has been conceded nationally, the changes which we were trying to buy
were largely changes at the level of the factory'.[57]

Developments were also taking place in other industries. In 1967 the
British Rubber Manufacturers' Association negotiated a new type of
agreement for their industry. This abandoned across-the-board increases
of the 'something for nothing' kind and fixed a minimum earnings level
which was not be used as the basis on top of which plant additions were
calculated. The explicit objective of the agreement was to transfer wage
determination inside the plant, and to relate earnings increases more
closely to internal productivity.[58] Similarly, in 1968 the Chemical Indus-
tries Association signed an agreement with the unions which stated that
company and plant arrangements should govern how national agreements
were to be applied.[59] Other employers' organisations came to recognise,
albeit grudgingly in some cases, that national agreements were increas-
ingly to be 'safety nets' rather than 'floors' - in other words, when raised
they would only affect those actually earning the minimum rate and
would not jack up the rates of everyone else in the industry.[60]

Another important development in the early 1960s was the growth of
productivity bargaining, to which reference has already been made in
Chapter 6. The origins of this type of bargaining are usually attributed
to the agreements signed at the Esso oil refinery at Fawley in 1960. In
an international productivity comparison, the American parent company
had discovered that Fawley showed up badly in terms of labour produc-
tivity. Faced with growing competition in the industry, consultants were
brought in and the outcome was a series of wide-ranging productivity
agreements. Management, unfettered by industry agreements, gave sub-
stantial wage increases in return for specific changes in working practices,
including relaxation of job demarcations, reductions in overtime, and
greater freedom for management to schedule work. The Fawley agree-
ments attracted considerable attention in employer circles and became
widely known through the writings of Allan Flanders.[61] Other employers
followed in the mid-1960s, led initially by American companies or British
firms in capital-intensive industries, such as Mobil Oil, ICI, British
Oxygen, Shell Chemicals, in which firms the need for high and continuous
throughput was of vital importance. By the end of 1966, 73 major

Industrial relations: challenges and responses 139

productivity deals had been signed and up to half a million workers were
affected by productivity bargaining.[62] The agreements differred in scale
and scope, but essentially were attempts, internally within the firm, to
trade off wage increases, higher than would have been possible at national
level, for certain specific changes in working practices at plant level.
These changes included such things as reductions in overtime working,
reduced manning levels, increases in flexibility between workers, and the
use of work-study techniques often associated with the rationalisation
of pay structures.[63] In these deals management tended to take the initiative
and usually attempted to bargain with the unions as a group. The
agreements differed from earlier bargaining in that they were more
far-reaching, more formal, and attempted more explicitly to link wages
and working practices. From the mid-1960s, the Labour government
encouraged this kind of bargaining as a means of containing inflationary
wage pressures. This further encouraged the spread of productivity bar-
gaining: by the end of 1969 the Department of Employment and Produc-
tivity registered some 3,000 agreements covering nearly six million work-
ers or 25 per cent of the labour force. Though some of these later deals
were merely a way around government incomes policy and, for a time,
discredited productivity agreements, nevertheless during these years
internal plant bargaining was given a considerable impetus.[64]

In 1968 the Royal Commission on Trade Unions and Employers'
Associations (the Donovan Commission), which had been established
in 1965 to examine Britain's industrial relations problems, reported.[65]

Briefly, the Commission concluded that key sectors of British industry
and many leading firms had serious industrial relations problems. These
it attributed to deficiencies in the collective bargaining institutions, in
particular the gap between the pretence of the national arrangements on
the one hand and the reality of workplace bargaining on the other. In a
much quoted paragraph it concluded:

Britain has two systems of industrial relations. One is the formal system
embodied in the official institutions. The other is the informal system created
by the actual behaviour of trade unions and employers' associations, of
managers, shop stewards and workers... The informal system is often at odds
with the formal system.[66]

More particularly it argued that wage drift, unofficial strikes, and restric-
tive practices were the result of the inadequate conduct of industrial
relations at company and plant level. They will persist', it argued, 'as
long as companies pay inadequate attention to their pay structures and
personnel policies and the methods of negotiating adopted in the work-
place remain in their present chaotic state.' Moreover, it argued, They
will continue until the confusion which so often surrounds the exercise


-----

by management of its "rights" has been resolved by the settlement of
clear rules and procedures which are accepted as fair and reasonable by
all concerned.'[67]

The Report was especially critical of management, arguing that many
companies had 'no effective personnel policy to control methods of
negotiation and pay structures, and perhaps no conception of one'.[68]

Problems would persist, it suggested, as long as firms did not plan their
personnel policies and allowed workplace industrial relations to remain
outside the control of the management hierarchy. It argued that the
primary responsibility for change lay with managers and it looked
especially to boards of directors of large companies to take the initiative.[69]

More specifically it recommended that they should seek 'comprehensive
and authoritative' agreements within the firm, including the establishment
of effective negotiating and disputes procedures, written agreements, and
new wage systems and structures.[70] This would be based on negotiations
with unions and fuller acceptance of the role of shop stewards and would
mean an internalisation of industrial relations.[71]

The Donovan report was criticised at the time for various reasons.
Many employers felt it placed too much blame on management and
underestimated the role unions and shop stewards had played in creating
problems.[72] Employers' organisations felt it underestimated the import-
ance of national agreements and that the recommendation for decentrali-
sation of bargaining threatened leapfrogging. However, in the context of
the time, the Report was a remarkably powerful document both in terms
of its analysis and its prescriptions. In historical perspective, perhaps
the main reservation about the Report is that its actual impact has been
exaggerated. Firms and employers' associations were already beginning
to act in the way Donovan prescribed - and indeed Donovan recognised
this.[73] It seems likely that other firms would have followed even without
the report. Donovan and other government interventions in the 1960s
and 1970s played an important role in educating and encouraging, but
the main instigators in reshaping the system of industrial relations were
employers.

**The further progress of change**

From the mid-1960s, as British firms were attempting to reform their
overall organisational structures (as described in Chapter 6), they were
also trying to sort out their industrial relations problems. Indeed there
was a significant connection between overall organisational change and
industrial relations. The merger movement of the 1960s may for a time

Industrial relations: challenges and responses 141

have accentuated some of the labour problems, for example by complicat-
ing bargaining arrangements and generating parity claims between plants.
However, the subsequent restructuring of firms, often on multidivisional
lines, and the development of managerial hierarchies provided firms with
a better organisational capability to act. Such reorganisation simul-
taneously facilitated the setting of strategic goals and imposed more
effective control over lower management.[74] Better organised firms had
more of a choice to locate bargaining at the level which suited them best.
The development of managerial hierarchies, especially the growth in the
number and professionalism of personnel specialists, facilitated the plan-
ning and coordination of industrial relations strategies.[75]

Many firms undergoing reorganisation on these lines in the 1960s and
1970s felt less need for employer organisation membership, since they
were increasingly able to provide their own services internally.[76] For
them employers' organisations no longer performed any real protective
function. In fact, as we have shown, for many, membership could be
harmful. It exposed them to national claims while at the same time
restricting the development of their own domestic policies. Diversified
firms, which might be members of two or more separate associations,
found it difficult or meaningless to reconcile the different national agree-
ments to which they were parties. A number of large firms therefore left
their employers' associations. Some, such as Ford and ICI, had never
been members or had left many years previously. Others, for example,
Esso, Shell, BP, and Alcan, left their associations or loosened their ties
in the mid-1960s. By the time of Donovan others were expressing doubts.
In evidence to the Royal Commission, the International Publishing
Corporation stated that the value of its membership of the British Feder-
ation of Master Printers was 'very slight indeed';[77] the electrical company,
Philips, stated, 'It is our view that the Engineering Employers' Federation
is far too large and ponderous to continue filling what was once a
constructive role';[78] and Cadburys resigned from its employers' bargain-
ing body 'primarily because of the rigidity of the national wage system
under which flat wage awards are given without recognition of local
needs'.[79] There was a similar trend in the engineering industry, where,
finally, after a national strike in 1979, in which many companies felt
unnecessarily involved, the two largest firms in the industry, GEC and
British Leyland, withdrew from membership.[80]

Thus national bargaining became less important and national wage
agreements became more like safety nets, with decreasing relevance to
companies. Some agreements, as in rubber and parts of the food-
processing industry, collapsed altogether. In the case of national pro-
cedural agreements, a significant event occurred in 1971 when the


-----

142 Challenges and adjustments

engineering unions terminated the historic engineering industry pro-
cedure. The unions had objected to various aspects, especially the
managerial prerogatives clause and management's claimed priority of
interpretation. When agreement could not be reached on a new status
_quo clause, they therefore gave notice to terminate the procedure and_
the large firms in the industry did nothing to save it.[81] However, it should
be stressed that not all employers' organisations declined in membership
or importance. Some large firms remained in membership, though usually
in order to obtain advisory and lobbying services rather than for collective
bargaining purposes. Many medium-sized and small firms continued to
rely on their associations and on national agreements and, for them,
there was some justification in terms of administrative economies and
protection against trade unions.[82] In some industries, such as parts of
printing, building, textiles, footwear, and clothing, employers' organisa-
tions remained relatively more important. These tended to be industries
dominated by smaller firms which failed to develop internal organisa-
tional capabilities and for which national collective bargaining still pro-
vided some real benefits in terms of controlling competition based on
wage-cutting.
The aim of many large firms through the 1970s was to relocate and
formalise collective bargaining. This meant bargaining somewhere below
the level of the industry but above the level of the shopfloor. The intention
then was to internalise industrial relations and reduce the number of
bargaining points thereby tailoring agreements to the firm's needs and
strengthening management's position. There were important differences
between firms as to the degree of centralisation and the level of collective
bargaining. In some firms, for example, ICI, Ford, Kodak, and the British
Sugar Corporation, collective bargaining was highly centralised covering
all or most of the firm's activities. These tended to be firms with relatively
standardised products, integrated production systems, and centralised,
functional forms of organisation. Other firms, such as British Leyland,
moved in this direction in the late 1970s. On the other hand, some firms,
such as Pilkingtons, Lucas, Philips and Cadburys, began to decentralise
their bargaining arrangements. Some diversified companies, such as
Unilever, Imperial Group, and Reed International, usually with clear
product market categories and multidivisional structures, have chosen
to bargain at divisional level for many of their activities. Many firms,
where production units were not particularly integrated and where there
was more plant autonomy, chose to bargain primarily at plant level. This
included firms such as GEC and GKN in engineering and Courtaulds
and Coats Vyella in textiles.[83] These differences in bargaining levels in
large part reflected differences in corporate structure and showed the


-----

growing capability of managements to make new strategic choices in
industrial relations.
In the circumstances of the 1970s, when trade union power remained
strong, employers saw the need to introduce these changes through
collective bargaining with unions. In fact, increasingly they preferred to
deal with shop stewards internally within the firm rather than with
full-time union officers.[84] The number of stewards rose from roughly
175,000 in the mid-1960s to about 300,000 by the late 1970s. At the same
time firms tried to deal with more organised and formal joint shop
stewards' committees led by senior stewards and convenors. This was
reflected in the facilities which were afforded shop stewards and the
growing number recognised as full-time by management which rose in
manufacturing from about 1,000 at the time of Donovan to about 5,000
in the late 1970s.[85] In some instances where workplace organisation was
less developed, management even took the initiative in order to mould
it more effectively from the start.[86]

In the 1970s managements were also prepared to go further in providing
union security. There were potential problems for management in going
so far as to recognise the closed shop: it reduced management flexibility
in recruitment and threatened to increase union strength. On the other
hand, it offered the prospects of stability and discipline. In calculating
the costs and benefits, an increasing number of managers felt it was best
to concede the closed shop. The number of workers covered by such
arrangements rose from about one in six in the early 1960s to about one
in four by 1978, and the closed shop spread beyond traditional sectors
into chemicals, oil refining, and food and drink. In manufacturing
industry as a whole about half the union members were covered by closed
shop arrangements which also tended to be more formal and more
explicitly supported by management than previously.[87] In addition, by
the late 1970s in three quarters of workforces where manual unions were
recognised employers had agreed to collect union dues through check-off
arrangements.[88] Together these developments (the growth in the number
and power of shop stewards, management's preference for dealing with
them rather than full-time officers, and the development of joint shop
steward committees) may be seen as the growth of a form of unionism
internal to the firm.[89]

Firms also made progress in tackling problems of internal wage struc-
tures and payment systems. From the mid-1960s, there was a movement
away from piecework and towards measured daywork schemes - payment
by time dependent on the achievement of work-studied output targets.[90]

(This and the diffusion of work study techniques were also part of the
continuing, though not always successful, effort to deal with restrictive


-----

144 Challenges and adjustments

work rules.[91]) In addition, through the 1970s, there was a significant
increase in job evaluation for blue-collar workers. This will be examined
in more detail in the next chapter. It is sufficient to state here that both
measured daywork and job evaluation favoured plant-wide bargaining
and involved the reform of internal wage structures.[92]

Inevitably the process of change was not without its problems for
management and led to some opposition from the workforce. The
extension and formalisation of collective bargaining, though intended to
enhance management control, simultaneously increased the number and
power of shop stewards.[93] As the scope of collective bargaining expanded,
so the area of managerial prerogatives was challenged. Given the strength
and self-assurance of the shopfloor, much informality remained and new
customs and practices were created. In some situations, after management
had bought out restrictive work rules in productivity-type bargaining,
they were unable to prevent the creation of new ones.[94] The number of
strikes, outside coal mining, rose to 2,930 in 1969 and to 3,746 in 1970.
Subsequently the number of working days lost in strikes fluctuated, with
high points in 1972, 1974, and 1979.[95] However, a growing proportion
occurred in the public sector where they were often a direct or indirect
response to government intervention in the form of incomes policies. In
the private sector strikes became bigger and longer, in terms of the
number of workers involved and the working days lost through each
strike, and the small, sectional, unofficial strike fell in relative frequency.[96]

This reflected the impact of managerial reform strategies, the move to
company- and plant-wide bargaining, and the reform of payment systems.
The growth of white-collar unionism was an issue with which employers
had to contend in the 1970s. In some firms union membership for white
collar workers had existed for many years; in other firms it was an entirely
new phenomenon. The density of private-sector white-collar unionism
rose from 12 per cent in 1968 to 27 per cent in 1973 and continued to
increase thereafter up to 1979 but at a slower rate.[97] In the face of this,
employers' traditional opposition to the unionisation of white-collar staff
diminished in the course of the 1970s. Attempts to compete with unions
via staff associations continued, though a growing number of firms felt
it best to recognise the orthodox unions in order to forestall any further
problems.[98] Overall employers established better bargaining arrange-
ments and procedures and more effective salary structures with greater
use of incremental pay increases than had been the case with blue-collar
workers. On the other hand, difficulties did arise. Multiunionism was a
problem for some employers and strike activity increased among white-
collar workers. Perhaps more important, given the continued weakness
of managerial hierarchies in Britain, union organisation spread further

up the supervisory and managerial structure than many employers
thought desirable."
Through the 1970s, governments offered support with reform, but also
created industrial relations problems for employers. In the area of trade
union law, the Conservative government's 1971 Industrial Relations Act,
with its provision for legally binding agreements, machinery to deal with
multiunionism and procedural problems, and legal protection against a
number of unfair industrial practices, was designed to be of use to
employers. However, most employers were extremely reluctant to use
the law. Clearly, the strength of union opposition to the Act was an
important factor, but employers also calculated that in the circumstances
of the time it was best to rely on their own strategies for reform rather
than have recourse to the law. For example, the Act introduced severe
restrictions on the operation of the closed shop, but jointly managements
and unions evaded them and the closed shop continued to operate.[100]

In the late 1970s, the threat of a legal imposition of worker directors at
the time of the Bullock Commission of Enquiry on Industrial Democracy
was resisted by employers who feared that the trade union channel of
worker representation would excessively strengthen union power and
extend bargaining into major corporate decisions.[101] The report and the
possibility of EEC-inspired legislation, however, made managements
realise that some action was required.[102] As a result, some tried to build
on existing schemes, while others introduced new consultative arrange-
ments, both often alongside collective bargaining. By the late 1970s more
than 40 per cent of manufacturing plants had some sort of consultative
arrangements, most introduced during the course of the 1970s.[103] These
were necessarily always internal to the firm, organised at plant level as
in BP or based on a more complex, hierarchical system as at Cadbury-
Schweppes and British Leyland.[104]

Government intervention in the form of the Donovan and Bullock
reports, new labour legislation, and the activities of agencies such as the
Commission on Industrial Relations and, later, the Advisory Conciliation
and Arbitration Service played an important part in the changes of the
1960s and 1970s. Such intervention raised employers' awareness, stimu-
lated action, and encouraged the formalisation of rules and procedures.
Overall, however, as the Donovan Commission itself prescribed,
employers took the initiative in developing industrial relations internally
within their companies. This they did slowly and uncertainly, impelled
by economic factors and the need to tighten control. A number of large
firms led the way, some with good industrial relations such as ICI or
BP, others impelled by pressing problems such as British Leyland and
other engineering companies. The move to single-employer bargaining,


-----

146 Challenges and adjustments

with plant, divisional or corporate agreements and more formality, was
significantly related to larger plant and company size.[105] Also, foreign
multinationals played an important part. In the late 1970s about a quarter
of the 4,000 largest private companies in Great Britain were foreign
owned and in manufacturing around one in five jobs were in such firms.[106]

These were often leaders in terms of the employment of personnel
specialists, the move to single-employer bargaining, the development of
more formal agreements, and the use of new forms of payment system.[107]

As a postscript, the 1980s have seen important changes, but also
considerable continuity in industrial relations. In the changed economic,
political, and legal climate, trade union membership fell by three million,
legislative changes have considerably restrained union activities, and the
number of strikes declined. At workplace level the closed shop has been
curtailed and shop steward influence reduced. In these circumstances,
management seized the opportunity to push through changes in industrial
relations practices which resulted in major defeats for unions in sectors
such as motor vehicles, steel, coal mining, printing, and shipping. Less
dramatic, but more important, employers have enforced concessionary
agreements allowing changes in working practices and have sought to
reduce collective bargaining as a constraint on their activities. In parallel
they have increased the scope of unilateral management action and have
extended non-union-based consultation and participation systems.
However, there have also been significant continuities with the 1960s
and 1970s. There have been relatively few cases of the derecognition of
unions and collective bargaining still remains the main form of joint
rule-making in industrial relations. Despite a growing formality of indus-
trial relations, in line with long traditions of informality in Britain, shop
stewards have retained a degree of influence as evidenced by the price
in terms of wage increases which employers have had to pay for change.[108]

The trend towards internal, single-employer bargaining has continued,
often with a further decentralisation to plant rather than company or
divisional level.[109] There has also been a continuing trend towards the
insulation of bargaining from outside forces, with pay and conditions
more related to inside forces such as productivity and profitability. Thus,
many of the changes of the 1980s have been built on the developments
of the two previous decades.

**Conclusions**

By the late 1970s a new industrial relations system had emerged in Great
Britain. Internal single-employer bargaining had largely superseded
external or national bargaining in importance. In manufacturing industry,


-----

Industrial relations: challenges and responses 147

in plants employing 50 or more workers, single-employer bargaining was
the main method whereby wages and conditions were determined for
two thirds of manual workers. Multi-employer bargaining, on the other
hand, which before and immediately after the Second World War was
a major source of wages and conditions in most industries, remained so
for only a quarter of manual workers. In the case of non-manual
employees, for whom multi-employer bargaining had never been so
important, three quarters had their wages and conditions determined
mainly at company or plant level.[110] In parallel with this, informal and
fragmented shopfloor bargaining had also been much reduced and agree-
ments tended to be more comprehensive, covering the whole of a plant
or a number of plants in a company. Along with this, personnel manage-
ment had become more professional, procedures and agreements more
elaborate and formal, and wage systems and work standards more tightly
defined and related to internal company criteria.
Management's overall structures and bargaining preferences in par-
ticular market contexts have been the key determinants of the structure
of collective bargaining. Multi-employer bargaining was initially the
product of small firms or loosely co-ordinated larger firms, often in
situations where product markets were administered or protected and
where labour markets were loose. The development of fragmented shop-
floor bargaining in the post-Second World War period coincided with
weak holding-company type firms and weak managerial hierarchies in a
context of growing product market competition and full employment in
the labour market. The emergence of more formal single-employer bar-
gaining is based on more centralised and better coordinated companies
which have attempted to control their industrial relations and improve
efficiency to meet the challenge of more competitive markets. Over the
period of a quarter century, British firms have, largely in response to
market forces and the need to regain control, sought to internalise their
industrial relations within the firm.

### 8 Employment relations in the post-war period

In the area of employment relations the pattern delineated in earlier
chapters may be summarised as follows. From the nineteenth century
onwards British employers relied to a large extent on market mechanisms
and externalised their employee relations; they hired and fired as demand
dictated; they provided minimal training; and wages were related in
various ways to market criteria, such as the 'going rate' for labour or the
selling price of the product. The attachment of the worker to the employer
was limited and internal employment systems were rudimentary. In some
firms this pattern was tempered by vestiges of traditional paternalism of
an ad hoc, personal nature. However, this was of decreasing applicability
to the large, multi-plant enterprise which emerged during the course of
the twentieth century. Yet in only a few such large firms had more
complex internal employment systems developed by the end of the
interwar period.
In the post-Second World War years, economists have identified and
analysed so-called internal labour markets.[1] By this, they mean that
employment systems can exist within firms which are relatively insulated
from the external market and are regulated by a complex set of internal
administrative rules and procedures. Thus firms hire workers into a
limited number of entry jobs and then rely upon training and promotion
to fill the majority of higher level jobs. To this end, jobs within the firm
are ordered into something like a promotional hierarchy and, in compet-
ing for these jobs, employees are not subject to strong competition from
workers outside the firm. In addition, the firm tries to avoid redundancies
and attempts to maintain employment stability for key workers and
disciplinary codes and procedures prevent arbitrary dismissal by super-
visors. Pay is decided by internal administrative criteria, such as seniority
and merit as adjudged by management, and more extensive non-wage
benefits are provided. As a consequence of these arrangements, the
attachment between the employer and the worker is more complex and
longer term.

Various reasons have been suggested in the literature for the growth
of internal labour markets or this form of modern, bureaucratic paternal-
ism. First, technology and training are cited as important causal factors.
Over time, it is argued, production processes and procedures have become
more firm-specific and employers have to train workers accordingly.
Because of the investment in firm-specific training, it makes sense for
employers to hold on to their labour force and for workers to stay in
their jobs. To achieve this, the firm offers its workers greater job security,
the prospect of advancement, good wages, and fringe benefits. This, it
is argued, is more likely to occur in parts of the economy where demand
is particularly stable.[2] A second explanation stresses the need for manage-
ments in large firms to control or motivate mass work forces. Radical
economists have argued that employers seek to control their labour force
by segmenting it into hierarchical categories, by offering the carrot of
promotion, and by providing an array of benefits which tie the worker
to the firm.[3] More neo-classical economists have suggested that employers
can better motivate and monitor their labour force when they offer greater
job security, internal promotion, and hierarchical wage and benefit scales
which reward employees according to seniority and contribution rather
than market forces.[4] In either case, big firms are leaders in this respect
because they have both a greater incentive and ability to set up internal
labour market arrangements.[5] A third explanation places the emphasis
as much or more on workers and their unions. Workers, it is argued,
dislike instability and uncertainty: they therefore have good reason to
support the development of internal institutional mechanisms for con-
trolling competition, allocating jobs, and rewarding seniority. Through
their unions, they press for such arrangements and defend them once
established. A variant of this argument is that indirectly the threat of
unions forces employers to set up internal labour markets either to keep
unions out or contain them once organised.[6] Of course, there are other
possible explanations for such arrangements. For example, it could be
argued that the state has been a major force, both in terms of providing
the example of secure employment in the public sector and by means of
legislation setting employment standards.
This chapter explores some of these issues. It argues that, in the period
since the Second World War, there have been significant changes in the
employment relationship and a faster growth of internal labour markets
in Britain. However, there have also been considerable continuities with
Britain's past and with policies and practices of externalisation. The
following sections deal with patterns of employment and job tenure;
recruitment, promotion, and termination of employment; training; and
wages and other benefits.

**Patterns of employment and job tenure**

The background story of the labour market since 1945 can be divided
roughly into two parts, the transition point between the two being in the
early 1970s. Unemployment averaged 1.7 per cent during the 1950s and
2 per cent during the 1960s. The strong demand for labour during this
period was the result of a slowdown in the growth of the workforce and
a more stable demand for labour from firms. At each cyclical peak there
were shortages of labour, especially skilled labour. Though the overall
trend of unemployment was slowly upwards, this was not particularly
pronounced until the early 1970s. Unemployment then rose, passing the
1 million level or 4.3 per cent of the insured working population by 1975
and 3 million or 13.3 per cent by 1982. Thus, the first quarter century
after the Second World War was one of unprecedented full employment
and high labour demand; after a transition period, this was followed by
unemployment which in the early 1980s approximated interwar levels.[7]

In the first period employers were keen to hold on to labour; in the
second period workers were keen to hold on to jobs.
In the 1950s and 1960s, full employment and shortages of skilled
workers led employers to hoard labour. In the past there had been a
tendency for firms to hold on to a nucleus of core workers through
recessions. However, in the context of the post-war economic cycle, this
became more pronounced. Employers had a greater incentive to hoard
given the expectation of upturn and consequent labour shortages. Such
labour hoarding can be roughly gauged by the way, during downturns,
the percentage reduction in employment was always significantly less
than the percentage fall in output.[8] Various explanations for such
behaviour have been offered. Some have argued that technological factors
and the inflexible way in which production came to be organised meant
that firms needed a certain complement of labour in order to run a plant.[9]

Others have stressed the costs of hiring and training skilled workers,
pointing out that such employees, with associated higher fixed costs of
hiring and training, have shown less variation in unemployment over the
cycle than unskilled workers.[10] Undoubtedly, in historical terms, labour
hoarding and the stability of employment in the early post-war period
were influenced by full employment and economic confidence. It has
only been from the early 1970s onwards, as the experience of recession
has deepened and lengthened, that firms have more readily adjusted their
employment relative to output.
On the employees' side, turnover rose rapidly immediately after the
war as wartime restrictions on mobility were eased and people began to
move out of munitions and back into their old jobs. In the early 1950s


-----

Employment relations in the post-war period 151

turnover rates fell somewhat while still remaining high through the
1950s.[11] As after the First World War, there was an increased managerial
interest in turnover and a huge literature developed on its causes and
costs.[12] The realisation grew that, since turnover varied greatly between
firms in the same industry and locality, it could not be explained solely
by external economic factors, but was partly affected by internal institu-
tional arrangements. Commentators at this time started to write about
policies and practices which firms could adopt to increase retention.[13]

As one engineering manager commented, the need was to develop
arrangements 'to build up a positive loyalty'. He went on:
Such a process takes time, and many experiments must be tried in the course
of it. Pension schemes, long-service awards, a clear statement of promotion
prospects, careful explanation of wage rates, possibly profit sharing, will have
an effect in offsetting the natural tendency to rush off to where a few shillings
more a week are being offered, by the confidence in a more solid and secure
reward for faithful service.[14]
Writing about policies to reduce turnover one study concluded, The true
cost of these schemes is not the total outlay on them but this outlay less
the savings resulting from the lower turnover.'[15] The costs which were
usually identified were the costs of hiring and training, lower productivity
of new workers, and the higher costs of supervising a rapidly changing
labour force. A later British Institute of Management study put this more
positively: 'Surely the main objective of all welfare schemes, pension
plans, social clubs and the like is something far more positive than merely
to prevent employees leaving the company. They could be said to be
undertaken to raise morale and increase productivity.'[16]

Official figures show that hiring and leaving rates in manufacturing
industry per month averaged 2.9 per cent and 2.7 per cent respectively
through the 1950s and 2.7 per cent and 2.7 per cent through the 1960s.
From the late 1960s onwards, the turnover rate declined: it fell from 2.2
per cent and 2.4 per cent respectively in the 1970s to 1.4 per cent and
1.7 per cent in the early 1980s.[17] Though there is a clear inverse relation-
ship between the level of business activity and labour turnover, other
studies have also shown a variation between and within industries in the
levels of turnover. Industries with low labour turnover have been
chemicals, oil refining, and other industries dominated by large firms
with more firm-specific production technologies and more sophisticated
internal labour policies; those with high labour turnover have been
construction, textiles, and clothing.[18] Within the same industry and the
same locality turnover has been observed to vary considerably between
firms, in large part reflecting size, capital intensity, and the adoption of
internal labour market type arrangements.[19]

From the late 1960s, as rising unemployment and restricted job oppor-
tunities have reduced turnover, the proportion of long-tenured workers
has risen in most industries. The existence of a 'core' of long-service
employees and a periphery of 'floaters' has long been noted.[20] One study
estimated that, for full-time adult males in 1968, 44 per cent of jobs
lasted for 20 years or more and 69 per cent for 10 years or more. However,
there were significant differences between industries. For example, in the
private sector, 55 per cent of the jobs in chemicals were estimated to last
for 20 or more years, whereas the percentage for textiles and construction
were 35 and 22 per cent respectively. Not surprisingly, white collar sectors
such as banking and finance had the highest proportion of long-lasting
jobs at 71 per cent.[21] Unfortunately, there is no statistical series to prove
that jobs have become longer-lasting over time, but various pieces of
research do support the proposition that the proportion of long-tenured
workers has been increasing in most industries and that average job
tenures are longer than in the US, about the same as in France and
Germany, but shorter than in Japan.[22]

A number of factors may be adduced to explain the changing pattern
of employment stability, labour turnover, and job tenure. Macroeconomic
factors have been important, especially the demand for labour and the
level of unemployment. Technological change and increasing capital
intensity may also in part explain higher levels of labour stability and
retention. However, they alone cannot explain variations, especially
within industries. Other factors of an institutional nature must be
included, such as changes in employment practices, training, pay struc-
tures, and fringe benefits between industries and between firms. Each of
these will be examined in turn in the following sections.

**Recruitment and job tenure**

Since the Second World War, selection procedures for manual workers
have slowly become more sophisticated and formalised, especially in
larger firms. Immediately after the war, in part as a consequence of
wartime military selection practices, there was an increased use of tests
and more extensive interviewing.[23] With the growth of personnel depart-
ments, recruitment became more centralised and fewer firms allowed
foremen freedom to hire. Of course, 'word of mouth' and other ad hoc
recruitment practices continued, but overall the trend was towards cen-
tralisation and systematisation. In the period of tight labour markets and
labour shortages in the 1950s and 1960s, the cost of hiring was high
and many better-managed firms increasingly realised that they had


-----

Employment relations in the post-war period 153

to pay great attention to recruitment and induction in order to reduce
turnover.[24]

In the area of termination of employment, a distinction must be drawn
between redundancy and disciplinary dismissals. In both areas British
employers had traditionally claimed the right to lay off and dismiss at
will. During the Second World War, however, the freedom of employers
to discharge an employee from a scheduled employment was restricted
(as was an employee's freedom to leave an establishment). After the war,
there was a slow but steady growth of procedures and formal rules in
this area. The practice of giving notice or making a payment in lieu
became more widespread. In the case of redundancy, before the war a
few exceptional firms had instituted policies of advance notice and
severance payments. After the war these became more widespread in
large public- and private-sector organisations and, in the 1950s, the
practice of 'last in, first out' became better established when reductions
in the labour force were necessary.[25] For example, in the motor industry,
particularly subject to employment instability, a strike in 1956 against
British Motor Corporation's dismissal of 6,000 workers without notice
forced management to agree to pay compensation and to accept the 'last
in, first out' formula.[26] In the case of disciplinary dismissals, there was
also a development of procedures. Increasingly, line managers and fore-
men were no longer allowed summarily to dismiss workers without
reference to higher management and the personnel department, and this
necessitated going through a procedure.[27] The reasons for these changes
were complex. Government exhortation and trade union pressures were
important. However, in the British voluntaristic tradition, there was no
legislation in this area until the early 1970s; and trade unions were
ambivalent about formal agreements and procedures on such matters.
Much of the initial impetus came from firms which saw personnel
advantages in introducing rules and procedures, not least that these
offered greater security for employees and thereby improved morale and
labour stability.[28]

It is true that through the 1960s the law had an important effect. Three
main pieces of legislation must be noted. The Contracts of Employment
Act 1963 obliged employers to provide a written statement of the principal
terms and conditions of employment, thus ending the informality of
purely oral contracts, and it gave employees a right to a minimum period
of notice according to length of service.[29] The Redundancy Payments
Act 1965 compelled employers to make a payment, based on earnings
and length of service, to employees declared redundant after a certain
qualifying period of employment.[30] Later amendments obliged employers
to give notice of redundancy on a sliding-scale basis according to the


-----

154 Challenges and adjustments

numbers involved. The Industrial Relations Act 1971 introduced legal
standards and procedures for disciplinary dismissals. It also gave
employees the right, depending on a minimum qualifying period, to
appeal to an industrial tribunal, where compensation for unfair dismissal
could be awarded based on length of service, and from 1976 onwards
employees have had the legally enforceable possibility of re-employ-
ment.[31]

Legislation on unfair dismissal and redundancy payments had different
objectives. The aim of the former was to prevent arbitrary dismissal and
to improve job security. The aim of the latter was to give compensation
for loss of job security and overall it has probably made workers more
willing to accept redundancy. However, to put compulsory redundancy
into perspective, it must be stated that this constitutes only a small
proportion of total terminations and redundancy is usually the last resort
of employers wishing to make reductions in their labour force.[32] When
there is a lack of work, employers have increasingly sought to make
various adjustments short of redundancy. The practice is usually to cease
hiring, reduce overtime, redeploy workers, and to call for early retirement
and voluntary redundancies in the hope that natural wastage will
sufficiently reduce the labour force. The aim of the legislation on unfair
dismissal has been to increase job security and this it has probably
accomplished. In 1969 13 per cent of plants employing between 100 and
500 workers sacked more than 6 per cent of their workforce (excluding
redundancies); by 1977 the proportion of managers sacking more than
3.5 per cent of their workers had been reduced to 5 per cent.[33] The law
has also had a considerable impact on disciplinary procedures: as late
as 1969 only 8 per cent of plants had a written disciplinary procedure,
whereas by the early 1980s this had risen to over 80 per cent.[34]

Of course employment protection legislation has not created real job
property rights. The employer still has the ultimate right to lay off or
dismiss; most compensation payments are relatively low; and only a
small minority of successful claimants in unfair dismissal cases win
re-employment.[35] Overall, the main impact of these laws has been to
increase formalisation in terms of written statements and procedures; to
make it more expensive to hire and fire workers; and therefore to make
firms pay greater attention to the quality of labour they recruit.[36] In these
areas the law has given some procedural protection to workers, especially
in smaller firms and non-union situations. However, it must be stressed
that many of the larger firms were moving in these directions anyway
and tended to offer provisions above the statutory base-line.[37]

Traditionally, employers also resorted to temporary lay-offs and short-
time working, both in old industries such as textiles and newer industries


-----

Employment relations in the post-war period 155

such as motor vehicles. During the boom years after the Second World
War, short-time was used much less than in previous decades in large
part because of the greater stability of demand and full employment in
the post-war period. A contributory factor may also have been that it
became more difficult after the war to use the state unemployment benefit
system to support short-time and lay-offs. However, another reason was
the growth after the war of guaranteed week arrangements, often negoti-
ated between employers and trade unions. These had their origins in the
wartime Essential Work Orders which guaranteed wages if employees
were available for work and willing to perform reasonable alternative
work.[38] Bevin advocated such agreements to unions at the end of the
war:

Does anybody ... want to go back to the hourly payment? I cannot believe it.
This standing on and off, this going to the factory door in the morning, and
'Nothing doing, Tom, go home' - surely nobody ever wants to go back to that
**39**
again.
Guaranteed week agreements have assured workers a proportion of their
pay for a specified number of days of short-time or lay-off. The guarantees
are usually subject to various qualifications, especially a suspension of
the obligation to pay if the lack of work is due to strike action in the
firm. Nor do they actually prevent lay-offs and short-time, rather they
regulate it by setting a price on its use. By 1980 nine million out of
thirteen million workers covered by national agreements were entitled
to guaranteed week payments.[40] Over time the provisions have improved
both in terms of the proportion of income guaranteed and the duration
of their payment.[41]

Turning finally to internal recruitment and promotion. For many
manual workers in Britain jobs remained 'dead-end' and promotion
prospects were poor. Firms have been slow to develop systematic methods
of promotion, and selection for promotion tends to be ad hoc.[42] This
contrasted with stronger systems of seniority in countries such as the
US, Germany, and Japan.[43] However, traditionally in Britain there was
always an element of recruitment to higher positions and in a few
industries, such as the railways and steel, promotion ladders were highly
formalised.[44] Even in engineering, where job structures might be thought
to be relatively flat and where craft opposition to the promotion of
semi-skilled workers was traditionally strong, there is evidence of an
employer preference for internal promotion wherever possible.[45] Over
the post-Second World War period promotion systems have, however,
become more structured and formalised, with internal advertising on
plant notice boards, the right to bid for jobs before outsiders, and some
notion of promotion by seniority.[46] In part these developments have


-----

156 Challenges and adjustments

come about because of pressure from workers and their trade unions. In
part it has been the result of economic pressures, since, in periods of
labour shortage, employers will rely more on internal recruitment.
However, the practice has continued to grow during periods of labour
surplus, suggesting that employers have an interest in developing internal
promotion systems.[47]

In conclusion, rules and formal practices have developed on various
aspects of employment status which, when taken together, are evidence
of the growth of stronger internal labour market-type arrangements. In
part these developments were prompted by government legislation and
trade union pressure. More, however, they have resulted from the growing
pursuit by many employers of strategies of internalisation. This has
occurred because, in the post-war period, such firms have had a greater
incentive to adopt these practices and a growing capability to administer
such arrangements. On the whole, however, these have developed more
slowly and are less formalised than in equivalent firms in the USA, Japan,
or Germany, and British employers still retain a greater preference for
the use of external labour market mechanisms.

**Training: limited internalisation and inadequate provision**

There are a number of courses of action employers can take to acquire
and develop a skilled labour force. They may do no training themselves,
but hope to poach labour from other firms and acquire labour from the
market. Alternatively, they can provide training for their own workers
through external institutions such as technical colleges or government
training schemes. Or they can organise their own training internally
within the firm, either on-the-job or off-the-job in a special training
department, and they may supplement this with day release. Internal
training is more likely to be firm-specific and, from an employer's point
of view, it is arguable that such training is more efficient and effective:[48]

it can be geared to the firm's needs; it can draw on internal specialists
and use company plant and equipment; and workers trained in this way
may be more attached to the firm since their skills are more closely bound
up with it.[49]

As we have seen in earlier chapters, British managements were not
particularly well trained themselves and in part because of this they did
not value the training of those below them. In addition, because of the
availability of labour, including skilled labour on the external market,
British employers failed to develop strong internal training arrangements.
The main formal method of training in Britain had always been the craft


-----

Employment relations in the post-war period 157

apprenticeship. This was served within the firm, but was always intended
to provide a significant proportion of training in all-round skills general
to a trade. However, it also involved a firm-specific element which may
have increased during the interwar years when employers increasingly
misused the apprenticeship system as a form of cheap labour. After the
Second World War, apprenticeship was increasingly combined with some
form of day-release for attendance at classes in a technical college and
this may have enhanced the proportion of general skills.[50] On the other
hand, the diffusion of firm-specific technologies and the increased costs
of training resulting from higher apprentice wage rates, may have led to
an increase in the proportion of firm-specific skills.
In the post-war period the apprenticeship system was subject to grow-
ing criticism. Experience during the Second World War had shown that
it was possible to train a labour force more effectively and in a shorter
time than had previously been thought possible.[51] The apprenticeship
system was criticised for failing to provide proper training, for restricting
entry into jobs, and for creating a defensive set of attitudes on the part
of workers concerned to protect their investment in traditional skills. As
the Donovan Commission stated, 'the knowledge that they have virtually
committed themselves to a craft for life makes men alert to guard what
they consider to be their own preserve and to oppose relaxations in
practices which, however desirable and even essential for efficiency, may
seem to constitute a threat to their whole way of life'.[52] Thus, in Britain,
through the post-war period, the apprenticeship system remained highly
resistant to change and was neither modernised as in countries such as
Germany and France nor replaced with other forms of in-house training
as in Japan and the US.
However, there were some exceptions and some large firms were
famous for the training which they provided for both apprentice and
non-apprentice labour. Examples were English Electric, Metropolitan
Vickers and AEI in electrical engineering; Rolls Royce and Babcock &
Wilcox in the manufacture of engines and turbines; Stewart & Lloyds
and Richard Thomas & Baldwin in steel; and ICI, Courtaulds, and
Dunlop in their engineering workshops. But such firms were in a minority:
a survey in the mid-1950s cited only 200 firms with systematic training
programmes of a good standard.[53] As a result, in the late 1950s and early
1960s there was a continuing criticism of training in Britain and, in
particular, of the inability to overcome shortages of skilled labour.[54]

In response to such criticisms, in 1964 the government introduced the
Industrial Training Act. This instituted a levy-grant system whereby firms
paid a percentage of payroll into a fund and were rebated if they spent
an equivalent amount on approved training. The intention was both to


-----

158 Challenges and adjustments

encourage training and to spread the costs. For the main sectors of the
economy, industrial training boards were established to administer the
system and to promote training. Overall, the legislation probably had a
small positive effect on the quantity and a larger positive effect on the
quality of training, as an increased number of firms developed training
programmes, established special departments, and appointed training
officers.[55] Though the training boards were organised on industrial lines,
on the whole they probably encouraged a growing element of firm-specific
training, especially in non-apprenticed areas.[56]

Despite the initial positive effect of the industrial training boards, from
the mid-1970s, there was renewed criticism of the training system in
Britain. The anomaly occurred of shortages of skilled labour in a period
of rising and high unemployment.[57] In part this was because, with the
passage of time, the impact of the legislation lost its effect.[58] However,
it was more because, with the advent of recession, British employers cut
back on training expenditures and saw little need to develop new training
arrangements. The number of apprentices declined from the late 1960s
and in the 1980s most of the training boards were abolished by the
Conservative government, which replaced them with a more market-
orientated set of schemes and an emphasis on general transferable
qualifications.[59] This occurred despite a greater awareness of inter-
national comparisons which suggested that Britain's main competitors
did more and better training. Certainly studies show that in West Ger-
many, the USA, and Japan employer-sponsored and employer-organised
training is more extensive than in Britain and foreign firms are more
likely to see training as an investment and not a cost.[60]

Overall, over the post-war period there has been a slow but unsteady
internalisation of training provision in Britain. However, investment in
firm-specific training has, for the most part, been insufficient to encourage
the development of strong internal labour markets intended to deter
turnover and protect investment in training. Similarly, it might be argued
that the slow growth of internal labour markets in Britain and the
attraction of external labour markets explains much of the failure on the
part of British firms to invest in skill formation and to treat training as
an integral part of manpower policies.

**Wage and benefit systems**

The system of wages and benefits is a central aspect of the employment
relationship. Historically, it has been argued in this book that British
employers had a preference for fixing wages according to external market
criteria. Also, increasingly, from the late nineteenth century onwards,


-----

Employment relations in the post-war period 159

they came to rely on piecework as a method of controlling and motivating
workers through short-term incentives. Internal wage structures were
largely unplanned and rudimentary. Similarly, non-wage benefits were
limited and were very unevenly distributed among the labour force.
During the Second World War trends in wages and benefits were some-
what contradictory. On the one hand, external considerations in wage
fixing such as cost-of-living and comparability were strong. There was
also a further extension of piecework, especially in the munitions
industry.[61] On the other hand, there was much greater security in terms
of pay and an extension of benefits in areas such as sick pay, canteens,
and other facilities. After the war, external elements in wage fixing
remained strong, especially with continuing, albeit at first low, levels of
inflation and with the growing assertion of external comparability claims
in plant bargaining. But, in the post-war years, payment by results grew
more slowly. Moreover, increasingly piecework systems had some sort
of fall-back guaranteeing basic rates and the tendency was for the variable
bonus element to be consolidated into an enhanced base rate.[62]

From the mid-1960s, there was a move away from piecework towards
various fixed, time-based systems of payment.[63] Private-sector firms, and
especially larger firms and foreign multinationals, increasingly recognised
the disadvantages associated with piecework, such as restriction of out-
put, constant haggling over rates, and wage drift. Employers also began
to see that piecework was no longer suitable in more automated plants
where the pace of work was largely beyond the control of the worker
and where more stable systems of remuneration might have a more
positive effect on employee relations.[64] Thus in the late 1960s there was
an increase in various forms of fixed day rates such as measured day work,
under which workers were paid a fixed time rate conditional on the
achievement of a performance standard set by work measurement tech-
niques. By the early 1970s, it was estimated that about 10 per cent of
manual workers were covered by measured daywork, with a higher
proportion in larger plants. In the motor industry the proportion covered
was particularly high. Ford, following the practice of its American parent
company, had long used a form of measured daywork; Vauxhall went
over to this system in 1956; Chrysler made the transition in the late 1960s;
and British Leyland followed in the 1970s, though, because of managerial
weaknesses and union strength, this was with considerable difficulties.
Management had various objectives in converting to such systems. One
was to remove some of the disadvantages of piecework by providing
greater stability in earnings while hoping to maintain a high level of
effort. Another important aim was to reduce the number of wage rates
within a plant and to reform internal wage structures.[65]

Of great importance was the growth of job evaluation, especially in
the 1970s. Job evaluation is a set of techniques for analysing and assessing
the content of jobs in order to place them in a hierarchy which can then
be used as the basis for wage structures. Under one popular method,
jobs are analysed in terms of their component factors, for example, skill,
responsibility, effort; points are awarded for each factor according to a
scale; and the total number of points determines a job's place in the
wage hierarchy. Job evaluation had been used in the US in the 1930s
and 1940s, and American firms played an important part in bringing it
to Britain. It was used by a few large British companies from the late
1930s onwards, though mainly for white-collar jobs.[66] However, in the
1960s and 1970s the techniques came to be used to reform blue-collar
wage structures. Between the late 1960s and the late 1970s, the number
of manual workers covered by job evaluation rose from about a quarter
to around a half.[67] Leaders were large firms in such sectors as chemicals,
oil refining, the more modern parts of engineering, and food, drink, and
tobacco. It was also significantly more common among foreign multi-
nationals than British companies.[68] Management's main objective in
introducing job evaluation was to bring order into the wage structure
and to produce a hierarchy of jobs within a plant. In this respect job
evaluation was intended to harness workers' notions of fairness, and
trade union representatives were often involved in the evaluation process.
It was also intended to overcome 'opportunistic' attitudes associated with
piecework and to encourage a 'stable' view of remuneration, thereby
perhaps increasing identification with the firm.[69] There is also some
evidence that job evaluation and other fixed wage systems lead to lower
labour turnover.[70]

In the 1980s employers have experimented with other payment systems.
There has been some interest in plant- and company-wide bonus plans
based on internal performance measures such as value added. These are
intended to introduce an incentive element into pay, while avoiding the
disadvantages of piecework and promoting identification with the firm.[71]

There has been a renewed interest in profit-sharing schemes and, to a
lesser extent, shareownership plans, in part encouraged by government
changes in tax laws. The intention behind such schemes has again been
to introduce an incentive which can be plant- or company-wide and
which may foster employee identification.[72] There has also been an
extension to blue-collar workers of performance-appraisal techniques,
hitherto used mainly for white collar workers. These are either intended
to provide individual merit bonuses or are used to determine progression
up incremental or promotion scales.[73] As of yet, these various pay systems
are still only limited in application and their effects are uncertain.

However, they share two important characteristics: they are an attempt
by management to assert greater control over wage systems and to stress
criteria internal to the firm, such as performance, productivity, and
profitability.
Studies in the 1950s and 1960s had pointed to the chaotic state of
payment systems and wage structures in many British firms, reflecting a
legacy of loose managerial control systems and fragmented bargaining.[74]

By the late 1970s, there had been considerable reform of payment systems
and rationalisation of wage structures. The spread of new time-based
payment systems played a significant part in this trend which was also
facilitated by the development of single-employer bargaining. These
changes have enhanced individual management's control over the wage
structure and have also provided workers with more stability in earnings.
Two further consequences need to be mentioned. One is that wage
structures within firms have tended to become more insulated from
outside pressures. Single-employer bargaining has meant that national
agreements have had a decreasing effect and job evaluation emphasises
internal relativities rather than external comparabilities.[75] There is some
evidence that the level and rate of increase of an individual's pay is now
related less to external factors such as the 'going rate' for a particular
occupation in the external market and more to internal factors within
the firm, such as job structure, seniority, and corporate performance.[76]

A second, and related, consequence may have been to create something
more like formal job hierarchies within British firms. Of course, job
hierarchies always existed, but they had historically tended to be ad hoc
and less under management control. With the introduction of job evalu-
ation and other techniques, management is in a better position to plan
a job hierarchy. Though incremental scales for manual workers are rare,
and though promotion ladders are short, there is some evidence that
wages rise with seniority in Britain, more than might previously have
been thought to be the case.[77]

Non-wage benefits also constitute an important aspect of the employ-
ment relationship and, here also, there have been significant changes
over the post-war period. By the end of the Second World War, the vast
majority of manufacturing firms provided holidays with pay for manual
workers and this has since been a taken-for-granted aspect of the employ-
ment relationship. Subsequent progress has been in terms of the level of
pay and the length of the holiday.[78] Formal sick-pay schemes for manual
workers also grew rapidly during the war and in the post-war years.
Typically, eligibility required a minimum period of full-time employment
with the firm and benefits were related to length of service. By the early
1960s, about half of firms had such schemes for manual workers, with


-----

162 Challenges and adjustments

a higher proportion among larger firms. Since then, there has been a
slow increase in coverage and improvements in provisions.[79] Pension
schemes for manual workers grew rapidly in the first two decades after
the war. In 1936 about 2.5 million employees belonged to employer-based
schemes; by 1963 this had risen to over 11 million. Of this total, 7.2
million were private-sector employees of whom 5.7 million were manual
workers.[80] Membership was higher among white-collar than manual
workers, among men than among women, and in the public than in the
private-sector.[81] Since the mid-1960s, the growth of coverage has been
less rapid, but there have been improvements in the provision of
schemes.[82]

A number of points need to be made about the growth of such non-wage
benefits. First, benefits have risen significantly over the post-war period.
Taking total benefits, including payments in kind and various subsidised
services, these have risen in manufacturing industry, as a proportion of
average pre-tax remuneration, from 11.1 per cent in 1964 to 19.4 per cent
in 1981.[83] For the firm, such payments are fixed rather than variable costs
in that the employer is committed to pay them to full-time employees
regardless of fluctuations in output or hours.[84] As such they symbolise
a longer term commitment by the employer to the labour force. Second,
with the exception of paid holidays, they did not come about as a result
of trade union pressure. Government intervention had some effect: for
example, changes in taxation provisions in the post-war years may have
encouraged pensions; on the other hand, it might be argued that the
existence of state schemes may have slowed down the growth of fringe
benefits in Great Britain. Overall, the main impetus seems to have come
from employers.[85] Since benefits tend to be seniority-based and are
non-portable between firms, this would seem to suggest that a prime
objective, on the part of employers, was to attract and retain labour and
to encourage loyalty to the firm. A third point to stress is that fringe
benefits are very unequally distributed, with clerical and managerial staff
enjoying more and better benefits than manual workers. Thus paid holiday
entitlement is less for manual workers; fewer are covered by employer
sickness schemes and these tend to be less generous; and fewer are
members of pension schemes and, again, these are less generous.[86]

In recent years, however, reflecting the growing, albeit slow, internalisa-
tion of the employment relationship, there has been some planned move-
ment towards 'harmonisation'. By this is meant the gradual narrowing
of differences between manual and staff employees (at least those below
managerial level) in terms and conditions of employment. Sometimes
this is referred to as staff status where staff benefits and conditions are
gradually extended to manual workers. In some cases, it takes the form


-----

Employment relations in the post-war period 163

of single status, where all employees are treated on a uniform basis. The
1960s saw some movement in this direction, connected in part with
productivity bargaining, and the trend has continued slowly through the
1970s and up to date.[87] Over time, there has been some narrowing in
conditions such as holiday entitlement and more recently in working
hours. Within many firms there has been some, though a less marked,
equalisation of pension and sickness provisions. However, considerable
differences still exist with respect to liability to lay-off and short-time,
redundancy arrangements, time keeping, and other facilities.[88] Firms
which have led in the movement towards harmonisation, as in other
aspects of employment relations, have tended to be large companies,
especially in capital-intensive and technologically advanced sectors such
as oil refining, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and electronics, and among
these have been a significant proportion of foreign companies.[89] The
initiative for such harmonisation has not come from the government;
nor has it usually come from trade unions which have often had an
ambivalent attitude. For the most part, as a recent report has stressed,
'the initiative for harmonisation has nearly always come from manage-
ment'.[90] Aims may have varied at different times: in the 1960s an important
aim was to improve recruitment and retention of labour; since the 1970s
the desire to improve the flexibility of working has been more important.
However, in all cases a significant factor has been to increase commitment
and common purpose and to bind workers to the enterprise through an
extension of non-wage benefits.[91]

**Conclusions**

In the years since the Second World War there have been significant
changes in the employment relationship. These may be seen as an acceler-
ated decline of old-style paternalism and the development of a more
modern bureaucratic paternalism; or they may be seen as a movement
from a 'commodity' to a 'welfare' concept of employment, with workers
becoming less of a 'variable' and more of a 'fixed' cost; or they may be
seen in terms of the development of strategies of internalisation and the
growth of more structured internal labour markets. In whatever way they
are appraised, they have represented, for many workers, a lengthening
and deepening of the employment relationship which, when seen in
long-term historical perspective, has become more stable and more com-
plex. However, again, it needs to be stressed that these developments in
Great Britain in the direction of internalised employment systems, have
been slow and unsteady, certainly in comparision with the larger firm

sector in the US, Germany, and Japan, where for the most part internal
labour markets are stronger and more structured.
This poses two interrelated questions: why has there been a growth of
such arrangements in the post-Second World War period in Britain and
why has it been relatively slow and unsteady?
Trade unions have played some part in shaping these developments.
They have had a positive effect on the growth of internal labour markets
both directly and indirectly. Directly they have pressed for certain types
of arrangements, such as 'last in, first out' procedures, guaranteed week
agreements, fall-back wages, and internal promotions. Indirectly, it is
arguable that the threat unions have posed led employers to react by
developing certain countermeasures which facilitated the growth of inter-
nal labour markets, such as single-employer bargaining, new day wage
systems, and procedures for handling discipline and redundancy.
Moreover, once such arrangements were in place, trade unions have
defended them, though often at the expense of less well-organised and
less advantaged groups.[92] On the other hand, British trade unions have
had a retarding effect on the growth of internal labour markets. Unions
were traditionally suspicious of management-initiated changes in pay
systems and fringe-benefit schemes and they preferred to look, for welfare
and health benefits, to the state rather than to employers. Moreover, the
existence of multiunionism and the fragmented nature of trade unions
in Britain may also have militated against some internal labour market-
type arrangements by making it difficult to institute promotion and
transfer systems and plant- or company-wide systems of wages and
conditions. In particular, craft unions, with their insistence on apprentice-
ships, traditional demarcations, and craft rates, may have impeded the
growth of internal labour markets in Britain. Overall, it might be con-
cluded that the motives of trade unions have been too mixed and their
strength insufficient to be the predominant determinant of internal labour
market arrangements.
Governments played some part. During the Second World War, govern-
ment regulations and interventions in industry set new standards of job
security and welfare facilities. In the 1960s and 1970s legislation on
contracts of employment, redundancy, dismissals, and employment pro-
tection helped formalise arrangements and, for a time, statutory support
for training may have encouraged firm-based provision in this area also.
However, governments may also have retarded the growth of internal
labour markets. The extension of welfare provisions such as pensions,
sick pay, and unemployment benefit may have made corporate provision
less likely than in countries such as the US and Japan. Paradoxically, in
the 1980s, the reversal of some of these policies, the removal of employ-

ment rights, and the emphasis on a more market-orientated approach to
the employment relationship may also have discouraged the growth of
internal labour markets. Overall, the argument presented above has been
that government action tended not to initiate changes in the employment
relationship, but rather to extend and formalise them.
The conclusion must therefore be that it was employers who took the
main initiative as they increasingly adopted strategies of internalisation,
especially during the first three decades of post-war full employment.
Leaders were large firms in certain sectors of the economy, especially
chemicals, oil refining, and some modern sectors of engineering and,
among these, foreign multinationals played a significant role. Such firms
had both the motivation and the capability to establish and administer
internal labour systems. Different considerations may have motivated
different aspects of internal labour markets. Thus, for example, liberal
paternalist concerns may have been behind the provision of welfare and
sick-pay schemes by some employers; in other firms concern to retain
labour may have been more important in the introduction of benefits
such as pension schemes; considerations of industrial relations and labour
discipline may have been behind the establishment of dismissals pro-
cedures and the reform of pay systems. It was difficult for employers ex
_ante to calculate the costs and benefits of different policies and only_
later have the efficiency advantages of certain arrangements been recog-
nised. Thus the ex post reasons for maintaining arrangements may have
been different from the initial reasons for establishing them.
It was also on the employer's side that substantial barriers to change
were to be found. Many British firms continued to prefer policies of
externalisation and were disinclined to develop internal labour market
arrangements. Among managements, conservative attitudes persisted,
and there was a reluctance to see labour as a fixed rather than a variable
cost, let alone as an asset. In part this may have been rational given that
firms had to weigh any advantages against potential losses in terms of
costs and reduced flexibility. There was also a reluctance among British
employers to give anything away at a time when unions were pushing
for concessions anyway. In addition, fragmented structures and policies
in weakly co-ordinated British firms were an obstacle, slowing down the
introduction of plant- and company-wide wage and benefit systems.
Two major qualifications need to be registered against this account of
the growth of internal labour markets. In the first place such arrangements
have not covered all the workforce. In industries characterised by small
firms, highly competitive product markets, low capital-to-labour ratios,
and low skill requirements, such as textiles and clothing, they are less
common. Within industries there are also differences, according to size,


-----

166 Challenges and adjustments

corporate structure, and ownership. Within firms there are differences
between managerial, clerical, and blue-collar workers and between skilled
and less skilled workers.[93] Within multidivisional firms, differences can
also exist between different divisions of the company, with stronger
internal labour markets in divisions where skills are higher or more
specific than in other divisions where skills are less or more general in
nature.[94] On the basis of such observations, some have suggested that
there is a growing duality within the labour market between primary and
secondary sectors. In the primary sector of the market, workers tend to
enjoy relatively secure jobs, some chance of advancement, high basic
wages and the provision of fringe benefits. In other words, structured
internal labour markets exist. In the secondary sector, turnover (voluntary
and involuntary) is higher, there is less training, promotion opportunities
are poor, and wages and benefits inferior.[95] For the most part workers
are unable to move from secondary into primary jobs and economic
forces prevent the convergence of the two sectors. However, one must
be sceptical about the growth of such a duality,[96] since it may be no
more marked today than in the past and, when viewed in long-term
historical perspective, the overall tendency has been towards an internali-
sation of the employment relationship.
The second qualification is that in the 1980s, as a consequence of
recession, increased competition, and technological change, internal
labour market arrangements in many individual firms have come under
strain. The economic situation led to an increased number of redundan-
cies and plant closures and a heightened sense for many of job insecurity.
Employers, it is argued, have sought increased employment flexibility
and have organised jobs within the firm into a core of primary workers
and a periphery of less secure and more disadvantaged workers. This
view is consistent with the growth of part-time female employment,
temporary work, and subcontracting. However, again some scepticism
is required. Much of the growth of externalised types of employment is
a result of structural changes in the economy and the growth of sectors
where such forms of work have always been more common. It may also
reflect supply-side preferences on the part of female workers rather than
demand-side strategies on the part of employers. There are also limits
to this form of externalisation and important countertendencies.[97] Redun-
dancy for some may strengthen the attachment of remaining workers
and it may also make employers more careful in their hiring practices.
Employees, with rising expectations, demand greater security and
benefits; unions oppose casualisation or impose a cost on its introduction;
and, despite amendments to legislation, the law imposes certain con-
straints. Above all, employers see certain efficiency and control advan-

tages in maintaining internal labour markets. Overall, taking a long-term
perspective, the tendency has been towards an internalisation of the
employment relationship. However, change in Britain has come about
slowly and unevenly, reflecting the ad hoc approach of most British
employers, and traditional attitudes and practices towards the employ-
ment relationship remain strong.

### Markets, firms, and the management of labour

The purpose of this book has been to examine the development of labour
management in Britain from the late nineteenth century more or less up
to the present. It has argued that historically most British employers
externalised many aspects of labour management and only slowly and
hesitantly built strong internal structures. The fact that there were always
exceptions to this general pattern and that a few large firms pursued
strategies of internalisation is explained in terms of different market
contexts, corporate structures and managerial hierarchies, and produc-
tion technologies. In the following section the argument is summarised
chronologically. The next section then reformulates the conclusions in
more thematic terms. A final section reverts to the propositions outlined
in Chapter 1 and draws some broader conclusions.

**A chronological overview**

The British economy in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries
was characterised by a large number of small, family-owned and
-managed enterprises catering for highly differentiated markets at home
and abroad. Internally within most firms managerial hierarchies were
weak, and owners often relied on various forms of sub-contracting and
on largely independent foremen for workplace control. Some large enter-
prises existed, notably the railway companies, the gas companies, and a
few manufacturing firms, and these had more extensive managerial
hierarchies. From the 1870s onwards, British entrepreneurs witnessed an
intensification in foreign competition, especially from Germany and the
US, and there was a growing recognition of this competitive threat. One
response was the merger wave at the turn of the century. However, this
mainly resulted in loose defensive amalgamations held together as hold-
ing companies and there was a failure to develop more sophisticated
managerial hierarchies. Another response to competitive pressures took
the form in many industries of periodic attempts at market collusion via
trade associations.

172 Conclusions

Control over work tended to be delegated: inside subcontracting per-
sisted in some industries; foremen had wide discretion in organising and
monitoring production; and in craft industries skilled workers had con-
siderable control over the production process. Given the lack of stan-
dardisation in many products, there were substantial inputs of both
unskilled and craft labour at various stages of production. In part because
of the ready availability of labour, including skilled craft labour, techno-
logical change came relatively slowly and, by the late nineteenth century,
Britain had already fallen behind the US and Germany in certain key
industries such as machine tools, electrical products, and motor vehicles
which were more physical- and human-capital-intensive. However, in
some sectors, such as chemicals and food processing, there were substan-
tial changes and a more extensive division of labour emerged. Overall
the main formal method whereby skills were acquired was the traditional
apprenticeship system. This entailed delegation of training res-
ponsibilities to senior workers and training in all-round skills intended
to produce workers who were craft- and not firm-orientated. In these
circumstances craft workers acquired centrality and had a considerable
degree of control over production processes.
For the most part employers pursued a laissez-faire approach to the
employment relationship; confronted by a buyer's market for labour,
they accepted little responsibility for employment security and welfare;
job tenure was precarious for most workers, and benefits were minimal.
It was expected that wages would fluctuate with market forces or with
levels of output and, from the late nineteenth century, there was an
increased reliance on payment by results. However, in many firms tradi-
tional forms of paternalism persisted on a personal and ad hoc basis.
More significantly for the future, in a few large firms, on the railways
and in some areas of manufacturing, there were the beginnings of more
complex bureaucratic employment systems with longer-term jobs, promo-
tion hierarchies, and more extensive benefits.
A significant development in the late Victorian period was the increased
recognition by employers of trade unions for male manual workers. Along
with recognition, employers took the initiative in developing a system
of regional collective bargaining based on membership of employers'
organisations. The resulting collective agreements established rudimen-
tary machinery for negotiating and handling disputes, set basic wages
and conditions, and attempted to uphold managerial prerogatives.
Though such agreements were mainly regional, before the First World
War there were already a few which had attained a national scope. Yet
most of the agreements remained skeletal and, at workplace level, a


-----

combination of unilateral management regulation, autonomous craft
control, and informal customs and practices were more important.
The First World War saw an increased division of labour in the
munitions industries, but also revealed continued employer dependence
on skilled workers and the economic weakness of certain sectors. During
the war, there was an extension of employee welfare programmes, some
of which continued into peacetime. Of greatest importance in terms of
labour management, wartime conditions brought about a significant
growth of collective bargaining: shopfloor bargaining grew in importance
and, in an attempt to contain it, employers sought to extend formal
bargaining through employers' associations at the industry level.
The interwar economy was marked by sharp fluctuations in demand,
and from 1920 the labour market was characterised by persistently high
unemployment. Through the interwar years, there were important changes
in the structure of the economy, with significant growth of industries
such as motor vehicles, electrical products, chemicals, and food process-
ing. The importance of large firms increased, especially after the merger
wave of the 1920s, and along with this went some elaboration of
managerial hierarchies. However, most large firms continued to be
managed by family members and remained loosely coordinated with
weak managerial structures. In the product market general protection
was introduced in 1932 and restrictive agreements grew both in numbers
and effectiveness. Together these developments weakened competitive
pressures on firms.
In terms of work relations, in the interwar years, there were consider-
able continuities, especially in the old staple industries, but also some
important changes in production techniques and work organisation.
Reliance on unskilled-labour and craft-intensive production remained
strong in many industries. Rather than opting for rationalisation and
mechanisation, employers, for example in coal and cotton, pursued
policies based on work intensification and wage reductions. In other
industries, such as engineering, there was a further extension of payment-
by-result systems aimed at increasing productivity by the use of simple
financial incentives. It was mainly in the newer industries, such as motor
cars and electrical products, that there was a spread of mechanisation
and assembly-line techniques, although, even here, British employers
relied more on labour-intensive methods, indirect control, and piecework
than did their American counterparts.
In the area of employment practices, changes also came slowly. Among
those who kept their jobs during the interwar depression, turnover was
lower and, in this sense at least, attachment to firms stronger. Old-style


-----

174 Conclusions

localised paternalism declined, not least because of the development of
large multi-plant enterprises. In contrast to this, there was some growth
in a more bureaucratic paternalism, with the advent, for some workers,
of fringe benefits such as paid holidays, pension schemes, and sick pay.
Overall, however, high unemployment provided little incentive to innova-
tion in terms and conditions of employment. The same applied to training,
where during the interwar years employers increasingly regarded the
apprenticeship system as a source of cheap labour and failed to develop
the system or create any alternative arrangements.
Employer recognition of trade unions grew substantially during and
immediately after the First World War, and there was a significant
extension of industry-wide, multi-employer bargaining. In this way
employers hoped to avoid workplace bargaining, to defend managerial
prerogatives, and take wages out of competition. Subsequently, through
the interwar depression, when they had the power to make changes if
they had so desired, the employers chose to maintain this system and
did little to develop it further. However, from the recovery of the mid-
19308 onwards, the system of industry-wide bargaining showed increasing
strains. The enforcement of formal managerial rights became more prob-
lematic, unconstitutional strikes occurred, and wages at workplace level
began to drift upwards above nationally negotiated rates.
The Second World War brought about an extension of mass-production
methods and new techniques in the armaments industries. But again it
showed up basic problems associated with traditional methods of produc-
tion and low productivity in the British economy. As in the First War,
there was an extension of welfare arrangements within factories, and
workers experienced greater job security. In wartime circumstances,
further recognition was accorded to trade unions, especially at workplace
level, and there was simultaneously an extension of formal industry-wide
bargaining arrangements.
With the peace began thirty years of economic buoyancy and full
employment, during which the economy experienced faster growth than
ever before, though this proved to be slower than in other industrial
countries. In product markets there was a significant increase in competi-
tion, resulting from trade liberalisation, legislation curtailing restrictive
trading practices, and the emergence of foreign competitors. In the labour
market, employers were for the first time over such a long period confron-
ted by full employment and labour shortages. From the 1960s onwards
the competitive threat was increasingly recognised and prompted new
corporate strategies. In particular the 1960s saw a renewed merger wave
and a trend towards diversification. At first many of these larger firms
continued to be organised on traditional holding-company lines, but


-----

Markets, firms, and the management of labour 175

there was a growing recognition of the need to build better corporate
structures and improved managerial hierarchies. Significant changes in
this respect occurred during the 1970s and 1980s, but weaknesses in terms
of managerial structures and hierarchies persisted which constrained the
development of strategies in the labour management area.
The postwar years were marked by accelerated technical innovation
and changes in work organisation. In addition, management techniques,
especially work study, grew in popularity. However, there was simul-
taneously an increase in restrictive work practices imposed by trade union
members in a tight labour market. Among managers, the reason increas-
ingly given for poor productivity performance was labour relations, and
from the 1960s onwards this became a subject of growing concern among
employers. It became more and more apparent that the formal industry-
wide system of collective bargaining was unable to contain the increase
in workplace bargaining pressures - growing restrictive practices, uncon-
stitutional strikes, and wage settlements in excess of productivity growth.
As a result, from the mid-1960s, employers started to take new initiatives
in the reform of the collective bargaining system. This involved a move
to single-employer bargaining, the reform of wage systems and structures,
and more sophisticated company and plant personnel management.
Viewed in longer term perspective, these constituted a significant transfor-
mation of the British system of collective bargaining.
In a context of full employment and stronger trade unions, management
also had to pay more attention to other aspects of employment policy.
In the postwar period there was an extension of non-wage benefits - paid
holidays, sick pay, and pensions. In addition, from the 1960s onwards
a movement began away from traditional piecework towards time-rated
wage systems and more planned wage structures. Protection against
arbitrary dismissal and rules governing lay-offs and redundancy grew.
In the post-war period there has also been some increase in in-house
training, though this has remained insufficient in both quantity and quality
and is still a significant weakness of the British economy.
It is still too early to discern the effects of changes in the 1980s under
the Thatcher administration. However, a few general points can be made.
In industrial relations, the changed economic, political, and legal situ-
ation created new opportunities and encouraged employer initiatives.
Trade union membership has declined and there have been major
offensives against traditional union control over working practices in
some sectors - motor vehicles, steel, coal mining, printing, and shipping.
Less dramatic, though more significant, initiatives have included a further
decentralisation of bargaining structures, especially to plant level, and
the negotiation of more flexible methods of working. There has been


-----

176 Conclusions

some, though limited, derecognition of trade unions, and firms have also
sought to play down collective bargaining and to develop alternative
consultative channels with their employees. In terms of employment
relations, the economic conditions and a new political rhetoric of markets
and flexibility may have worked against a longer term trend towards
internal labour markets. Certainly there has been some growth in part-
time, temporary, and subcontract working, though mainly in industries
and types of work where it already existed. On the other hand, higher
unemployment has reduced labour turnover and increased worker attach-
ment to firms, and employers have continued to develop internal wage
and benefit systems tailored to their own domestic requirements. In terms
of work relations, under the stimulus of increased competition and taking
advantage of high unemployment, there has been both an increase in
more flexible forms of working and some intensification of the work
process. However, the extent and depth of change in working practices
throughout industry as a whole should not be exaggerated. Moreover,
the pay-offs in terms of greater productivity have been uneven and limited
by continuing weaknesses in managerial capabilities and low levels of
investment in physical and human resources. Taking a broader historical
perspective, it can be said that in the 1980s British employers have built
on the developments of the two previous decades and, in this sense,
change has been incremental rather than discontinuous. At the same
time, the evidence is that their behaviour has often been opportunistic
in nature, in that they have used the combination of economic and
political circumstances to force through changes in an ad hoc and
piecemeal fashion. It is certainly too early to talk about the transformation
of employee relations or the development of a new system of human
resources management in Britain.[1]

**A thematic overview**

These conclusions may be reformulated in a more thematic manner. First,
the arguments about markets, corporate structures and hierarchies, and
technology and the division of labour are recapitulated. Then, attention
is given to the three main decision areas which have been identified - work
relations, employment relations, and industrial relations. An attempt is
also made to draw some conclusions on the long-term economic con-
sequences of managerial policies and practices.
Taking product markets first, a significant characteristic of many British
product markets in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was their
fragmented nature as firms attempted to differentiate their product and

often produced for a wide range of markets. This had a profound effect
on labour management, slowing down change in production technologies,
encouraging labour-intensive methods, and supporting craft unionism.
In Commons' term, the extent of the market and the 'competitive menace'
grew in most industries in the late nineteenth and early twentieth cen-
turies. Until the 1930s, Britain was committed to free trade and was a
particularly open economy. However, a number of qualifications must
be made. The markets which British manufacturers served were often
highly fragmented and differentiated; British producers had advantages
in widespread Empire markets; and, from time to time, in most trades
there were periods of collusion in the form of market-sharing and price-
fixing. Such collusion increased during the period of protection from the
early 1930s to the 1950s. Thereafter, there was a re-opening and extension
of markets, a reorientation of trade towards more demanding European
and US markets, and an increasing competitive challenge to British
industry which has grown through each successive decade. Each of these
different stages of market development had important consequences for
the management of labour.
In the case of labour markets, it is important to stress that before the
1950s, with the exception of the two world wars, there was usually an
excess supply of labour in Britain, including craft labour. This affected
labour management in a number of ways: above all, it encouraged reliance
on unskilled-labour and craft-intensive methods of production and
slowed down the growth of internal labour market arrangements. It also
biased the demand for other skills and discouraged the development of
managerial and technical improvements. The post-Second World War
years saw full employment up to the 1970s and periodic shortages of
skilled labour especially at cycle peaks. This stimulated changes in the
division of labour and led employers to develop more extensive employ-
ment provisions and internal labour markets. Mobility between jobs,
though always subject to cyclical factors, has shown a long-term down-
ward trend.
To re-state the argument about corporate structure and managerial
hierarchy. The British economy was long dominated by small, single-unit,
family-owned and -managed enterprises (S-form firms, to use William-
son's terminology[2]). Even where large, multi-unit firms emerged, as in
the merger waves of the 1890s and 1920s, these tended to take the form
of loosely coordinated holding companies (H-form) in which family
control remained strong, subsidiaries were allowed considerable
autonomy, and traditional methods of administration persisted. There
were a few large more unified firms with more elaborate managerial
hierarchies organised on functional lines (U-form). In most firms

managerial and supervisory systems remained weak: personal manage-
ment often persisted at senior levels; managers were poorly educated
and trained; and levels and functions were inadequately integrated.
Labour management was left to line managers and foremen within the
firm and was delegated to employers' organisations outside the firm. In
the early post-Second World War years, there was considerable con-
tinuity. Only later, after the mergers and diversifications of the 1960s,
did an increasing number of large firms develop multidivisional forms
of organisation, with centralised control over strategic matters and devol-
ution of operational decisions to product divisions (M-form). At the
same time firms began to pay more attention to management development,
not least in the personnel field. However, despite such changes, there is
still abundant evidence that corporate structures in Britain remain weak
and management is still less well educated and trained than its foreign
counterparts, with particular weaknesses at production and operational
level. In recent years further moves towards decentralisation and the
pressure of short-term financial considerations may have constrained
long-term strategic thinking in the human resource management area.
Turning to technology and the division of labour, it was argued that
in many sectors technological change developed very slowly and many
British firms remained committed to traditional technologies and patterns
of work organisation. The continued prominence of the older staple
industries before the Second World War meant that such methods con-
tinued and even in newer sectors Britain lagged behind some of its main
competitors in the introduction of more sophisticated production tech-
nologies. There was some catching up during the period from 1920 to
1930, but subsequently Britain fell behind again in terms of technological
innovation.
In terms of work relations (defined as the organisation of work and
the way workers are organised around technology and processes), from
the late nineteenth century onwards, failure to create strong organisa-
tional structures and effective managerial hierarchies reduced the ability
to take full advantage of integration and rationalisation of production.
In addition, the fragmented nature of markets and the availability and
strength of labour reduced the incentive to press ahead with standardisa-
tion, mechanisation, and a greater division of labour. Many British firms,
therefore, continued to rely on relatively labour-intensive methods and
looked to reduce labour costs by holding down wages and by an
intensification of work. They paid less attention than their foreign
counterparts to upgrading the quality of their labour force. On the other
hand, this did not mean that there was a strategic management drive to
deskill work in a way suggested by Braverman.[3] British management had


-----

Markets, firms, and the management of labour 179

no such strategy. The demand for new skills was always being created,
and labour often retained considerable power in the production process.
Weak managerial control over production and poor operational manage-
ment have been factors contributing to the poor productivity performance
of British industry.
In terms of employment relations (defined as covering the way people
are recruited and employed, job tenure and promotion, and wage and
benefit arrangements), most British employers did not build strong inter-
nal labour systems, but relied more on market mechanisms for obtaining
labour, fixing its price, and disposing of workers as supply and demand
dictated. From managements' point of view, apprenticeship training and
informal on-the-job learning usually provided an adequate supply of
skilled labour. Yet this lack of attention to employment relations is not
to deny the existence of a traditional paternalism in British industry.
Over time, however, this became less sustainable, with the growth of
large multi-plant and managerially controlled enterprises. Historically,
only a few large firms developed more extensive internal employment
systems. These tended to be in industries where firms had the incentive
(in terms of attracting and retaining skills), the resources (in terms of
product market success), and the organisational capability (in terms of
corporate structure and managerial hierarchy) to institute and develop
such systems. Yet, from the 1930s onwards, accelerating through the
post-war period, there was a growth of more bureaucratic internal
employment systems with more impersonal rules and formal wage and
benefit systems. Along with this went some increase in internal training
systems but, on the whole, training has remained a continuing weakness
of British firms. Overall internal labour market arrangements are still
relatively weaker in Britain than in the USA, Germany, or Japan.
In terms of industrial relations (defined as covering systems of rep-
resentation, management-union relations, and the process of collective
bargaining), at a relatively early date compared to other countries, British
employers recognised unions for male manual workers, though usually
subject to a formal insistence on managerial prerogatives. From the late
nineteenth century, employers in most industries developed systems of
regional and then national collective bargaining based on membership
of employers' organisations. These systems of industry-wide, multi-
employer bargaining were consolidated during and after the First World
War. Among their advantages for employers were that they economised
on the costs of developing domestic arrangements; they set standards
for wages and conditions with the intention of keeping down competitive
pressures; and they helped contain conflict and appeared to minimise
trade union interference at the workplace. However, the systems were


-----

180 Conclusions

always skeletal and, for the most part, failed to regulate pay, conditions,
and working practices at the level of the workplace. In particular they
were subject to periodic challenges by shopfloor workers during periods
of economic prosperity. In the post-1945 period, as the Donovan Com-
mission showed, they increasingly failed to perform the regulatory func-
tions intended by employers: restrictive practices and unconstitutional
strikes grew, shopfloor bargaining challenged managerial prerogatives,
and earnings drifted upwards. In their place, therefore, from the 1960s
onwards, employers slowly created a different system of single-employer
bargaining at plant, divisional, or company levels. This involved the
development of internal personnel management, the negotiation of more
formal agreements with shop stewards, and the reform of procedures
and wage systems.[4]

In the 1980s there have been contradictory trends in terms of employer
policies of externalisation and internalisation. On the one hand,
economic, political, and organisational factors have induced employers
to pursue strategies of externalisation. For example, as already noted,
there has been some increase in sub-contracting and other delegated
forms of work organisation. Along with this, in terms of employment
conditions, employers have resorted to part-time and temporary work.
In the early 1980s employers reacted to recession in the traditional manner
by making workers redundant; again in the early 1990s' recession, despite
much talk about human resource planning and treating employees as
assets, employers have again resorted to redundancy to deal with
economic fluctuations. The Thatcher government in part encouraged
externalisation in areas such as training by emphasising the transferability
of training and favouring qualifications which are generally recognised.
Training remains a considerable shortcoming, and through the 1980s'
upswing firms relied on recruiting in the external labour market and
paying whatever wages were necessary to meet labour shortages. The
government also sought to increase market forces by such measures as
the reduction of employment protection legislation, the promotion of
regional pay differences, and the encouragement of portable pensions.
On the other hand, there have been continuing trends towards internalisa-
tion. In terms of employment relations, labour turnover has fallen and
the average length of jobs probably rose through the 1980s. More attention
has been given by management to selection, appraisal, and the use of
internal transfers and promotions.[5] Where firms have themselves taken
the initiative in terms of training, improvements have tended to be of an
internal and firm-specific nature.[6] In the case of wage systems there has
been a growth in arrangements which stress inside factors such as perfor-
mance and productivity rather than outside factors such as the cost of


-----

Markets, firms, and the management of labour 181

living and the rate for the job. In terms of benefit systems there has been
a continuing trend towards the harmonisation of terms and conditions
of manual and non-manual employees. In industrial relations a number
of major trends must be reiterated. The trend towards single-employer
bargaining has continued and along with this has gone an increased
dependence of workplace trade unionism on the employer for its
operation. Alongside this there has been a growth in other kinds of
consultative arrangements and forms of employee involvement which
are essentially domestic in nature and intended to increase organisational
identity and loyalty. Overall, despite contradictory tendencies, the general
tendency would seem to be a continuing slow and uneven move towards
strategies of internalisation, though the evidence casts some doubt on
how consciously or strategically employers are pursuing such policies.[7]

At this stage, it is appropriate to take up two further questions posed
in the introduction. First, can the actions of British employers be said
to constitute labour strategies and to what extent were their actions
congruent with broader business strategies and structures? Second, what
effect did labour management practices have on broader business perfor-
mance?
The benefit of a historical perspective is that it enables one to discern
long-term patterns of action. Historically, the vast majority of British
employers did not have strategies in the sense of long-term, consciously
devised, coherent policies. However, they did act in the long-term with
a certain degree of regularity and they did make decisions which when
viewed cumulatively reveal a clear pattern of behaviour over time. In
Mintzberg[:]s terms, they had strategies which were enacted rather than
_intended and which developed incrementally over time.[8] Yet, there were_
always a few exceptional firms, including always a significant number
of foreign-owned companies, which had more planned and coherent
strategies, and over the years the number of these increased, especially
from the late 1960s onwards. Significantly, the leaders in developing
more planned and articulated strategies were often leading firms in their
markets, in their organisational structures, and in their managerial hierar-
chies.
Historically, the predominant strategies, which have been described
here as ones of externalisation, had a certain rationality about them - at
least in the short- and medium-term. They suited broader business
strategies in that they were largely reactive to market conditions. They
also suited weak organisational and managerial structures since firms
did not have the organisational capability to develop and administer
more elaborate internal policies. In this sense, they were both a rational
response to market circumstances and a functional necessity given weak


-----

182 Conclusions

organisational and managerial structures. However, as foreign com-
petitors discovered the advantages of alternative strategies and arrange-
ments, externalisation became less and less appropriate. Much of the
history of labour management over the postwar years may be seen as a
hesitant and uncertain attempt to change direction and develop stronger
strategies of internalisation.
On the effect of labour management strategies on business and
economic performance, in long term perspective, factors other than those
connected with the management of labour were probably more important
in influencing economic performance. In this book a number of these
factors have been stressed. In many sectors of British industry, small or
loosely coordinated larger firms, with weak managerial hierarchies, failed
effectively to manage innovation and production. In part this resulted
from the fact that they relied for too long on fragmented, diverse, and
sometimes captive markets and failed to obtain economies of scale and
scope in production and marketing.[9] Investment levels in Britain fluctu-
ated considerably over time, but at certain key periods, in particular in
the Edwardian period and again in the post-Second World War period,
the growth of investment, especially in key potential growth sectors, was
slower than in other competitor countries.[10] Whilst these factors were
more important than those concerned with labour or the management
of labour, it must be conceded that such factors reinforced one another.
As Ulman commented on the postwar British economy, 'old fashioned
plant and equipment furnishes a most hospitable environment for the
perpetuation of old fashioned working habits and related institutional
arrangements, just as the hardiness of the latter might constitute an
effective obstacle to more ambitious investment projects'.[11]

Turning therefore to problems of labour and its management, it would
be wrong to conclude that British workers through their trade unions
did not at certain periods have an adverse effect on economic performance
in certain industries. It is highly likely that the strength of trade unions
at times in the late nineteenth century, between 1910 and 1920, and again
in the first three post-Second World War decades, affected the perform-
ance of certain industries. Recent econometric studies have suggested
that trade unions had a slight negative effect on manufacturing produc-
tivity growth in the 1970s and that a reduction of their power in certain
industries contributed to increased productivity growth in the 1980s.[12]

However, outside industries such as coal mining in the first half of the
twentieth century or motor vehicles in the post-Second World War period,
this effect was uneven and has probably been exaggerated. In other
sectors, as diverse as footwear or electronics, where trade unionism was
never particularly strong, it is difficult to attribute poor performance to


-----

Markets, firms, and the management of labour 183

the activities of trade unions. The thesis of this book has been that action
and inaction on the management side has been more important.
In terms of work relations, it has been argued that British employers
showed a preference for labour-intensive methods of production as an
alternative to expensive capital investment. Moreover they were often
not particularly good at managing more advanced production systems.
Senior management relied excessively on delegated forms of control and
never showed any great interest in scientific management or production
engineering. Rather they attempted to assert broad notions of managerial
prerogatives and resorted to an intensification of effort by workers,
especially in the 1890s, 1920s, and 1930s, and again in the 1980s. For
the postwar period we have evidence that British firms' relative produc-
tivity has tended to fall as the need for managerial sophistication has
risen and that British firms have had a large productivity disadvantage
in industries characterised by large plants and assembly-type operations.[13]

Less competent at managing production than their foreign counterparts,
they failed to win the respect of their shopfloor workers.[14] Significantly
also, in Britain, foreign-owned companies have been more successful
than British-owned companies in obtaining high levels of productivity,
suggesting that the problem is less one of inefficient workers than of poor
management.[15]

In terms of employment relations, one of the main shortcomings of
British employers has been their failure to train the labour force at all
levels, from management down to the shopfloor. There has been a
long-term underinvestment in human capital which continues up to the
present and which has adversely affected the ability of workers to improve
the quantity and quality of production.[16] The effect of the failure to
develop strong internal labour market-type arrangements is more debat-
able. However, recent theoretical developments in labour economics
would lend support to the notion that certain types of employment
contracts are likely to elicit more commitment and higher productivity:
these are those which offer greater job security, internal promotion, and
hierarchical wage and benefit scales which reward workers according to
contribution and seniority rather than market forces.[17] Historically, in
Britain, job insecurity, the use of variable piecework systems, and limited
benefits for blue-collar workers have often been behind lack of trust and
cooperation. As one early study of restrictive practices concluded, The
more the workpeople suffer from unemployment and fluctuating wages,
the more restrictive their attitude is likely to be.'[18]

In terms of industrial relations, it must again be stated that unions
and their activities have at various times and in various sectors had an
adverse effect on productivity growth. However, industrial relations are


-----

184 Conclusions

always a two-way relationship. British employers, for their part, relied
too much on employers' organisations and did not for many years develop
effective internal systems to meet the representational aspirations of their
workforces and to deal with workplace trade unionism. In their rhetoric,
they insisted on managerial prerogatives, but in practice they allowed
incursions into managerial authority which their counterparts overseas
did not tolerate. In the post-Second World War period they were slow
to develop new and effective collective bargaining and consultative
arrangements which might have encouraged more positive industrial
relations. True to market principles, they often approached industrial
relations in a short-term and opportunistic manner, for example, taking
advantage of trade unions in bad times and having to suffer the adverse
consequences of this when circumstances have changed. Taken together,
these managerial actions and inactions have played a large part in
influencing the productive performance of British industry.
Strategies of externalisation may have given British employers some
comparative advantage in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
But as the potential of mass markets and mass-production technologies
developed in the twentieth century, such strategies became less appropri-
ate. However, the forces of institutional inertia were complex and strong.
In the latter half of the twentieth century the demand for higher quality
and more flexible production has led to a further need for a change in
strategies emphasising more skilled work and more positive industrial
relations and permitting employers to use new technologies to their
maximum potential. In essence, the argument presented in this book has
been that changes in this direction came about only slowly and unevenly
in Britain and that this has had major consequences for industrial perfor-
mance and national competitiveness.

**Some theoretical conclusions**

In Chapter 1 a number of propositions were outlined. These may be
restated as follows. First, markets, for both labour and final products,
are key independent variables influencing labour management decisions.
Second, corporate strategies and structures are significant intervening
variables shaping strategy and structure in the labour field. Third, the
nature and quality of the managerial hierarchy is a further important
factor influencing labour management. Fourth, technology and the
division of labour also shape labour decisions. Finally, firms make labour
decisions which can be conceptualised in terms of internalising transac-
tions within the firm or externalising them in the market. Where do these
propositions now stand after the presentation of the detailed historical
narrative?

Markets, firms, and the management of labour 185

The notion of internalising and externalising can be used to analyse
managerial strategies in the labour area. It was employed to understand
the slow growth of internal labour systems in Britain where employers
long relied on external markets for labour supply and wage fixing. It
was also used to examine various aspects of work relations. For example,
it was employed to describe the historical move from various forms of
subcontracting to more direct forms of work organisation. More contem-
poraneously, in different economic circumstances, it can be used to
understand the reemergence of various forms of sub-contracting, tem-
porary, and part-time working. It can be used to focus on one important
aspect of training, namely whether training is organised under company
control and is firm-specific, or whether it is more market-orientated. The
concept, it is hoped, also helped to locate the significance of industry-wide
multi-employer bargaining which was analysed as a form of externalisa-
tion and the growth of single-employer bargaining which was seen as a
form of internalisation.
However, it is necessary to add a number of qualifications and elabor-
ations to this basic proposition. Internalising and externalising should
certainly not be seen as outcomes predetermined by economic costs and
benefits in a simple neo-classical sense. Employers always had a choice,
but their ability to choose was dependent on market and technological
constraints and on organisational characteristics and capabilities. This
also means that internalising and externalising should not be seen in
terms of a precise calculation of costs and benefits. Employers did not
have the information on such costs and benefits ex ante and, even ex
_post, could usually not assess the effects of different courses of action._
However, the fact that they were not known precisely does not mean
that employers were not aware that there were costs and benefits of
alternative courses of action, especially when market and competitive
pressures on them were strong.
Moreover, internalising and externalising should not be seen as a
simple dichotomy. There were intermediate forms. Thus the use of
employers' organisations may perhaps best be seen as 'coordination by
cooperation' rather than by the firm or the market.[19] Within any one firm
there could be a mixture of strategies. For example, different strategies
often existed for different groups of workers: managerial, technical, white
collar, skilled, and unskilled were treated differently usually reflecting
different market situations. In addition, it must be added that, over time,
there could be backward and forward movement in terms of the use of
strategies, depending on the degree of market competition, market change
or stability, and organisational capabilities.
This book has tended to stress the benefits of internalisation. It is also
necessary to recapitulate some of the disadvantages. For the employer,


-----

186 Conclusions

internalisation can mean heavy fixed costs and inflexibility in terms of
the ability to make adjustments to market forces. It can also mean the
loss of certain advantages which come from cooperating with other firms
through employers' organisations in terms of regulating the labour market
and providing joint services. For the employee, internalisation can mean
reduced mobility and dependence on the firm, especially where there are
inadequate internal systems of representation and due process. Indeed,
many years ago the American economist Ross warned of the dangers of
internalisation as a new form of industrial feudalism.[20] For peripheral
workers and potential employees outside the firm, internalisation can
mean exclusion from good jobs, training opportunities, and relatively
generous pay and benefits. This can, of course, be a cost for society
which should then provide alternative arrangements. In terms of the
national economy there may be other disadvantages, especially where
insider wage fixing and the lack of coordination between firms create
inflationary wage pressures. In Britain in the 1980s, despite high unem-
ployment, insider forces led to annual earnings increases in key industries
which were higher than the rate of inflation and higher than in competitor
countries; these then spread throughout the economy because of the lack
of any coordination of wage fixing. Thus strategies of internalisation, or
at least incomplete internalisation, may not always produce an efficient
outcome at the aggregate level. This suggests that what is required is a
combination of arrangements which include internalisation, market
forces, interfirm coordination, and government action. Overall, however,
the argument of this book has been that the benefits of internalisation
outweigh the costs and that strategies of internalisation have more advan-
tages than disadvantages.
As to the proposition about environmental factors, market forces were
important independent variables shaping labour management decisions.
Labour markets had a direct effect, product markets a more indirect
influence. In the labour market, the relatively abundant supply of labour
in Britain during most periods up to the Second World War inhibited
the division of labour. It also constrained the development of internal
labour market-type arrangements since there was little incentive to by-
pass the external market and create elaborate internal labour systems.
The state of demand in the labour market directly affected industrial
relations in that it shaped the opportunism which was often the hallmark
of employer policies, inducing cooperative attitudes in times of prosperity
and adversarial attitudes in times of recession.[21] As to the product market,
fragmentation constrained the division of labour and held back the
modernisation of work and deskilling tendencies in Great Britain. Slow
growth and fluctuations in the product market did not provide the


-----

Markets, firms, and the management of labour 187

conditions for the development of strong internal employment systems.
In terms of collective bargaining arrangements, the development of
regional and national markets lay behind the emergence of regional and
national collective bargaining, and collusion in the product market sup-
ported multi-employer bargaining. In the postwar period, as product
markets extended internationally, as collusion became more difficult, and
as competition intensified, firms changed their bargaining strategies and
tried to link changes in wages and conditions more closely to productivity
movements within the firm.
The propositions about the firm were that corporate structures and
managerial hierarchies also had an important effect on labour manage-
ment. The traditional small firm and the loosely coordinated holding
company, with their weak managerial control systems, went a long way
to explain the persistence of a craft division of labour and weaknesses
in successfully introducing modern work systems. They also contributed
to both traditional paternalism and the slow development of more
bureaucratic employment systems. In terms of industrial relations, weak
corporate structures and managerial hierarchies lay behind the long-term
reliance on employers' organisations and the tardy development of
domestic industrial relations arrangements. In the early post-war period,
their persistence explains the emergence of fragmented shopfloor bargain-
ing. Later, the development of more centralised structures and stronger
hierarchies allowed a few firms to pursue a tighter control over the labour
process, more bureaucratic employment practices, and more centralised
internal dealings with trade unions. Historically, ICI and Ford are good
examples of firms which early made these choices.
Thus market, technological, and organisational forms have been impor-
tant in shaping labour management strategies. However, this is not to
deny that there were other forces operating. The influence of the state,
both negative and positive, also had an important effect, especially at
certain key points in time. At the most fundamental level, from the
nineteenth century onwards, the support for laissez-faire employment
principles and non-intervention in the employment relationship provided
the basis for polices of externalisation. Similarly, the provision from the
nineteenth century onwards of legal immunities for unions and later the
support for collective bargaining, especially during the period of the two
world wars and in the post-Second World War years, had an important
effect on British industrial relations. In the 1980s the Thatcher administra-
tion, with its commitment to market principles and individualism and
its introduction of legal restraints on unions, has also had a significant
effect on the conduct of industrial relations, by reshaping the agenda
and making possible what had previously seemed difficult for employers

188 Conclusions

to attain. However, the argument of this book has been that on the whole,
seen in long-term perspective, the role of the state has been less important
than that of employers and government activity has tended for the most
part to extend and confirm already existing trends.
Some independent effect has to be assigned to the actions of trade
unions. In Britain the strength of craft unionism, the persistence of
workplace organisation, and the complexities of multi-unionism had an
effect on the division of labour, employment practices, and collective
bargaining arrangements. However, union impact has tended to be exag-
gerated in both popular and academic commentary. Employers had
initiatory power, while union power was largely reactive and negative.
Ultimately employers made the decisions, or failed to make the decisions,
which counted most. A corollary worthy of further investigation is that
corporate structure and management choice of bargaining arrangements
had a substantial effect on the organisation and power structure of trade
unions in Britain. Thus, traditional structures provided the basis for craft
unionism in the nineteenth century; the resort to employers' organisations
led to increasing centralisation of union organisation and decision-
making in the early twentieth century; the persistence of loose forms of
corporate organisation and the weakness of employers' associations in
Britain ensured the strength of fragmented shopfloor unionism through
the first three postwar decades; more recently the development of stronger
corporate structures has encouraged a more enterprise-orientated trade
unionism.
Ideological and cultural factors were also important in shaping labour
decisions. In the context of British industrial history, there were certain
attitudes which had considerable tenacity: in employment relations a
mixture of laissez-faire individualism and moral notions of paternalism;
in work relations a 'gentlemanly' lack of interest on the part of many
senior managers and a belief in the 'practical' approach on the part of
many lower level managers;[22] in industrial relations a belief in maintain-
ing managerial prerogatives at the cost of developing closer consultative
and better bargaining arrangements. Such traditional attitudes were
deeply entrenched and affected the choice of labour strategies. However,
there are a number of major problems with ideological and cultural
arguments: their origins have to be explained and located in historical
and institutional contexts: moreover, broad cultural arguments fail to
explain the substantial differences between British firms which have been
pointed out in this book. Taking a long-term perspective, the best interpre-
tation is one which stresses market and technological contexts, corporate
structures and managerial capabilities, and employers' choice of
strategies.


-----

Markets, firms, and the management of labour 189

These conclusions are drawn from the British experience of managing
manual workers in manufacturing and related industries. It is hoped,
however, that the framework may have broader uses. For example it
could be developed by focusing it more specifically on white-collar,
technical, and managerial staff or by extending it to the service sector.
It might also be applied to the public sector (though here inevitably
political forces would weigh more). Most fruitfully, it could be developed
by examining the experiences of different countries. For example, it has
been argued in the course of this book that large American firms have
historically internalised more activities than their British counterparts.
In Japan, large firms have developed a particularly sophisticated mix of
internal policies based on elaborate pay systems, extensive welfare
benefits, and enterprise trade unionism. In the case of Japan, this inter-
nalised system is also supported, however, by strategies of externalisation
via the use of temporary workers and subcontracting. In Germany, large
firms have also developed extensive internal employment systems, with
strong internal labour markets and arrangements for employee rep-
resentation. However, in the German case, this is also complemented by
the use of external multi-employer arrangements for training and collec-
tive bargaining.[23]

This prompts a final and more normative conclusion. If large American,
German, and Japanese firms have been more successful in securing a
more effective and efficient balance between market forces and
administrative coordination, then British employers and policy-makers
need to examine more closely what they have done. It would certainly
be unwise to rely excessively on market based approaches to the manage-
ment of labour. Already there have been substantial improvements in
British corporate structures and managerial hierarchies; industrial rela-
tions have experienced major reforms from the late 1960s onwards; and
management is, in the final decade of the twentieth century, in a stronger
position to bring about further changes. However, the process of adjust-
ment has been slow and many employers have only hesitantly developed
strategies of internalisation. There is still much to be achieved, especially
in terms of the improved organisation of work relations, in employment
conditions and training at all levels, and in terms of more positive
industrial relations. Upon this depends to a great measure the future
success of British industry.

Invisible Hands in Great Britain', in A.D. Chandler and H. Daems (eds.),
_Managerial Hierarchies: Comparative Perspectives on the Rise of the Modern_
_Industrial Enterprise (Cambridge, Mass., 1980). Lazonick has applied a_
similar line of argument to technological innovation and business perform-
ance in Britain, arguing that the reliance on market coordination and the
continued existence of many small firms had adverse consequences for
innovation and performance. See, for example, W. Lazonick, Competitive
_Advantage on the Shopfloor (Cambridge, Mass., 1990) and B. Elbaum and_
W. Lazonick, The Decline of the British Economy (Oxford, 1986).
14. These propositions are set out in the same way as in Chandler, The Visible
_Hand, pp. 6-11._
15. For the term 'organisational capability' see Chandler, Scale and Scope.
Chandler identifies this more with investment in production and distribution
and managerial hierarchies. In this book it is taken more to be a combination
of organisational structure and managerial hierarchy.
16. This is an extension of Adam Smith's dictum that the division of labour is
limited by the extent of the market. See An Enquiry into the Nature and
_Causes of the Wealth of Nations (Methuen, 1904 edn), pp. 9-19._
17. This is taken from G. S. Becker, Human Capital: A Theoretical and Empirical
_Analysis, with Special Reference to Education (New York, 1964)._
18. One of the earliest analyses of the internal labour market is to be found in
C. Kerr, 'The Balkanisation of Labour Markets', in E. W. Bakke et ah,
_Labour Mobility and Economic Opportunity, (Cambridge, Mass., 1954),_
pp. 92-110. For a fuller analysis see P. B. Doeringer and M. J. Piore, Internal
_Labor Markets and Manpower Analysis (Lexington, Mass., 1971)._
19. This term is used in G. B. Richardson, The Organisation of Industry',
_Economic Journal, 83 (1972)._
20. The handshake can be either 'visible' or 'invisible', the contract can be either
'explicit' or 'implicit'. See A. M. Okun, Prices and Quantities: A Micro-
_economic Analysis (Oxford, 1981), Chapter 3._
21. See H. Mintzberg, The Nature of Managerial Work (New York, 1973) and

reports also ascribed inefficiencies to the absence of competitive pressures
in the years between the 1930s and the 1950s. See Hannah, Corporate
_Economy, p. 141. In the case of the motor-car industry, for example, one_
study attributed some of the post-war inefficiencies to the fact that manufac-
turers were able to sell the vast majority of their output in protected markets.

82. Morris was a leader in the early 1920s in introducing new machine tools,
assembly lines, and transfer machines. Austin was at first somewhat less
ambitious, but from the mid 1920s onwards began to reorganise production
machinery and methods at Longbridge. Both owed a debt to American
ideas and methods. Managers from Morris visited the US in 1924 and Austin
bought American machines and used American engineers in reorganising
Longbridge. During the interwar years, Ford, which had first established a
plant at Trafford Park in Manchester in 1911, considerably expanded
production and in 1931 opened its Dagenham plant, probably the best
equipped and organised car plant in Europe at the time. General Motors,
which took over Vauxhall in 1925, substantially reorganised and mechanised
its production facilities in the 1930s. In addition to the assemblers, Briggs
and Pressed Steel were two important suppliers of American origin, which
introduced machine-fed presses and flow line methods to produce car
bodies. W. Lewchuk, 'Fordism and the British Motor Car Employers,
1898-1932', in H. F. Gospel and C. R. Littler (eds.), Managerial Strategies
_and Industrial Relations (1983); W. Lewchuk, American Technology and the_

(Oxford, 1955) pp. 140-1; L. Holden, 'A History of Vauxhall Motors to
1950' (Open University, M.Phil, thesis, 1983).
New mass-production techniques were also adopted in the electrical
products industry, especially by firms producing electric light accessories
and lamps, telephones and telegraph equipment, and domestic appliances.
As in motor vehicles, a small number of leading firms set the pace - GEC,
AEI, Lucas, Plessey, Philips, Mullard, Ferranti, Morphy Richards, and
Electrolux. Single-purpose machine tools were extensively used along with
assembly-line systems. In this sector these resulted in a pronounced sexual
division of labour. Skilled men were employed in the tool room and on
maintenance work, but most of the more repetitive work on the line was
done by semi- and unskilled female labour.

98. In the period of labour shake-out between 1920 and 1924 industrial produc-
tivity rose by 5.6 per cent per annum. The output of mechanical engineering,
for example, rose by 6 per cent in 1920-24, yet the labour force was reduced
by no less than 46 per cent. D. H. Aldcroft, The British Economy Between
_the Wars (Oxford, 1983). p. 49. Overall, through the interwar years, the_
annual rate of growth of productivity per man hour in manufacturing was
2.5 per cent. H. W. Richardson, 'The New Industries Between the Wars',
_Oxford Economic Papers, 13 (1961)._
99. Rostas in a study of labour productivity in 1936 showed that physical output
per man in Germany was between 10 and 20 per cent higher in blast furnaces,
steel smelting, and rolling mills; between 20 and 25 per cent higher in cotton
spinning and artificial fibres; and 50 per cent higher in coal mines and coke
ovens. Comparative figures with the US were even more striking: produc-
tivity was substantially higher in all American industries and enormously
higher in some, with a maximum difference of 200 per cent in blast furnaces.

4 THE EVOLVING EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP

1. D. H. MacGregor, The Evolution of Industry (1911) Chapter 5, talks about
a 'loose' or 'incomplete' or 'imperfect' association. C. R. Littler, The Develop-
_ment of the Labour Process in Capitalist Societies (1982) talks similarly about_
'minimal interaction'.
2. The system of leaving certificates was introduced under s.7 of the 1915
Munitions of War Act and lasted until it was repealed by s.2 of the 1917
Munitions of War Act. Under the system employers were permitted to keep
a man in his job against his will by refusing him a certificate without which
he could not get a job for six weeks after quitting his old employment.
3. Measures on these lines were introduced from the summer of 1940 onwards
and came fully into force with the passage of the Defence Regulations Act
58A of March 1941. Workers in scheduled establishments were not allowed
to leave their employment without giving seven days' notice to both their
employer and the National Service Officer, stating their reasons. Also the
employer was not allowed to discharge an employee (although he could
suspend him) without going through the same procedure or unless the
employee was guilty of serious misconduct. Movement was therefore only
to be for exceptional reasons. In return for this, employers had to pay a
guaranteed week's pay even when there was no work, as long as any stoppage
was due to causes outside the workers' control. A. Bullock, The Life and
_Times of Ernest Bevin, Volume II, 1967, Chapter 5._

rose from 1944-45 onwards and led to a revived interest and a further series

specialist bodies. From 1918 the Industrial Fatigue Research Board and
from 1921 the National Institute of Industrial Psychology pioneered voca-

they commence work at once in the production department.. .There appears
to be a consensus of opinion that a trainer doing a full-time job will
accelerate the training of employees compared with the foreman who already
has his hands full with considerations of efficient production.'

40. Under the three-day continuity rule employees could draw benefit as a
supplement to reduced wages. This led groups of employees to form 'pools'
composed of five or six members who arranged with the employer to 'play',
i.e. to be temporarily laid off, in turn. In this way members of the pool
retained continuous eligibility for insurance benefits. The system came to
be known as 'OXO' because of the arrangement of alternating days of work
(O) and unemployment (X).
41. Short-time working was also a way of reducing the threat of overproduction

63. The desire to reduce labour turnover is to be seen in the qualifying period
and the length of service recognised in many firms by a bigger share in
profits. For example in the case of Associated Portland Cement Manufac-
turers Ltd, employees of ten years' service or more received five times the
bonus of the employee with one year's service. J. Ramage, 'Profit-sharing

77. There were numerous such systems, differing mainly in how the worker was
compensated for time saved. Oversimplifying, the most favourable system
to the worker was the Weir system which usually credited the worker with
half of the time saved; the Halsey system assigned one third of time savings

to the worker; while the least favourable from the worker's point of view was
the Rowan system which credited the worker with a variable amount which
was geared in such a way that it usually did not exceed a quarter of the
saving. The Weir system was developed by G.& J. Weir at their engineering
works at Cathcart on Clydeside. The Halsey system was introduced from
the USA in the late nineteenth century. Sometimes elements of the two
systems were joined together and proved popular in engineering in Britain.
J. J. Gillespie, Training in Foremanship and Management (1943). The Rowan
system was developed by the Glasgow marine engineering firm of David
Rowan & Co. in 1898. It was the most complicated and least generous to
the pieceworker.
78. In engineering it came to be accepted that a pieceworker of average ability
should be able to earn 25 per cent over the existing time rate for the job
concerned. Powell, Payment, p. 88. In 1919 the minimum piecework standard
was formally fixed by the EEF and the ASE at 33.3 per cent and was reduced
to 25 per cent in 1931.

pension schemes could be a way of compulsorily retiring older or less
effective staff without damaging morale within the firm. See H. F. Gospel,

arrangements were the Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committees.
These were a temporary form of joint body established in less well organised
industries. In addition in 1919 there were 50 trade boards in industries
where organisation on both sides was so poor that voluntary collective
bargaining could not be established. The intention behind both the interim
industrial reconstruction committees and the trade boards was that, as
organisation improved on both sides, collective bargaining would develop
and national joint industrial councils would be established.

and District Miners' Industrial Union to coordinate the drift back to work.
This also had some support in Derbyshire and S. Wales and was assisted
by the owners in these coalfields. Spencerism ceased to exist in the late
1930s. See A. R. and C. P. Griffin, 'The Non-Political Trade Union Move-

where such arrangements did not exist, standard wage rates throughout an
industry could act as a substitute for price fixing or could at least take
wages out of competition between firms.
51. Recognition was, however, subject to certain important qualifications - for
the most part only manual unions were recognised and most employers
were not prepared to concede the closed-shop principle. On white-collar
recognition, see footnote 6 above. Employers tried to keep out trade union-
ism for foremen and supervisory staff. On the closed shop, informal arrange-
ments existed for some craftsmen in areas of engineering, shipbuilding,
printing, iron and steel, and cotton textiles. However, with the exception
of the shipowners and the National Union of Seamen from 1921 onwards,
more formal closed shops were rare and were opposed by British employers
throughout the interwar years. See W. E. J. McCarthy, The Closed Shop in

26. Management development began to spread in Great Britain in the 1950s
among a few large firms which tended to follow American business practice.
See R. Lewis and R. Stewart, The Boss: The Life and Times of the British
_Business Man (1958); A. Mant, The Rise and Fall of the British Manager_
(1977), p. 122; S.P. Keeble, 'University Education', pp. 167 and 202-20 on
graduate trainee programmes. Both Keeble and Chandler, Economic History
_Review, 1980, argue that the problem was more on the demand side than_
the supply side.
27. See Keeble, 'University Education'. London and Manchester Business
Schools were founded in the mid-1960s to develop management education
and other departments of management studies were established. For an
optimistic view of the improvement in the educational attainment of British
managers see British Institute of Management, Profile of the British Manager

of electric arc and basic oxygen steel processes, these offered advantages
in terms of lower energy costs, increased yield from raw material, and
improved quality. In the case of the float glass process, this was developed
by Pilkingtons in the 1950s because of its lower costs, higher quality, and
greater profit potential. In the case of changes in brewing and baking the
aim was to use ingredients more cost effectively and to speed up processes.

72. In the 1950s, in addition to time study with a stop watch, new techniques
were introduced from the US and developed by British consultants. Known
collectively as predetermined motion-time study, these involved analysing
jobs in terms of their basic components and using so-called 'synthetic' times
to establish how long it took to carry out a job. Department of Employment,

12. It is difficult to show this in detail, but it is suggested by the fact that where
there was collusion, as in electrical contracting or baking, it continued to
exist; in industries where there was strong competition, as in engineering,
employer solidarity declined. See A. J. Mclvor 'Employers' Associations
and Industrial Relations in Lancashire 1890-1939', Ph.D. thesis

28. Of course, not all firms recognised this. F. Zweig, Productivity and Trade
_Unions (1951), points out that 'some firms may have adapted themselves_
so well to the practice that they do not feel it at all or do not realise its
existence' p. 19. See also A. Aldridge, Power, Authority and Restrictive
_Practices (Oxford, 1976). A. Fox, A Sociology of Work in Industry (1971),_

48. Various attempts have been made to measure trade union wage power and
pressure. There are those who have looked at the proportion of the labour
force unionised e.g. A. G. Hines, 'Trade Unions and Wage Inflation in the
United Kingdom: 1893-1961' Review of Economic Studies 31 (1964) and A.
G. Hines, 'The Determinants of the Rate of Change of Money Wage Rates
and the Effectiveness of Incomes Policy' in H. G. Johnson and A. R. Nobay
(eds.) The Current Inflation (1971). There are those who have included
strike frequency e.g. L. G. Godfrey, 'The Phillips Curve: Incomes Policy
and Trade Union Effects' in ibid, and D. Laidler, 'Inflation: Alternative
Explanations and Policies; Tests and Data Drawn from Six Countries' in
K. Brunner and A. Metzler (eds.) Institutions, Policies and Economic Perform-
_ance (New York, 1976). Others have looked at the trade union mark-up_
over non-union wage rates e.g. R. Layard et al, 'The Effect of Collective
Bargaining on Relative and Absolute Wages', British Journal of Industrial
_Relations 16 (1978). In the case of the latter, the relative wage advantage_
of union over non-union labour steadily increased from the early 1960s
onwards. M. B. Stewart, 'Relative Earnings and Individual Union Member-
ship in the UK', Economica 50 (1983) probably provides the best estimate
of the differential at around 8 per cent.

41. I am indebted to J. Richards and E. Szyszczak for this information. See in
particular their 'Guaranteed Week Agreements in the Vehicle Industry',
Short-Time Working Project, Working Paper Number 13, University of
Kent (1984), and 'Short-time Working in Great Britain: Historical Develop-
ments and the Decline of Unemployment Benefit for Short-time Compensa-
tion', Working Paper Number 15, (1985). In this area legislation and
government policy have also lent some support to voluntary arrangements.
The Employment Protection Act 1975 introduced statutory guaranteed
payments subject to a maximum amount and maximum period. Between
1978 and 1984, in a series of ad hoc measures aimed at averting redundancies
and the payment of unemployment benefit, governments operated a state-
funded system of short-time compensation.

56. Ibid. p. 52. This also claimed that over time the industrial training boards
came to favour more firm-specific training, p. 59. M. Oakey argues that
firms training in firm-specific skills got a double pay off from the levy-grant
system in that they received a direct return from their investment and were
also paid a grant towards the cost of that investment. M. Oakey, The
Economics of Training With Respect to the Firm', British Journal of Indus-

minding jobs meant non-apprenticed training at least was more firm specific.
