The study suggests that the challenges of labor reallocation are greater today due to lower population growth and the need for industry-specific skills.",
    "long_term_impacts": "The study suggests that structural change poses challenges for labor reallocation, potentially leading to structural unemployment due to the scrapping of industry-specific skills."
