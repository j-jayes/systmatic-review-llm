      "The longstanding view in US economic history is that the shift in manufacturing in the nineteenth century from the hand labor artisan shop to the machine labor of the mechanized factory led to ' labor de-skilling ' -the substitution of less skilled workers, such as operatives, for skilled craft workers."
