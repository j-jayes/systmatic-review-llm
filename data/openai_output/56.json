    "main_findings": "The study finds that structural change has had varying impacts on productivity growth and labor market conditions over time. Initially, structural change contributed positively to productivity growth, but from the mid-1960s, its contribution became negative. The extent of sectoral reallocation of labor has increased over time, particularly in the postwar period.",

The reallocation of labor from contracting to expanding industries has become more significant, posing new challenges for the labor market.",
